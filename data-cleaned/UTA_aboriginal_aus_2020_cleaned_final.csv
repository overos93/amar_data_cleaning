The 22-year-old is a member of the Kaurna Boomerangs: Australia's first ever Indigenous ice hockey team. The squad, whose players range in age from 13 to early 20s, travelled to Edmonton to take part in a cultural exchange with Cree nations in northern Alberta. On Saturday, the team worked through jet lag during a practice on the rink at Rogers Place. Burgoyne said skating on the Edmonton Oilers' home ice was a ""surreal"" experience, and that its been an adjustment acclimatizing not only to the weather, but also to Canadian culture. ""I rocked up and I got told 'we're in Canada, we don't say ice hockey here, we just say hockey,'"" he said, explaining field hockey is the more popular game in Australia. The Boomerangs were formed and began training two years ago, as part of the Ice Factor program: a longstanding initiative that gets disadvantaged youth involved in hockey. Based out of Adelaide, Australia, Ice Factor was founded by Marie Shaw, whose own daughter had her life turned around after falling in love with the sport. When Shaw heard southern Australia's only ice rink was set for closure, she got involved in efforts to save it, and ended up founding the now 15-year-old organization that has seen 3,000 young people participate, and is connected to 18 Australian high schools. Two years ago, a pair of young Indigenous men approached Shaw about the possibility of forming an Indigenous team. She threw her support behind them, and helped make possible the trip to Canada to play against and connect with Indigenous teams here. ""You need to have a dream, and you need to believe in it,"" she said. Burgoyne, who is Mirning and Narungga, is one of the 18 Indigenous players of the team. He said he was a bit of a ""run-amok"" when he entered high school years ago. He credits the Ice Factor program with helping him to stay motivated and stay the course through school. ""The program has helped me out a lot. I've finished school, I've got a job, got a family,"" he said. The team will gear-up for on-skates events in Edmonton, Maskwacis, and Calling Lake. In the city, they'll visit Amiskwaciy Academy, RCMP K Division, West Edmonton Mall, and bundle up for a skate on at the Ottewell Community League's outdoor rink. The Boomerangs will take in some high level hockey as spectators during their trip: watching the Oil Kings take on the Prince Albert Raiders on Jan. 17, and the Oilers versus the Arizona Coyotes on Jan. 18. The hockey players will fly back to Australia on Jan. 19.

The respected Aboriginal Christian leader invited the congregation in the city centre to “come on a journey with Aboriginal people … we’re going to change this nation.” The service was one of 23 #ChangetheHeart services around the country to call on Christians to gather, pray, lament and hear the truth about past injustices and discrimination still faced by Aboriginal people. The service was led by Brooke Prentis, who is about to take up her role as CEO of Common Grace. Prentis opened the service by saying she wanted “friendship, not reconciliation, between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.” Aunty Jean and Lea Maslen started these services seven years ago. They have been gathering prominence and momentum; along with meeting in Sydney Anglicanism’s prime property, Aunty Jean will speak tonight at a service in St Paul’s Anglican Cathedral in Melbourne. #ChangetheHeart service at St Andrew’s Anglican Cathedral Despite this progress in awareness of the #ChangetheHeart movement, Aunty Jean said that in Brisbane, her hometown, and all around the country, life is not easy for Aboriginal people. They face homelessness, poverty and prison. “And we in Christian ministry are caught up with all of those things and it’s not easy,” she said. “Most Aboriginal ministry in this country has never been supported by the church and that’s just so sad. “The churches in this country really have inherited so much from what has happened to our people – and we don’t begrudge them for that, but we don’t have those kinds of luxuries. Most Aboriginal ministries have never been supported.” She then spoke of some of the 12 Aboriginal pastors who have passed away over the past 12 months, including Stan Grant’s Aunty, Flo Grant, who had fought the churches for justice for many years. “I want to ask every church in Australia to adopt someone in Aboriginal ministry …” – Aunty Jean Phillips She quoted Aboriginal Lutheran Pastor George Rosendale, who passed away a few months ago, as saying “there will never be reconciliation and revival in this country until we acknowledge the theft of this land and what has happened to Aboriginal people.” “We don’t want your churches or your buildings back, but you need to acknowledge it and to help us to face those challenges and those needs that are before us,” she said. Aunty Jean then put out a challenge: “I want to ask every church in Australia to adopt someone in Aboriginal ministry for prayer, for friendship and to pay their resources.” She mentioned that South Brisbane Anglican Church had raised money to pay the registration for the vehicles of “our people” going into Aboriginal ministries. “Well, that’s good but Australia has the responsibility of supporting the First Nations people in their ministries. You wouldn’t know the poverty until you come and live with us in the Aboriginal community,” she said. Aunty Jean also called on churches to reach out and help young Aboriginal people including those in prison. “The sin of this nation – a lot of our kids are locked up in prison because of stealing and, yet, the theft of this land has never been dealt with,” she said. “I’ll be writing to all the heads of churches – and asking what they’re doing about chaplaincy and doing things with these young people. All the wealth that they’ve got – remember, the wealth that has come because of what has happened to Aboriginal people. Aunty Jean called on church leaders to invite an Aboriginal minister to come and preach at their meetings. “That’s why we’re calling on you tonight to come and join us and pray. “Get to know us. I’m not going to growl at you. I do growl sometimes. But we’re all coming to join together. The Prime Minister or the government is not going to change Australia, but you and I are going to change us – when you pledge tonight to pray that we might be able to change this nation through true reconciliation.” Aunty Jean called on church leaders to invite an Aboriginal minister to come and preach at their meetings. She recommended Aboriginal pastor Ray Minniecon – who was at last night’s service – as a “great biblical teacher”. “Ray, will you come up here, son. Come on, come on up,” Aunty Jean beckoned to Uncle Ray. While standing with Aunty Jean, he suggested that the congregation give Aboriginal pastors a surprise and visit them on Sunday, January 26. “If you want to join us at Aboriginal church services, then surprise Michael Duckett out at St Peter’s in Campbelltown, or you can go out to Tregear to Richard Manton – give him a big surprise,” encouraged Uncle Ray. “You have an Aboriginal ministry also in Redfern, Elizabeth Street with Matthew Paterson, or you can come to St John’s in Glebe and join us there. So, please, you’re always welcome; come and meet us and enjoy our fellowship in Christ.” Aunty Jean urged the congregation not to criticise Aboriginal people for marching on Sunday “because they’re hurting and that’s the only opportunity that they have of telling their stories”. She said that presented an “opportunity of reaching out to those people and telling them of God’s love”. “So, don’t criticise them; pray for them and get your minister to pray for us all together on Sunday – praying for the relationships between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people.” Related stories from around the web Common Grace Eternity News is not responsible for the content on other websites Sunday, June 5, is World Environment Day: the United Nations’ day to highlight care for… Sunday, June 5, is World Environment Day: the United Nations’ day to highlight care for… In Canada, in the freezing cold, there was a long, long line of people waiting… In Canada, in the freezing cold, there was a long, long line of people waiting… With only 15% of Australians attending church on a Sunday, Christians need to be seen in our world.

The court found Aboriginal people held a special status and were exempt from immigration laws, after it considered the cases of two convicted criminals whom the Government wanted to deport. The two men, Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, had failed their migration character tests as a result of serving jail sentences. In a 4-3 split, the court found Aboriginal Australians were not subject to the alien powers in the constitution and therefore could not be deported. But the judges did not clear Mr Love entirely, saying they could not reach agreement on whether he was an Aboriginal person on the facts stated in the case. After this morning's ruling, Mr Thoms was released from detention in Brisbane. The 31-year-old told the ABC he was struggling to believe he was finally free. He said he found it hard to stay positive while in immigration limbo. ""After 17 months it was starting to wear on me,"" he said. ""I really just was thinking about my son a lot and all the fighting was for him ... That's why I put up a fight."" ""The lawyers did a really good job and it's good win for Aboriginal people."" Both men were born overseas but moved to Australia as children and held permanent residency visas. Mr Love, a recognised member of the Kamilaroi people but born in Papua New Guinea, was placed in immigration detention after he was sentenced to more than a year in jail for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A delegate for Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton had cancelled the 40-year-old's visa, but that decision was later revoked and he was released. Mr Thoms was born in New Zealand and also lacks Australian citizenship, though he is a native title holder as a member of the Gunggari people. After serving part of an 18-month sentence for a domestic violence assault, he was taken into immigration detention, where he had remained until today's outcome. Outside the High Court, one of the men's lawyers, Claire Gibbs, said Mr Thoms was ""incredibly relieved"" by the judgement. ""He's missed two Christmases with his family [and] one of his son's birthdays. His son's birthday is coming up again so he's hopeful of returning to celebrate with his family."" Ms Gibbs said the ruling was not about citizenship, but was instead about ""who is an Australian national and who is a part of the Australian community"". ""It's about the use of alien powers, which we believe the government has been using inconsistently, unfairly and, now we've proven, unlawfully,"" she said. ""So, in a practical sense, Brendan is still a New Zealand citizen, but he's not an alien in this country and he's protected from being deported. ""Aboriginal Australians can no longer be removed from the country that they know and the country that they have a very close connection with."" Ms Gibbs said while the court did not make a determination about Mr Love's ""Aboriginality"", she was confident lawyers could prove that was the case. The president of the Law Council of Australia, Pauline Wright, welcomed the decision, saying it confirmed that questions about membership of Aboriginal societies were beyond the Parliament's legislative power. She said the judgment raised several other ""complex issues which require careful consideration"". In an unusual move, the High Court held two separate hearings into the case. It was originally heard in May last year, but came back in December after the court suggested the parties consider whether Aboriginal people occupy a special position, backed up by common law recognition of native title rights. If that was the case, the court said it then followed that the crown had a unique obligation to protect Aboriginal society, and in return Aboriginal people owed a permanent allegiance to the crown. Lawyers for the men submitted that Aboriginal people could not be ""alien"" to Australia. ""Aboriginal Australians are a permanent part of the Australian community,"" they wrote in a submission. The submissions also stated that, at Federation, Aboriginal people were not considered ""aliens"" under the constitution. But the Commonwealth told the court any person who was not a citizen was an ""alien"" under the law, and that Mr Thoms and Mr Love owed their allegiance to the countries they were born in.

1027,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-51581894,Anzac Day: Aboriginal flag row in Western Australia,"A decision to ban the Aboriginal flag and other forms of recognition from Anzac Day services in Western Australia (WA) has sparked widespread backlash. Each year, solemn ceremonies are held on 25 April in Australia and New Zealand to commemorate veterans and soldiers. But a veterans' organisation said it would no longer allow Aboriginal displays at its services in the state. It added that all content, except the NZ anthem, must be in English. The Returned Service League (RSL) has previously been criticised for ignoring and diminishing the service of Aboriginal soldiers in World War One and other conflicts. The decision follows a move last year where the Ode of Remembrance was read at a ceremony in an Aboriginal language, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Critics, among them indigenous and non-indigenous lawmakers, have called the move ""offensive"" and demanded it be reversed. Another day in WA as @RSLWA bans the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags at ANZAC and Remembrance Day services. You refused to acknowledge when mob served, and now you continue to refuse to acknowledge us. The new policy for the state's RSL also prohibits Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country ceremonies - which have become commonplace around Australia. The brief protocols acknowledge indigenous connection to the land, and are commonly read out or performed at the commencement of a formal gathering or event. However, the RSLWA said such gestures at Anzac Day or Remembrance Day ceremonies would be inappropriate. ""While having utmost respect for the traditional owners of land upon which such sites and memorials are located, RSLWA does not view it appropriate that a Welcome to Country is used at sites that were specifically established to pay homage to those who died and who came from a wide range of cultural backgrounds,"" their policy reads. Anzac Day has become a flashpoint for controversy in Australia in recent years, and sparked debates on national identity. Critics say the ""Anzac"" legend, which focuses on Australia and New Zealand's campaign at Gallipoli in World War One, prioritises a white-Anglo narrative and glorifies a battle where many Allied soldiers died. According to the Australian War Memorial, at least 1,000 indigenous Australians are recorded to have fought for their nation in WW1, and ""the real number is probably higher"". ""It is not known what motivated Indigenous Australians to join the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but loyalty and patriotism doubtless played a part,"" says the memorial's website.

The briefing note from the mothballed evidence-based policing unit, obtained under freedom of information laws by Guardian Australia, found that Aboriginal drivers received 3.2 times more fines from being pulled over by police than non-Aboriginal drivers. But when tickets were issued by traffic cameras, Aboriginal drivers received slightly fewer penalties on average than non-Aboriginal drivers. This article includes content provided by Scribd. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. The five-year analysis included 69% of all drivers in WA, and showed a “notable ethnic disparity” in the issuing of traffic fines. However, police said they had not acted on the report because decisions on what actions would be taken to reduce Aboriginal incarceration were a matter for cabinet. On average, the report found, Aboriginal drivers in WA receive 1.75 times more penalty units over their lifetime of driving than non-Aboriginal drivers. That is about $1,260 more in fines for Aboriginal drivers, “almost entirely driven by police-initiated, on-the-spot infringements”. It also found Aboriginal drivers were carrying 6.2 times more unpaid fines — amounting to a debt of $2,327. Until last year, police in Western Australia had the power to arrest and jail people for unpaid court fines – and accumulated traffic offences can often end up in court. Drivers with unpaid fines cannot renew their licence, and repeatedly driving unlicensed can result in jail time. “These differences are large enough to suggest an uncomfortable distinction between automated camera and police-initiated traffic enforcement, with this distinction heavily correlated with Aboriginality,” the report by WA Police’s then director of criminology, Dr Geoffrey Barnes, said. The final report was dated 13 February 2019, and recommended further investigation of the “clearly disturbing” trend, concluding: “These findings are consistent with a notable ethnic disparity in police-initiated traffic enforcement, but by no means provide conclusive evidence that deliberate bias exists.” Barnes, who joined WA Police as its first in-house criminologist in May 2017, said the research was unique because traffic cameras provided a control group. “We know that automated traffic enforcement doesn’t detect the difference between the two ethnic groups,” he told Guardian Australia. “Therefore, if we’re only finding it in stops, well that that is an indication that there’s a discretionary element going on … Even if it’s not racism, we don’t want this pattern to exist.” Barnes said the evidence-based policing unit began to lose resources in December 2018, when the deputy commissioner Stephen Brown, who established the unit, left the force. By the time Barnes left WA Police, on 16 January this year, he said he was effectively the only one left. The only person who tried to get traction on his reports was his boss, the assistant commissioner Craig Ward. Ward commissioned the report and presented it to a working group on Aboriginal wellbeing, set up to report to cabinet on the McGowan government’s pledge to reduce the number of Aboriginal people in custody. He told Guardian Australia that the decision to respond to the report would be a matter for cabinet and that WA police no longer had the staff to do the follow-up research that Barnes recommend. “That’s not with any intention to cover it up,” Ward said. “I think it’s frankly a fantastic report and asks us the kind of questions we need to face ... [but] it was about trying to get the best outcome and the best audience at government level to receive this so we could have a whole-of-government outcome.” Dennis Eggington, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA), said the report, shown to him by Guardian Australia, contained “no surprises, no shocks,” but he was disappointed it had not been acted on. “It just confirms what we as Aboriginal people know and are subjected to,” he said. “I certainly now will be taking the issue up with our police commissioner here in WA to see whether or not we can all work together with the information there to help make things better.” Police in Australia have the power to stop any driver, at any time, to conduct a random breath test, even if they can’t see any offences occurring. It’s a discretionary power, and one Eggington said every Aboriginal person he knows has experienced. “It happens all the time,” he said. “It happens personally to me, it’s happened personally to all my family members.” Eggington said WA police had problems with racism, both systemic and personal, but that the relationship between ALSWA and police had improved. “All colonial institutions have a problem with systemic racism,” he said. Ward said the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in police-led infringements could be due to a lack of traffic cameras in regional areas, meaning most infringements were issued directly by police. He also said that when police pulled someone over they could issue fines for more than one thing. “[If] it’s a three-car family from the western suburbs, and you’re driving along in your Land Cruiser and you’re the only person in the car speeding because you can and that’s your car, it stops there,” Ward said. “If you’re driving from [the remote Pilbara community of] Jigalong to Newman and you have pulled over and there’s 10 people in the car, and it’s unroadworthy, and you haven’t got a licence and the car’s not registered, that’s a different outcome.” Barnes said a number of sworn police officers described similar scenarios in which extra demerit points might be accumulated by Aboriginal drivers. “Believe me I heard all kinds of assumptive arguments when I wrote this,” he said. “But in the end we have this aggregate trend.” Aboriginal drivers in regional areas received 4.2 times more penalty units from police stops than non-Indigenous drivers, and 41% of all traffic infringements to Aboriginal drivers were issued in regional areas, the report found. The biggest disparity was in the issuing of infringements for not wearing a seatbelt, where Aboriginal drivers received 19.2 times the number of fines. Asked whether the report showed evidence of structural racism in WA police, Ward said that was “certainly something that I thought initially”. But he said he then concluded the disparity was due to government policies for police to target certain types of offences. “Police officers will pretty much follow instructions,” he said. WA police has, in recent years, made efforts to repair its relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, starting with an apology from the commissioner, Chris Dawson, for “past wrongful actions”, issuing Aboriginal service medals to police officers and staff, and a focus on recruiting Aboriginal cadets. Ward said WA police had an “internal communication journey to go on to make sure everyone is on board” with that agenda. “What we do not want to do, as I said, is make a kneejerk response to this, walk around accusing people of unconscious bias or whatever it may be that may set our agenda backwards,” he said.",AUS,aboriginal,0,0,1,2

An Indigenous team will face a Maori team in the annual pre-season match at Cbus Super Stadium on 22 February. ARLC chairman Peter V'landys said:external-link ""We have listened to our players' concerns that the words of the anthem do not represent them or their families.""

1302,https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahryan/aboriginal-constitution-aliens-high-court-love-thoms,"Aboriginal People Are Not ""Aliens"" And Cannot Be Deported, Australia's High Court Declares","“Aboriginal people, regardless of where they are born, have permanent protection form deportation,"" said a lawyer representing the men. BuzzFeed News Reporter, Australia Daniel Love with his mother. Two Aboriginal men who were held in immigration detention in Australia have won their landmark High Court case, with a slim majority deciding that their unique connection to the country means they cannot be deported from it. The two men who brought the case — Brendan Thoms and Daniel Love — had argued that their Aboriginal identity meant they could not be considered ""aliens"" under the Constitution, and that they therefore could not be deported. On Tuesday morning four out of the seven High Court justices found in their favour, ruling Aboriginal Australians could not fit the description of ""alien"" as it appears in the constitution. ""Aboriginal Australians have a special cultural, historical and spiritual connection with the territory of Australia, which is central to their traditional laws and customs and which is recognised by the common law,"" a summary of the majority decision read. It went on to say that existence of that connection is ""inconsistent"" with holding that an Aboriginal Australian can be an alien under the constitution. Thoms was released on Tuesday afternoon after 501 days in immigration detention. But the court was unable to agree on whether Love is Aboriginal and the ruling cannot yet be applied to him. The issue will be considered at a future hearing. Thoms has been in detention since September 2018, with the government planning to deport him to New Zealand. Love, who holds Papua New Guinean citizenship, was released after seven weeks in detention and sought compensation. Both were born elsewhere, and never applied for citizenship despite being entitled to it, but have lived in Australia since they were children. Their permanent visas were cancelled after convictions for criminal offences. Both identify, and are recognised, as Aboriginal: Love is a member of the Kamilaroi people, and Thoms is a member of the Gunggari people and also holds native title. Both are also fathers to Australian children. The decision, one of the most significant in the court's recent history, is the court's most explicit recognition of the special position occupied by Indigenous people in Australia since it recognised the existence of native title in Mabo in 1992. Claire Gibbs, a senior associate at Maurice Blackburn who represented Love and Thoms, told BuzzFeed News the two men felt ""incredible relief"" at the decision. Despite the lingering uncertainty over Love's fate, Gibbs said she was ""very confident"" he would be able to prove he is Aboriginal and have the decision apply to him. She said the decision is likely to affect a small number of other Aboriginal Australians currently in detention. ""This is relevant to Aboriginal people who are born overseas. We know it is a small but very vulnerable class of Australians,"" she said. ""Aboriginal people, regardless of where they are born, have permanent protection from deportation which is crucially important to the continuance of their culture."" The case was filed in September 2018 and first heard by the full court in May 2019, which meant Love and Thoms have waited an unusually long time for resolution of their case by the High Court. The court also took the unusual step of calling the parties back for further argument in December last year. At least 16 other people have had visas cancelled or refused despite claiming to be Indigenous. Lane Sainty contributed reporting.  Hannah Ryan is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Sydney.

Barry Port was a legend in Far North Queensland, particularly at Coen in Cape York, where the town's public bar is named in his honour. Mr Port, who would comb the Cape's harsh terrain for criminal, traffic and missing persons cases, hung up his hat several years ago to enjoy fishing on the Coen River. Aged in his 70s, he died at home on Wednesday night from a heart condition. ""Dignified, humble, caring — such a rare kind of gentleman,"" Dianne MacDonald wrote on social media. ""The world has lost a beautiful soul."" Duane Port said his grandfather would be ""deeply missed"" and that his death had come as a shock. The quietly-spoken Lama Lama elder learnt traditional bush skills from his father, who learnt from his father before him. They did not own a car so they would hunt on foot and look for fresh tracks from pigs. Mr Port's tracking ability and bush skills caught the attention of police in 1980. He was signed up and would spend more than 30 years pursuing drug dealers, escaped prisoners and cattle rustlers. ""We'd go out looking for drugs, people camping in the bush who had set up big plantations, and once we found it we'd destroy it all,"" Mr Port told the ABC in 2018. ""You could follow their footsteps through the scrub, they'd make a bit of a track to their crop. ""It was a pretty dangerous job — the dealers, they've got guns and knives and you'd have to be very careful."" Mr Port's funeral will be held later this month.

The National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) Tuesday denounced that two Embera indigenous people, Omar Guasiruma and Ernesto Guasiruma, were killed and two more were wounded in the Naranjal township in the Cauca Valley. RELATED: Colombia's Indigenous Demand Justice After 20 Leaders Killed ""The two murdered Indigenous leaders and the two wounded belong to the same family and were at home following the quarantine order,"" the ONIC tweeted. The Kankuamo leader Luis Kankui indicated that the attack against the Guasiruma family occurred on Monday night. So far no further details are known about the criminal attack. Despite the 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian state and the then-Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the social leaders' situation continues to be precarious. According to human rights defenders, authorities make little effort to identify, arrest, and imprison members of the ""Gulf Clan"" paramilitaries and other far-right groups.

The decision to fall into the hole or go through the portal is up to you. If they repent of the problem and consume the news 24 hours a day, with little energy, nervous all the time, with pessimism, they will fall into the hole. But if you take this opportunity to look at yourself, rethink life and death, take care of yourself and others, you will cross the portal. Take care of your home, take care of your body. Connect with the middle body of your spiritual house, all this is synonymous, that is to say the same. When you are taking care of one, you are taking care of everything else. Do not lose the spiritual dimension of this crisis, have the aspect of the eagle, which from above, sees the whole, sees more widely. There is a social demand in this crisis, but there is also a spiritual demand. The two go hand in hand. Without the social dimension, we fall into fanaticism. But without the spiritual dimension, we fall into pessimism and lack of meaning. You were prepared to go through this crisis. Take your toolbox and use all the tools at your disposal. Learn about resistance with indigenous and African peoples: we have always been and continue to be exterminated. But we still haven’t stopped singing, dancing, lighting a fire and having fun. Don’t feel guilty about being happy during this difficult time. You don’t help at all by being sad and without energy. It helps if good things emanate from the Universe now. It is through joy that one resists. Also, when the storm passes, you will be very important in the reconstruction of this new world. You need to be well and strong. And, for that, there is no other way than to maintain a beautiful, happy and bright vibration. This has nothing to do with alienation. This is a resistance strategy. In shamanism, there is a rite of passage called the quest for vision. You spend a few days alone in the forest, without water, without food, without protection. When you go through this portal, you get a new vision of the world, because you have faced your fears, your difficulties… This is what is asked of you. What world do you want to build for yourself? For now, this is what you can do: serenity in the storm. Calm down and pray. Everyday. Establish a routine to meet the sacred every day. Good things emanate, what you emanate now is the most important thing. And sing, dance, resist through art, joy, faith and love.” Artist, Free Thinker, Writer/Speaker On these platforms I will be sharing art, my writing, posting stories from travels, life experiences, adventures, sharing news articles and much more.

Please read our Commenting Policy first. Saskatchewan’s premier says First Nations are receiving mixed messages after Canada’s Indigenous services minister said sacred ceremonies would be allowed to continue despite restrictions put in place due to COVID-19. READ MORE: ‘Inadequate’ COVID-19 funding focus of new court challenge by Indigenous group “No one should be exempt from these health orders because, quite frankly, no one is exempt from the virus,” Scott Moe said Thursday afternoon. Concern about ceremonies surfaced after RCMP were dispatched to a Saskatchewan First Nation where people were holding a sun-dance ceremony last weekend. Organizers said they worried important traditions were being pushed back underground. A federal ban on Indigenous ceremonies and potlatches came into place in 1884 and lasted until the 1950s. Minister Marc Miller said earlier Thursday that banning sacred ceremonies is a “dark stain” on the country’s history. “Even in the face of a historic pandemic, Canada must not and will not prohibit these important practices,” Miller said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Indigenous community leaders know what needs to be done to keep people safe. “We should be able to work with them to develop ways of continuing with important customs and practices for them in a way that abides by health recommendations,” he said. Saskatchewan RCMP said they received two reports of a large public gathering on the Beardy’s and Okemasis Cree Nation, about 90 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, on Sunday. READ MORE: RCMP attendance at Indigenous ceremony in Saskatchewan raises ire of chief There were 35 people taking part in the ceremony, but attendees said they were following precautions set by the chief and council, including social distancing and having temperatures taken. A public-health order in Saskatchewan limits gatherings to 10 people. The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, has said provincial public-health orders do not supersede First Nations laws and treaties. Indigenous Services Canada did not clarify who has jurisdiction to enforce provincial public-health orders on First Nations. Spokesperson Leslie Michelson said in an email that First Nations leaders are encouraged to consider public-health guidelines and the department respects measures put in place by chiefs and councils. Miller said First Nations leadership will ultimately decide whether to go ahead with ceremonies and how to do it. Moe, however, said there should be no exceptions, since everyone relies on the provincial health system. “With respect to the comments of the minister, as well as Indigenous Services themselves, around these particular events being exempt from public health orders — that simply cannot be the case,” Moe said. There were 185 positive cases of COVID-19 on First Nations reserves as of Wednesday, with 43 of them in Saskatchewan.

The Declaration is the most comprehensive international instrument on the rights of Indigenous peoples. It establishes a universal framework of minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the Indigenous peoples of the world and it elaborates on existing human rights standards and fundamental freedoms as they apply to Indigenous peoples. The Declaration is particularly significant because Indigenous peoples, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, were involved in its drafting.

development and proper management of the environment, Emphasizing the contribution of the demilitarization of the lands and territories of indigenous peoples to peace, economic and social progress and development, understanding and friendly relations among nations and peoples of the world, Recognizing in particular the right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well-being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child, Considering that the rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character, Considering also that treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements, and the relationship they represent, are the basis for a strengthened partnership between indigenous peoples and States, Acknowledging that the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, affirm the fundamental importance of the right of self-determination of all peoples, by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development, Bearing in mind that nothing in this Declaration may be used to deny any peoples their right of self-determination, exercised in conformity with international law, Convinced that the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples in this Declaration will enhance harmonious and cooperative relations between the State and indigenous peoples, based on principles of justice, democracy, respect for human rights, non-discrimination and good faith, Encouraging States to comply with and effectively implement all their obligations as they apply to indigenous peoples under international instruments, in particular those related to human rights, in consultation and cooperation with the peoples concerned, Emphasizing that the United Nations has an important and continuing role to play in promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, Believing that this Declaration is a further important step forward for the recognition, promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms of indigenous peoples and in the development of relevant activities of the United Nations system in this field, Recognizing and reaffirming that indigenous individuals are entitled without discrimination to all human rights recognized in international law, and that indigenous peoples possess collective rights which are indispensable for their existence, well-being and integral development as peoples, Recognizing also that the situation of indigenous peoples varies from region to region and from country to country and that the significance of national and regional

The inquest into the death of their mother following a fall while in Castlemaine police station found that unconscious race bias had played at least some part in her arrest. While the coroner fell short of labelling the neglectful actions of the attending police as such (though they were found to have violated Day’s human rights), she did find that the train conductor had made judgement calls based on Day’s Aboriginality which contributed to him calling the police on her in her intoxicated state. In other words, had Tanya – who had a valid ticket – been left to merely sleep on the train like so many other intoxicated commuters who aren’t Aboriginal are, she might still be with us today. This finding followed an earlier victory Ms Day’s incredible children had achieved: that “public drunkenness” would be removed from the criminal code in Victoria. In 2019, the Victorian premier promised this would happen – a mere 28 years after this recommendation was handed down by the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody because it was found that such laws disproportionately criminalised Aboriginal people. It’s thanks to the family of Tanya Day that all Victorians now have the right to make it safely home, without police interference, no matter what our state. I mention this case because it’s one that everyone who lives in Victoria, and Australia, should know. Day’s family joined the countless other heartbroken Aboriginal families in this country who have had to embark on a journey for justice for their loved ones who have died in police custody. Over 430 of them, incidentally, since the royal commission findings were handed down. Yet despite the fact that this keeps happening, Australia mainly turns a blind eye to the problem, or bends over backwards to justify the fact that Aboriginal people are the most incarcerated race of people on the planet. It’s therefore been interesting, and disheartening, watching the Australian response to the riots happening in the US following the death of African American man George Floyd while in police custody. The world should be outraged by his death and should be taking action to ensure it never happens again. Yet the 24-7 coverage here shows just how much more newsworthy a Black death in custody from the US is here than the many Aboriginal deaths in Australia. I’ve had people on Twitter tell me that perhaps if there were riots here, there would be more interest. The thing is, there are riots here. Recently, Palm Island residents were awarded compensation after the federal court found police used excessive force on residents during riots following the 2004 death in custody of Mulrindji Doomadgee. Despite the fact that only Aboriginal people were imprisoned for what transpired on Palm Island, the best Nine News could muster in response to this compensation payout was a news report essentially accusing residents of fraud and reckless spending of “taxpayer monies”. Redfern rioted after 17-year-old TJ Hickey was killed riding a bike while police pursued him. His body was impaled on a fence. Yet I guarantee you that hardly any Australians remember these riots, let alone his name and the fact that his family are still calling for justice. Or what about Joyce Clarke, who was shot by police in Geraldton last year as she was apparently experiencing a mental health episode? The police officer who shot her entered a not guilty plea to his murder charge only days ago. Authorities at the time were so concerned there would be a riot following Clarke’s death that their racist solution was to ban alcohol sales to certain locals. How many in Australia would have taken to the streets for Joyce? Further salt is rubbed in the wound when we see Black Lives Matter solidarity rallies in Australia being organised without consultation with the people whose lives are impacted the most by police brutality on this soil – Aboriginal people. It’s fantastic that people know police actions can’t go on unchecked, and showing solidarity is key to racist institutions being challenged wherever they are in the world, but why is solidarity often lacking when it comes to Australia’s own atrocities? Why did a Black Lives Matter US solidarity rally in Melbourne in 2016 attract thousands, yet a rally to shut down Don Dale juvenile detention centre following police brutality enacted on Aboriginal children only two weeks later failed to generate anywhere near that level of public interest, even if that smaller crowd succeeded in closing down the Melbourne CBD until 2am? Truth is, a large part of it comes down to Australia’s inability to acknowledge and properly address its own racism. Wave after wave of immigrants can come here and experience Australia’s unique brand of racism yet still manage to be more accepted and higher up the social rungs than Aboriginal people will ever be. It’s too hard to deal with local issues, and therefore pointing at America and saying “but they’re worse” is an easy method of avoidance. Global solidarity for the lives of black people and the fight against institutional racism is so incredibly important. It’s in this solidarity and exchange that we find the strength to continue challenging in the hope that this never happens again. I only wish that while Australia is looking abroad for reasons why it should care, it would spend a bit of time ensuring that things change on this soil as well.

I still remember just thinking ‘why?’.” The Black Lives Matter protests that swept the globe following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in the US have cast a rare spotlight on the way Indigenous people are treated in Australia’s justice system. Last weekend, tens of thousands of people across the country defied warnings from MPs and health officials to march in solidarity with the movement, protesting against police brutality. Senior figures both in governments and the police have walked a careful line between acknowledging unequal treatment of Indigenous people in the justice system and attempting to distance Australia’s history from the US. In an interview this week the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was a “fair point” to raise issues about “people’s treatment in custody or things like that”, but then incorrectly claimed “there was no slavery in Australia”. Similarly the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, dismissed anti-police sentiment as the result of “something that happened in another country” in Sydney tabloid the Daily Telegraph. But despite those attempts to deflect criticism, the Guardian this week revealed an extraordinary disparity in the way Indigenous Australians were treated when caught with small amounts of cannabis. In NSW, police took 82.55% of all Indigenous people found with a non-indictable quantity of cannabis to court. The rate was 52.29% for the non-Indigenous population. The state also has a cannabis caution regime, designed to keep people out of the justice system for such minor offences. The cautions are issued at the discretion of individual police. Only 11.41% of Indigenous Australians found with cannabis were let off with such cautions, compared with 40.03% for non-Indigenous people. More detailed analysis shows the trend is more pronounced in greater Sydney, where 86.42% of Indigenous Australians caught with low-level amounts of cannabis were taken to court, compared with 46.12% for non-Indigenous offenders. In regional NSW, 80.57% of Indigenous Australians were taken to court for such offences. The rate was 63.73% for non-Indigenous people. About 12.07% of Indigenous Australians caught with cannabis in regional NSW received a caution, significantly less than the 27.52% of non-Indigenous offenders. There are, of course, limits on when and how cannabis cautions can be issued. Anyone with a history of drug offences, sexual offences or any offence involving violence is ineligible, and police can only give two warnings per individual. But Warner questioned why the restrictions around the scheme still existed if it was leading to “discriminatory” outcomes. “If we have got people who are essentially being charged for small amounts of cannabis and not receiving cautions and the police are saying ‘this is because of existing legislation’, why have we not changed the legislation?” she said. “If that legislation is by their own admission resulting in discriminatory outcomes where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults are less likely to receive a caution than non-Aboriginal people, why has there not been reform to get rid of that systemic discrimination?” She said even interactions with the justice system for minor offences increased the chances of Indigenous people being caught in the “quicksand” of the justice system, which could lead to incarceration. “The thing is, systematic racism is not someone else’s problem,” she said. “It’s our kids, it’s our mums and our dads [and] we all know that once people have that contact with the justice system they are just so much more likely to get stuck in that quicksand.” Cannabis offences are far from the only example of disparity in police enforcement, but significant failures in the transparency of Australia’s justice system mean that in most states and territories the data is only piecemeal. University of Technology Sydney professor Thalia Anthony, a leading voice on Indigenous justice issues, found similar trends for traffic offences such as driving unlicensed or driving unregistered. In Western Australia, Aboriginal drivers received 3.2 times more fines after being pulled over than non-Aboriginal drivers, according to data obtained by the Guardian from an internal police briefing note that described the disparity as “clearly disturbing”. Other data has shown Indigenous Australians were remarkably over-policed for public nuisance offences in Queensland. In 2017, University of Queensland professor Tamara Walsh obtained data showing about one in four of all adults and more than 40% of children charged with public nuisance were Indigenous. Only about 3.5% of the Queensland population is Indigenous. The consequences of over-policing cannot be overstated, according to the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac), a not-for-profit legal service that works to change policing practices disproportionately impacting Indigenous people. Piac principal solicitor Camilla Pandolfini said the research clearly shows that the earlier a young person is involved in the criminal justice system, the more likely they are to be entrenched. Pandolfini said the high rate of incarceration for Indigenous Australians can only be reversed by tackling every decision made “at every step of the criminal justice system”. That includes decisions by police on who they target, who they stop and search, and who they offer warnings, cautions, and other diversions away from the courts. “Research consistently shows that the earlier a young person is involved with the criminal justice system, the more likely they are to become further involved in that system,” she said. “Bringing young people before the court for minor offending risks entrenching them in the criminal justice system.” None of this is new to Julie Tongs, the chief executive of the ACT’s Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service, which does outreach in Canberra’s jail and runs drug counselling and support programs. She still remembers 40 years ago, when her children were targeted by police as they came home from school. “If there was a group of black kids and a group of white kids, or a mixture of both going home from school, they’d target the black group,” Tongs said. “They still do, and go through their backpacks and stuff like that.” Tongs says the disparity of treatment is not isolated to policing. It’s also replicated in the courts, she says. “All this stuff that’s been happening overseas, we’re a fairly placid mob, compared to over there,” Tongs said. “But we’ve got a lot of very angry young people and there will be an uprising. I really believe there will be a riot at this jail any day because of the racism.” Despite the ramifications of over-policing, there remains a paucity of data, publicly at least. Most police forces do not release detailed breakdowns of their interactions with Indigenous Australians, NSW being a notable exception. In Victoria, despite a commitment to begin mandatory recording of ethnic appearance descriptors in police interactions with the public, the force has refused to make the data public. In a statement this week, Victoria police told the Guardian there was “considerable community concern and risk associated with the reporting of ethnicity data”. “Victoria police has in the past consulted with community representatives around the topic of ethnicity data collection,” a spokesperson said. “Some supported the collation of ethnicity data, while others cautioned it could lead to community harm.” Researchers like Anthony have had to fight for information, or otherwise rely on media reporting, like the Guardian Australia’s Deaths Inside project, a count of Indigenous deaths in custody. “I think it’s conscious, the withholding of data, because the police collect it but they don’t want that oversight. “They don’t want that interrogation by the public, because it makes them accountable. “So I don’t think it’s an accident or negligence, I actually think there’s a deliberate withholding of data.” Walsh has also had enormous difficulty accessing police data. She said academics were asked to sign deeds around how they would use the information before it was released, and that it was virtually impossible for the public to navigate the system. “You do get to the point where you come to the conclusion that it’s deliberate, that this is essentially a cover up,” she told Guardian Australia. with Josh Taylor",AUS,aboriginal,1,3,1,2
5189,https://www.insider.com/australia-blm-protests-spotlight-indigenous-deaths-in-police-custody-2020-6,Australia BLM Protests Spotlight Indigenous Deaths in Police Custody,"Anger over the police-related deaths of George Floyd and other people of color has translated into protests around the world, including Australia. On Saturday, thousands marched across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide, in a united stance against police brutality and racism. Some held signs reading ""Indigenous lives matter"" or ""Same problem, different soil."" Ruby Wharton, who spearheaded the demonstration in Brisbane, said she wants Australians to see the connection between the Black Lives Matter movement in the US and the plight of Indigenous people in their own country. ""We are taking a step back and looking at the issue for what it really is,"" Wharton, a coordinator for Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, told Insider. ""That black people had to die in order for communities across the world to come together."" Wharton was one of dozens of at a vigil Wednesday in Musgrave Park, where the words ""I can't breathe"" were spelled out in 433 candles, symbolizing the 432 Indigenous Australians reported to have died in custody since 1991. The 433rd candle, Wharton said, was for George Floyd.  The images of unrest coming from the United States have given Australians an opportunity to reflect on police brutality against the Aboriginal community, activists say, and have reignited the debate on why it hasn't received a similar reckoning. ""There's so many modern parallels with what's going on in Australia and the United States,"" Sudanese-Australian activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied told CNN. ​""It's the same institutionalized racism, it's the same black deaths in custody and police getting away with it with impunity."" In November 2015, David Dungay, a 26-year-old member of the Dunghutti people, died while in a Sydney prison hospital. Officials stormed his cell after Dungay, who was schizophrenic and diabetic, refused to stop eating a bag of cookies. They dragged him into an observation room, where at least four guards held him facedown. Echoing George Floyd's plea, Dungay said ""I can't breathe"" 12 times before losing consciousness and dying. But, unlike Floyd, his death was not followed by nationwide protests. In 1991, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody determined 99 Indigenous people had died in custody between 1980 and 1989. It made hundreds of recommendations for preventing loss of life —including improved access to records, better medical assistance, an end to racist language against Aboriginal people, and incarceration only being used as a last resort. But few of the suggestions have been implemented in the past three decades. In that same timeframe, no officer has been convicted of killing an Indigenous person in custody. In 2004, a coroner in Townsville, Queensland, determined that an officer had caused the death of an Indigenous man found dead in his cell. She testified Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley punched David Doomadgee in the jaw and continued to pummel him on the ground, according to the BBC. No attempt was made to resuscitate Doomadgee or later investigate his death. Queensland Police Union president Gary Wilkinson dismissed the coroner's testimony, insisting it came from ""unreliable evidence from a drunk,"" the BBC reported. A jury acquit Hurley on manslaughter and assault charges in less than four hours, the Australia Broadcasting Corporation reported. Doomadgee's death was followed by rioting on Palm Island, where he lived. Hurley's home and the Townsville courthouse and police station were burned down. In response, 80 riot police in ski masks were flown in, armed with guns and tasers. They barged into residents' homes and arrested more than two dozen. In 2016, the raid was found to be in violation of the Racial Discrimination Act. For David Dungay's nephew, Paul Francis-Silva, it's hard not to compare what happened to his uncle to the tragedy of George Floyd. And hard not to feel like more needs be done. ""We really do feel for the family over in the US, because we do know how it feels to actually watch a video clip of a loved one being suffocated to death,"" he told The Guardian. ""We need to be just as outraged with what's going on in our own backyard."" Though only about 2% of Australians identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, Indigenous adults are 15 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous Australians, according to a 2018 report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That same year, the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare reported that Indigenous juveniles were 26 times more likely to be in detention than their non-Indigenous peers. The issue of police violence returned to the fore on Monday, when a video surfaced online of an unnamed Sydney constable slamming an Indigenous teen face-first into a brick sidewalk after the youth told the officer he would ""crack you across the jaw, bro."" While the clip sparked outrage — and led to the constable being put on restricted duty — New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the officer ""had a bad day"" and shouldn't be fired ""after making such a commitment to the community."" NSW police minister David Elliott also defended the constable, saying he was ""horrified"" by the teen's language. Young people, he added, need to learn ""there are levels of authority there that really command respect."" But New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters the video showed ""we still have a long way to go in our country."" ""I think what's happened in the US is a good wake-up call for all of us,"" she said. ""All of our hearts are breaking as to what's happening in the United States, and we certainly have to ensure that we do what we can in our own country to protect all of our citizens."" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday asked people to avoid the rallies over public health concerns. Then the New South Wales Supreme Court ruled the Sydney gathering was in violation of current coronavirus restrictions. Protesters won an appeal just hours before the event was slated to begin. Many had vowed to go forward regardless of whether the demonstration was legally sanctioned or not. ""Black lives matter and we are not going to stop, we are going to march,"" David Dungay's mother, Leetona, told SBS News on Friday. ""We don't care what an act of law says, because those acts of law are killing us,"" she said. ""I'm marching for my son, and nothing is stopping me.""  Keep reading",AUS,aboriginal,1,3,1,3
5195,https://nit.com.au/australians-angrier-about-racism-in-america-than-racism-in-australia/,Australians angrier about racism in America than racism in Australia - National Indigenous Times,"Please note this story contains reference to people who have died. Moral outrage is an interesting thing. I’ve seen plenty of posts, reposts, stories, and comments on social media about the atrocity that was the George Floyd murder and the continued systemic racism that’s ever-present in the United States. It has become obvious that many are simply brushing over the problems in our own backyard. It has become obvious that many have forgotten or simply chosen to ignore the same last words of Dunghutti man, David Dungay Jr, as he was held down and sedated by prison guards: “I can’t breathe.” It has become obvious Australia likes to assume moral superiority when it comes to race, despite the fact that First Nations outcomes are disgraceful in this country. Our own Prime Minister chose to ignore the systemic issues I’m sure he knows remain prevalent across the country, saying on live radio on Monday he thought to himself, “how wonderful a country is Australia?” when thinking of the widespread protests across the States right now. “But when I see things like [what’s happening in the US], I’m just very thankful for the wonderful country we live in,” he said. How embarrassing that Scott Morrison thought it appropriate to pretend Australia is a utopia of equality. Such blatant feigning of ignorance is the height of poor leadership. Australia is wonderful, Australia is ‘the lucky country’—but only for some. It remains undeniable that Australia has a sinister past of colonial massacre fed by deep roots of white supremacism. It remains evident in our incarceration rates, our suicide rates, our health equity rates. First Nations Peoples are monstrously overrepresented in these areas despite making up approximately three percent of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics tells us that at June 30, 2019, over a quarter (28 percent) of the prison population were First Nations. The latest youth justice report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) found half the children aged 10-17 under youth supervision were First Nations, despite making up only six percent of that age group nationally. Since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its 339 recommendations in 1991, 432 First Nations people have died in custody. One third of these recommendations have still not been implemented and no police officer has ever been convicted of a black death in custody. Yet Scott Morrison is “thankful” for his country. He’s not thankful for Australia, he’s thankful he’s white. “The clear fact is that there are and there have been recent Aboriginal deaths in custody, and that’s a serious issue,” said Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, to NIT on Monday. “Clearly the recent death in America has tapped into something much deeper.” And she’s right. Australia and the United States share the same racist foundation that built up the countries to what they are today. It’s a vicious undercurrent that routinely flares up around January 26, Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC Week in Australia. It was only weeks ago a Nine News report returned to the paternalistic thinking of the past by producing a story on what Palm Island residents were spending their compensation money on from the 2004 Palm Island riots over the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee. This was money that was received after a court found the excessive force used by Queensland Police during the riots was racially motivated. Nine reported the story as if First Nations individuals don’t have the same agency to choose where, what and who they spend their money on as non-First Nations individuals. It’s this kind of racist undercurrent that is present everywhere in Australia and the US. In the US, it flares up every time a police officer blatantly murders an African American. It flares up every February: Black History Month. And it flares up every time the current President opens his mouth to incite violence—“when the looting starts, the shooting starts”. I wonder if it’s the distance between Australia and the United States that makes it easier for people to be outraged from afar instead of fighting against something so real and so close to home. The distance allows us to show our superficial support to Black America’s plight while remaining complacent and complicit to the human rights injustices occurring daily in our own communities. The further removed you are from a situation, the easier it becomes to insert your opinion without having to remember these are real people and real lives being affected. So, while Australians get angry about America from a distance, Australia’s First Peoples are still dying too early, still surviving systemic persecution, and still living in a country where easily fixed inequalities are rampant.

5226,https://news.defence.gov.au/people/indigenous-soldier-sets-example,Indigenous soldier sets an example,"Private Zion Connors, from Inverell, near Coffs Harbour, is spending National Reconciliation Week far from home in the Middle East region. He is serving on Operation Accordion as a unit storeman. As part of the Theatre Communications Group (TCG-10) Rotation 10, Private Connors provides logistics support to other operations throughout Middle East. He said he felt honoured to be able to share his culture and heritage with other deployed Defence Force personnel during National Reconciliation Week. “I am a proud Koori Gumbayngirr man. I am also related to people from the Dunghutti, Gamilaraay (Kamilaroi) and Awabakal tribes,” Private Connors said. “My culture is important to me because I know I’m part of a rich culture and heritage. “No matter where I go, even here in the Middle East, I’ll always see an uncle or aunty, brother or sister and sit down and have a cuppa and yarn. “We don’t have to be directly related but that shows how close a lot of us are and I think that’s amazing.” On May 27, a National Reconciliation Week ceremony was held at Australia’s main operating base in the Middle East. “National Reconciliation Week for me means to learn about our shared cultures, histories and achievements, and to explore how each of us can contribute to achieving reconciliation for all Australians,” Private Connors said. He joined the Army for a career and to inspire his younger brothers. “It was so inspiring to see the service men and women at the military information sessions at school. The way they spoke about their job, the way they held themselves to a high standard, and their uniforms were pretty cool too,” Private Connors said. “I also wanted to be a role model for my three younger brothers because our two eldest brothers weren’t around for us. I needed them to know anything is possible - you just have to want it. “It makes me feel proud to come home and hear mates and family say, ‘Wow, you’ve changed in such a short time’.

Here are five indigenous weapon systems that can help India in the event of an armed conflict. With the skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on 15 June, what looked like a usual standoff in eastern Ladakh a month and a half back has now become the most serious military crisis between the two countries in over three decades. The last time the two countries came this close to an armed conflict was 1986-87, in Sumdorong Chu Valley in the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh, and General K Sundarji was the army chief. While an armed conflict does not look imminent, one can’t be ruled out if China refuses to pack up and move back from the new areas it has occupied. In this context, here are five indigenous weapon systems, which can help India address the gaps in its military capabilities vis-a-vis the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). 1) Light Combat Helicopter Light combat helicopter (LCH) is a dedicated light helicopter for combat operations built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The helicopter, which has a narrow fuselage configuration, is equipped with “stealth features, Armour protection, Night attack capability and crash worthy landing gear for better survivability”. According to Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, the only helicopter pilot to become Chief of Air Staff, “During the Kargil War of 1999, there was a need felt for armed attack helicopters capable of operating at high altitude. That’s where the LCH fits in.” “It has successfully been tested in altitudes over 13,000 feet and was the first attack helicopter to land at the forward landing base in Siachen,” he writes. The government had in November 2016 cleared the acquisition of 15 of these helos. However, no deal has been signed yet. The HAL, its maker, expects the deal to be signed this year. It has began production of five new airframes with plans to deliver ahead of time when a final deal is in place. While the initial clearance is for 15 helos, HAL expects the total number to go up to 165. 2) Netra AEW&C When fighters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were flying towards Balakot to hit terror camps in Pakistan, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were in air guiding them and keeping a close watch over movements in Pakistani airspace. The aircraft, often called India’s “eye in the sky” by defence enthusiasts, ""provides 240-degree coverage and surveillance ranges between 250km and 375km"". India, currently, has only two of these aircraft. While the first platform was inducted in 2017, the second was formally handed over to the IAF in September 2019. Experts have said that two Netra AEW&C platforms are not enough even for the Pakistan front, let along keeping an eye on movements along both northern and eastern frontier. While India’s AEW&C fleet is very small in comparison to China’s even Pakistan operates a larger fleet with six Saab 2000-based Erieye AEW&Cs. 3) Light Utility Helicopter India needs a replacement to Cheetahs and Chetaks helos in its fleet of utility aircraft. With India-Russia joint venture to manufacture the Kamov Ka-226T light helicopter delayed due to tricky negotiations between the two sides, the light utility helicopter (LUH) of HAL can be inducted by the Indian Army. The aircraft underwent high-altitude trials at Ladakh’s Daulat Beg Oldi in September 2019. In August this year, two prototypes of the LUH will head to the Siachen glacier to demonstrate its capabilities to the Indian Army. The army plans to induct 126 LUHs. According to Livefist, “The LUH achieved initial operational clearance (IOC) in February, with FOC planned for next year, by which time paperwork on inductions will have begun”. 4) Dhanush Howitzers Dhanush, a 155 mm towed artillery gun, is the first indigenous artillery gun of this calibre. The Indian Army has ordered 114 Dhanush Howitzers and the first few guns have already been handed over to it by the Jabalpur-based Gun Carriage Factory. In view of tensions with China, the army can speed up the induction of these guns for use along the China border. Dhanush guns can add to the firepower of the M777 ultra-light howitzers inducted by the army for use in mountainous terrain. The gun, an improved version of the design and technology supplied by Bofors in the 1980s, underwent trials in cold and high-altitude conditions in Leh and Sikkim. 5) Guided Pinaka During the Kargil War, Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launch system was used to target Pakistani positions. An improved version of Pinaka, called Pinaka MK-II or guided Pinaka, can improve India’s firepower along the China border. Using guided Pinaka, which has a new navigation, control and guidance system, the Indian Army can target Chinese positions with improved accuracy. The extended range version of the rocket used in this system has hit targets at a range of 90 km during trials at a test range off the coast of Odisha in December 2019. VIDEO: Guided Pinaka in its third test today at the Pokhran ranges. pic.twitter.com/H0SqFsry9G One Pinaka launcher has 12 rockets which can be fired in 44 seconds. Each Pinaka rocket delivers 100 kilograms of high explosive on the target. This means that around 7.2 tonnes of high explosive is delivered on the target in 44 seconds. An Appeal...

Indigenous lives depend on it | Tom Calma and Mick Gooda,"National cabinet meets on Friday to discuss targets, but it’s also crucial to address the underlying drivers of offending and imprisonment A common thread has been running through the beginning of 2020: the need for community strength and resilience. When the devastating bushfire season made thousands of people homeless, everyday Australians reached out to support those in need, donating money, food, clothing and time. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, people came together and did the tough task of staying home to protect our most vulnerable. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities demonstrated leadership and resilience, in some cases acting swiftly to close their communities before governments had acted to do so. Following the killing of George Floyd in the United States, we saw Australians again come together in a different way – on the streets, and online – in a strong demonstration of anger over the deaths of black men and women in Australian prisons and police custody, and the systemic racism and disadvantage at the heart of our system. Australia’s First Nations communities know a lot about resilience – a resilience fired in the forge of dispossession, disempowerment and discrimination, a resilience that has sustained their advocacy and calls for change in the face of the government’s continued inaction. We first proposed targets to reduce incarceration back in 2006. It wasn’t until 2018 that Coag announced it would consider draft incarceration targets as part of the Closing the Gap “refresh” and now, 14 years after we first called for them, there is a draft plan to include very modest targets, to be discussed at national cabinet on Friday. Our governments now need to be serious about this issue. Any targets should be ambitious, and the effort sustained. Lives depend on it. To meet these targets we need coordinated legislative and policy reforms and a commitment to shifting power and resources. The 2017 Australian Law Reform Commission’s Pathways to Justice report delivered a blueprint for these reforms, to be underpinned by a justice reinvestment approach. More than three years later, with the exception of the ACT, governments have again failed to act. The levers of change need to go beyond the criminal justice system. It is crucial to address the underlying drivers of offending and incarceration, including intergenerational trauma, poverty and inadequate access to essential services such as housing, health and education. This path towards a just justice system is what we all want – where we live in resilient and caring communities and young people can lead full lives. We all have a role to play in recognising the racism and other forms of discrimination embedded in our systems and then take action to challenge and dismantle them. The problems extend beyond the police and criminal justice system and into other areas such as health, housing and education. School discipline policies result in disproportionately high numbers of First Nations children being excluded from their education. This pushes them out towards contact with police and the criminal justice system, and a punitive policing model that results in far too many Aboriginal children and young people being locked up. While we wait for governments to act, First Nations communities are stepping in to the void to create futures for their kids, working tirelessly to build safe and strong communities. They are working to shift the conditions that have seen too many of their children and young people get caught up in the criminal justice system. The Murri School in Brisbane is an Indigenous-owned and controlled independent school widely recognised for its success. Established in 1986, it currently educates over 270 students, 95% of whom are Indigenous. The school delivers a wholistic suite of programs centred on the education of their students, which includes a focus on their health, comprehensive family support and “at school” meals to address those underlying issues that generally impact negatively on education outcomes. It is a community-led solution delivering results for our young people. In 2013, the town of Bourke in New South Wales became the first major site in Australia to implement community-led justice reinvestment. Maranguka is driving change toward their community agenda Growing our Kids up Safe, Smart and Strong. An impact assessment by KPMG reported outcomes including a 23% reduction in police recorded rates of domestic violence, a 31% increase in Year 12 retention, and a 42% reduction in days spent in custody. With a focus on sustaining these outcomes, Maranguka is now working towards building a First Nations model of self-governance. We have long championed community-led justice reinvestment as the key to addressing the over-incarceration of First Nations people. This was echoed in the Australian Law Reform Commission’s Pathways to Justice report, which recommended support for other communities looking to work in a similar way to Bourke. It is becoming increasingly clear that in order to build strong and resilient communities, governments must invest in and support solutions that are led and owned by communities. This is true whether we are meeting environmental challenges such as bushfires, health challenges such as pandemics or social challenges such as community wellbeing. The Black Lives Matter protests have brought people together from across the spectrum of society, not only in frustration and anger but also to express solidarity and hope for a brighter future in which our children are safe to thrive. The way to unlock that future is through community-led solutions. Professor Tom Calma AO is from the Kungarakan and Iwaidja tribal groups. He is chancellor of the University of Canberra and co-chair of the senior advisory group of the Indigenous Voice co-design process (taking leave as co-chair of Reconciliation Australia).

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago Western Australia has recorded a third Aboriginal death in custody within two months after an inmate died in Roebourne Regional Prison on Wednesday morning. In a statement, the Department of Justice said the 47-year-old man had been found unconscious by prison officers in his six-person dormitory cell. The health centre at Roebourne Regional Prison.Credit:OICS But despite efforts by medical staff and paramedics, the man could not be revived. His death comes less than three weeks after a 19-year-old man died by suicide five months into his jail term at Acacia Prison, in Wooroloo, an hour east of Perth. Stanley, whose surname WAtoday has chosen not to publish at the request of his family, had been struggling with mental health in the lead up to his death, raising concerns among his loved ones that his calls for help had gone unanswered. The 19-year-old, described by his family as a budding Aboriginal artist and caring uncle, was sentenced in Fremantle Magistrates Court to two years jail for burglary-related offences committed in February. With parole, he could have been released in six months. Stanley's death follows an incident at the same jail a month earlier, where a 40-year-old Aboriginal man died after collapsing at the privately owned prison. His death was deemed not suspicious. At the same time, thousands gathered across Australia to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and call for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. The Department of Justice said the death at Roebourne Prison did not appear to be suspicious but it would be subject to a department review and a Coroner's inquest. ""Corrective Services Commissioner Tony Hassall has extended his condolences to the man’s family and is travelling to Roebourne today,"" a department spokesman said. ""Support will be offered to the family of the prisoner and other prisoners at the site. ""In responding to this Indigenous death in custody, the department will seek cultural advice from community elders."" Since the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, 236 people have died in WA. Of those, 84 have been ruled unnatural – mostly suicides – and 48 are still pending a coronial inquest. Curtin University senior Indigenous research fellow Dr Hannah McGlade said the high rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody in WA required urgent political attention. ""It is extremely disappointing that neither the state or federal governments are responding to this crisis,"" she said. ""Australia has signed the Optional Protocol on the Convention Against Torture but the monitoring mechanisms that do exist, are known to be ineffective. ""The Office of the Inspector of Custodial Services condemned the state of Roebourne Prison only recently for its appalling conditions, but has the Corrections Minister responded?"" Roebourne Prison made headlines earlier this year after a report by a custodial services inspector described the cells as being infested with rats and snakes. It also said high temperatures inside the prison, reaching up to 33 degrees celsius at night, posed a threat to the health and safety of inmates. The report came three years after the OICS found the Pilbara jail was decrepit, with intolerable and inhumane living conditions caused by the extreme heat. ""It is very clear that the monitoring mechanisms need to be culturally appropriate and they are not, so Aboriginal people understandably have a lack of confidence in OICS,"" Dr McGlade said. ""Aboriginal people are dying in prisons in WA in this way for a reason, and the state cannot continue to avoid and neglect its duty to the lives of Aboriginal prisoners.""

From the University of Melbourne, Dr Bennett’s research focuses on creative ways to recover Indigenous languages by partnering with Yuin communities on the NSW south coast to explore song composition, notation and arrangements in culturally appropriate practices. A Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Wurrung musician and researcher, Dr Bennett grew up in Echuca Victoria and moved to Melbourne in her late teens. She began her studies at Deakin University before studying her Masters and PhD at RMIT University. She also pursued a career as a musician as part of musical trio, Tiddas. Dr Bennett’s relationship with language began in her early life. “In Echuca High School, there weren’t many of us little Koorie kids … I remember one of our electives was learning a language. We had the choice of three, French, Italian and Japanese. It used to really bother me that I couldn’t learn my own language in a school setting,” Dr Bennett said. “Why aren’t we learning Yorta Yorta on Yorta Yorta Country? That always has stuck with me. I’ve always wanted to speak my language.” In the early 1990s, Dr Bennett was gifted a cassette of her great-great grandmother singing in language. “For years I was told that our language died. This was drummed into us growing up, not from our families but from society. And I gave up in a lot of ways … until I heard this tape,” she said. “And it hit me. Our culture is not dead, our language, our rituals, our ceremonies, our connection to Country. It was a profound moment.” With her research focusing on language, Dr Bennett has a keen interest in the power of song and singing. “Something wonderful happens to our spirit and body … when we sing. Even when we don’t think we have a good voice, it makes us feel alive. It brings us to a present moment and not much else, I think, can,” she said. Through her research, Dr Bennett has investigated linguistic records, including those of collector R.H. Matthews. “I was completely disconnected from what was on the page, and it made me so depressed. I thought, I don’t know my own culture, this whitefella knows my language better than I do,” said Dr Bennett. “But the more I engaged, the more my confidence grew around who I was as a person and I realised that these old fellas had no idea what was going on. They may have gotten down some words, but they missed what is fundamentally born into Aboriginal people. And that is our knowledge.” “I always said the best job I ever had was Tiddas, but this is something so profound. I wake up every day and I look forward to working.” Dr Bennett, Associate Professor Alice Motion and Dr Yu Heng Lau are the 2020 Westpac Research Fellows. The Fellowship program was created by the Westpac Scholars Trust in collaboration with the University of Sydney and the University of Melbourne. Each fellow receives $500,000 over the next three years to cover their salary and research costs, as well as leadership development opportunities. “This Fellowship program is designed to support outstanding early-career researchers across a diverse range of fields who share a common goal, to help Australia prosper and grow,” said Susan Bannigan, CEO of Westpac Scholars Trust. “Alice, Yu Heng and Lou are all working on such different, yet extraordinary research projects that we believe will have a lasting impact in years to come.” By Rachael Knowles National Indigenous Times (NIT) strives to be the most comprehensive Indigenous online news site in Australia by offering rigorous reporting on the issues that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

During his first six months of rounding up camels, Warwick Hill got absolutely pummelled. He is now a confident camel dairy farmer on South Australia's Limestone Coast, but 30 years ago camels were a foreign concept to him when he first started mustering the wild animals. ""We just wasted our time and got injured and thrown off camels and lost them and caught them again,"" Mr Hill said. The adventure started in the 1980s, when a 19-year-old Mr Hill travelled to the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yunkunytjatjara Lands (APY) in the remote north-west of SA to hunt rabbits, only to find they had been decimated by the calicivirus. Without any rabbits around, his best friend and elder, Roger Kayipipi, asked if he wanted to try catching camels. On their first go they rounded-up a couple of big bulls using lassos and a four-wheel drive. ""That was the stupidest kind of thing to bring back and try and break-in,"" Mr Hill said. It was not until an expert camel handler came out to do some mustering in the lands that Mr Hill and Mr Kayipipi worked out how to break-in the wild animals using traditional tracking techniques. ""If you can stay on the track, you can find the camel,"" Mr Hill said. ""I learnt eventually to do it — nowhere near as good as what they can."" They learnt how to keep the camels as calm as possible by keeping the four-wheel drives and motorbikes at a distance. ""We'd have to bring them in as quickly as we could without riding them hard because they overheat and then react … you can't get them into the yards,"" Mr Hill said. Thirty years later, Mr Hill has been running a camel dairy 2,173 kilometres from where he learnt to catch them. He is now preparing to return to the APY Lands to muster a further 1,000 camels for an emerging camel dairy in Victoria, but it will not be an easy task. ""To find a good milking camel you're only looking at a very small percentage,"" Mr Hill said. ""Between three to five per cent of all the camels that you can catch will actually be worthwhile."" Mr Hill spent 11 years living and learning from Aboriginal elders in the heart of Australia. A rabbit shooter from Western Australia, he was sent to the APY Lands by his boss, a rabbit buyer and railway ganger in Kulgera, Northern Territory. Mr Hill went without knowing he was entering Aboriginal territory and said permits ""weren't really required back then"". He went on to live in the community and sell rabbits directly to the locals. It was around then that he made the decision to learn the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara languages. ""I was out there on my own, so I felt like I wanted to participate with the community at large,"" Mr Hill said. Bringing rabbits to the communities as a primary hunter gained him respect. ""That really got me in good stead and trusted, and just learning lots of firsthand stories and experiences, which I just loved, it was great,"" Mr Hill said. The elder who adopted him, Mr Kayipipi, passed away a few years ago. ""Nearly all of the elders that I was very good friends with all those years ago have now passed away, which is very unfortunate."" After leaving Central Australia Mr Hill went travelling. He was salvaging a sunken pirate ship in Timor-Leste when he met his wife, TJ, a filmmaker. ""We just hit it off. We sailed around for the next eight years,"" he said. They travelled the world working on expensive yachts to fund their wanderlust. In 2014 the pair were back in SA for what was meant to be a short stint. ""I took TJ back out to the APY Lands to meet up with the elders and we just got wrangled into camel mustering again,"" Mr Hill said. Camel milk was gaining momentum in Australia and they decided to take the plunge and start a business. In 2015 they started Humpalicious with 70 camels at SA's Port Germein on the Spender Gulf. But after three years getting the business up and running their landlord upped the rent and operations were no longer viable. With a bit of help from Mr Hill's father they bought 40 hectares at Robe, on SA's Limestone Coast. They have had one summer in their new home with their 50 camels, all individually named. ""It's been tough, it's been slow, but it's now getting there,"" Ms Hill said. ""It's a brand new industry so we've had to build not only the profile for the milk but also our brand name, our business… all of it, it didn't exist before."" With minimal lactose and a similar level of protein to cow milk, Mr Hill does not understand why the camel product is not as accepted but he is undaunted. ""Starting a new industry where it hasn't been proven, it's not all laid out… that's not for everybody,"" Mr Hill said. ""I like that challenge."" From the camels that are born at the farm only a quarter of them will likely produce milk. ""They're either a good milker or they're not,"" Mr Hill said. Back in the APY Lands, the young men Mr Hill taught to muster camels are continuing the practice. ""Those guys are now continuing to manage, and muster, and handle the camel business out in Central Australia, which is fantastic,"" he said. Despite travelling all over the world several times, Mr Hill's love for Australia's open land and the camels that roam it ring the loudest. ""I think if I'd been born 200 years ago I would have been out in the middle of Australia, probably on the back of a camel getting lost somewhere.""

In the remote bush of northeastern Australia, it's a way of life that dates back thousands of years. Long before European colonizers settled in Australia, Aboriginal groups have been setting their own lands ablaze as a fire management technique. They use carefully controlled low flames and the power of the wind to clear grasses and kindling, the materials that fuel more unpredictable blazes during fire season. Many Indigenous people see their techniques as part of a solution for devastating blazes like the ones that ravaged Australia from September to March. The fires, which peaked in December and January, burnt 46 million acres of land and destroyed nearly 6,000 buildings. In the state of Queensland, the Indigenous organization Firesticks hosts workshops for people from across the country to spread knowledge of the ancient technique. ""Western knowledge of fire is that they're afraid of it,"" Kylee Clubb, a fire practitioner from Queensland, told Business Insider Weekly. ""Whereas traditional burning and Aboriginal knowledge is that we work with it."" Business Insider Weekly traveled to Queensland in 2019 to speak with three Indigenous fire practitioners and witness the traditional burning many believe could help Australia during future fire seasons.

This year’s overall winner is Wangkajunga–Walmajarri artist Ngarralja Tommy May, who won the major $50,000 prize for an intricate and technically stunning etching on tin called Wirrkanja, described by the judging panel as “triumphant” with “exquisite beauty and power”. “I feel proud,” Ngarralja Tommy May said on video link, from his home in Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. His artistic career spans more than three decades. “I’ve been trying all my life [to win]. All the time second, fourth, last, sometimes nothing. But I got it now, today. “My time this year, I’m the winner. At last.” Wirrkanja depicts a clay pan and waterhole on his country on the Canning Stock Route during heavy rains. “It’s the country where I lost my brother, its jilji [sand dune] country and flat country. Theres a jila [waterhole] there . It’s not far from Kurtal, over two sand dunes. It’s in flood time, the water runs down the jilji,” he said. “This is my country and my family’s country. This is my job; it’s a good job.” Warlpiri artist Adrian Jangala Robertson won the general painting award with Yalpirakinu, a work about the desert mountains, ridges and trees that are part of his mother’s country. The bark painting award was won by Yolŋu Matha artist Marrnyula Mununggurr for Muṉguymirri (In Small Pieces), a sacred design for the freshwaters of the Djapu clan at their homeland of Waṉḏawuy in eastern Arnhem Land. The Wandjuk Marika 3D award was won by Larrakia artist Jenna Lee. For her work HIStory Vessels, she carefully reworked the pages and coverboard of the Ladybird history book The Story of Captain Cook into a series of exquisite baskets and coolamons. “My work is about the power of storytelling and the beauty that can come when First Nations people are in control of our own stories and how those stories are told,” Lee said. “I love the ability to make sure that people like myself feel included in the visual national identity of Australia and I really hope that my art is open and welcoming enough it can shift perspectives and ultimately change opinions.” Amata-based Pitjantjatjara painter, Iluwanti Ken won the works on paper award for Walawulu Ngunytju Kukaku Ananyi (Mother Eagles Going Hunting). Ken said the eagles are like Anangu mothers: they hunt to find food to feed their children and protect their babies from outside dangers. The Natsiaa judging panel – of Karen Mills, Stephen Williamson and Donna Nadjamerrek – described Ken’s piece as a “dramatic yet sensitive” work which “beautifully demonstrates the freedom and confidence of the artist”. The emerging artist award was won by Cecilia Umbagai from Mowanjum in Western Australia. “I’ve been painting all my life, learning from the elders, sitting with them while they worked, listening,” Umbagai said. And one of the youngest-ever winners, 18-year-old Siena Mayutu Wurmarri Stubbs won the multimedia award for a short film called Shinkansen, which she made while travelling through Japan on a bullet train from Nagoya to Kyoto in the days after her beloved grandmother’s death in 2019. The judges said her work was “sensitive and authentic and completely captivating … a thoughtful and thought-provoking work that intrigues and amazes with its perspective and humility”. In a year described by Telstra CEO Andrew Penn as “far from normal”, the exhibition this time is virtual. It can be viewed at natsiaa.com.au.",AUS,aboriginal,0,0,0,0

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago Last year it was ABC journalist and author Leigh Sales who copped it at Perth's Disrupted Festival of Ideas, this year conservative Alice Springs politician Jacinta Price seems likely to be on the receiving end of the controversy. WA's State Library has confirmed Ms Price has been booked as a keynote speaker for this year's event, and acknowledged her involvement might upset local Noongar people. Jacinta Price is a Warlpiri/Celtic woman who grew up in Alice Springs.Credit:Facebook But State Librarian Margaret Allen backed the move to invite Ms Price, saying the Disrupted Festival was about debate and exchange of ideas, not about everyone agreeing. Ms Price is an outspoken Aboriginal conservative, an Alice Springs councillor and the director of the Indigenous program at the Centre for Independent Studies, a libertarian think tank. She is the daughter of former NT minister Bess Price and a controversial figure for many Aboriginal Australians for her views on domestic violence and child protection in Indigenous communities. ""Yes, we are aware that Jacinta Price is potentially disruptive but that is exactly why we have chosen to invite her to this festival,"" Ms Allen said. ""The State Library does not believe in censorship or that Ms Price has crossed a line, which means her views should not be aired or given a platform. ""We acknowledge that the local Noongar community does not share this view."" This is not the first time Ms Price has faced controversy ahead of a scheduled public speaking event. In September 2019, NSW traditional owners called for Ms Price's Mind the Gap Tour event in Coffs Harbour to be cancelled, saying the Alice Springs councillor was ""not welcome"". In a statement a group made up of nine local Aboriginal organisations said Ms Price had vilified Aboriginal peoples and cultures for years and ridiculed their ""compounding pain and suffering"". Ms Price fired back at critics, saying the group's move was ""political correctness gone absolutely bonkers"" and adding she would not request permission from elders to enter Australian land. Ms Allen said journalist Stan Grant would be another keynote speaker at this year's event, who would likely ""provide a different opinion to Jacinta Price"". ""We will also invite members of the local Noongar community to join Jacinta on a panel to discuss her ideas,"" she said. ""Libraries best serve their communities when they openly and freely support citizens in accessing and understanding information of different kinds, even when this information may include views that are considered controversial."" Ms Allen said while Ms Price had accepted the invitation to speak at the festival she was unlikely to attend due to COVID-19 restrictions limiting interstate travel to WA. Ms Price was contacted for comment. The free Disrupted Festival of Ideas will take place at the State Library of WA on November 7. This year's festival will be centred around the theme 'A Better World' and include activities for children, music performances and panel discussions. Copyright © 2022",AUS,aboriginal,1,1,0,0
7032,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/21/afl-slugged-with-retrospective-bill-for-use-of-aboriginal-flag-as-fans-urged-to-bring-their-own,AFL slugged with retrospective bill for use of Aboriginal flag as fans urged to bring their own,"Majority of leagues’ clubs have joined ‘free the flag’ campaign to petition government to help resolve issue with non-Indigenous licence-holders The AFL has been hit with a bill for its past use of the Aboriginal flag on merchandise produced during the Indigenous round, and this has been a factor in its decision not to enter into an agreement with the non-Indigenous owned company who have a worldwide exclusive licence to the flag. The admission comes as 16 of the AFL’s 18 clubs have signed on to support the “free the flag” campaign set up to petition the government to help resolve the issue. The flag’s designer, Luritja artist Harold Thomas gave a worldwide exclusive licence to a non-Indigenous owned company called Wam Clothing, which has been actively enforcing its rights since the agreement was announced in November 2018. The AFL’s Inclusion and social policy manager Tanya Hosch said that Wam Clothing has sought a “legal resolution” to the AFL’s past use of the flag on its merchandise, particularly club jumpers. “Typically in the past, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags have been printed on those jumpers,” Hosch said. “So WAM Clothing as part of the licence agreements, have asked for a legal resolution to the use of the flag on merchandise retrospectively, although I don’t know how far back.” Hosch spoke to Guardian Australia from Darwin on the eve of the Indigenous round game between Essendon and Richmond on Saturday, which will be played in honour of pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls. Hosch said the Indigenous round jumpers, which have been produced since 2012, had traditionally been sold to raise money for Indigenous programs. “So there is an outstanding issue there, in relation to the way the flag has been represented on our merchandise,” she said. “There is an agreement that any profit from the sale of those particular jumpers go into a fund to support Indigenous football programs. And those artists don’t get royalties on their artwork, knowing that the money goes into Aboriginal football programs.” The AFL decided not to engage with Wam Clothing based on advice it received from its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council, chaired by Paul Briggs. Earlier this year, the council advised the AFL not to enter into a licence agreement “in line with Aboriginal community sentiment about an official flag of our country,” Hosch said. Hosch said it was a really important emblem that has meaning for all Australians. “And to feel that now, the extra hurdles to jump through to actually make use of that in an appropriate way, to demonstrate community and cultural pride, it’s really bad, and to those people working hard behind the scenes to try and bring resolution to this issue for the good of the whole nation, I wish them well.” The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the issue is “extremely complicated” and his agency has been in “quiet discussions” about ways to resolve it. Wyatt told 6PR in Perth the government has the power to compulsorily acquire copyright, but he is reluctant to take that path. It could cost the government millions to buy out the copyright, he said. “I think someone put forward a figure of $25m based on the boxing kangaroo costing the Sydney Olympic Committee $13m at the time. But I suspect there are much more complex issues when you enter into licensing arrangements,” Wyatt said. “But I don’t want to go down a pathway where we legislate to take away the copyright of an individual, because we know that we can do it to anybody.” Wyatt told the ABC earlier this week that “it is unfortunate that some common sense has not prevailed.” In 2019 the minister ruled out the option of buying out the copyright after meeting with Harold Thomas. Guardian Australia understands discussions have been had with Thomas and Wam Clothing since then, without resolution. Wyatt is encouraging people who attend the weekend’s game to take their Aboriginal flag along and “carry it with pride”. Wam Clothing has previously issued “cease and desist” notices to several companies, including the AFL and Indigenous companies, and demanded payment for the use of the flag, even from charities. A campaign to “free the flag” has gathered momentum in the run-up to this weekend’s games, with 16 AFL clubs now expressing an interest in their players wearing T-shirts bearing #freetheflag slogans during training sessions and pre-match warmups. The campaign is backed by Olympic gold medallist and former senator Nova Peris and former Essendon player Michael Long, who said the situation was a “disgrace”. Laura Thompson, the managing director of Clothing the Gap who has been leading the Free the Flag campaign for the past 12 months, said she had faith in the power of sport to effect social change. “We really hope this is a tipping for the government to take action and do what’s right for Aboriginal people and for all Australia to have the same flag rights,” she said.

7391,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/canada-indigenous-consent-hawaii-telescope-1.5738068,Canadian astronomers contend with issue of Indigenous consent over Hawaiian telescope project | CBC News,"The Canadian astronomy community has named the controversial Thirty Meter Telescope its top facilities priority for the decade ahead while also recommending the creation of a policy focused on Indigenous consent in a section of its new long range planning document. The telescope, proposed for construction on Hawaii's tallest mountain, Mauna Kea, has sparked opposition and widespread protest from Kanaka Maoli, the Indigenous People of Hawaii. Canadian astronomers' commitment to the telescope has forced the community to contend with the tension between its scientific ambitions and how it navigates questions about Kanaka Maoli consent. They successfully lobbied the federal government to commit $254.5 million in funding toward the project in 2015. If built, TMT would be among the largest telescopes in the world. A fact-pack on the TMT website says the telescope will ""help answer fundamental questions about the universe"" will likely lead to discoveries that can't be anticipated today. Astrophysicist Sara Ellison, president of the Canadian Astronomical Society (CASCA), said ""it's not our decision to make"" when asked what role Canadian astronomers have to play in answering questions about Kanaka Maoli consent and TMT's future on Mauna Kea. CASCA is a professional body that represents astronomers in Canada and publishes a long range plan every 10 years. ""It is for the Native Hawaiians and the State of Hawaii to decide whether we're welcome. And if we're not, we won't go,"" said Ellison. Ellison said extreme efforts and good will went into the consultation process on TMT and said it had support from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a political body that represents Kanaka Maoli. The office voted to withdraw that support in 2015. Uahikea Maile, a Kanaka Maoli scholar and professor of Indigenous politics at the University of Toronto, said framing TMT as an internal Hawaiian matter is a way for Canadian astronomers to ""distance themselves from the kinds of ethical quandaries of dealing with humans and human populations."" ""When, in fact, in order to study the stars and the universe and other universes they have to contend with people on our own planet."" Maile has been advocating for Canadian divestment from the project and working to educate people about Kanaka Maoli perspectives about astronomy and Mauna Kea. Peaking at 4,200 metres above sea level, the dormant volcano is sacred to Kanaka Maoli. Its elevation and atmospheric conditions also present an ideal location for stargazing. Thirteen observatories have been built on the mountain since the 1960s. Maile said the TMT conflict is often framed as a clash between culture and science, but that it's really ""a territorial, jurisdiction issue"" — one that has arisen because of colonialism in Hawaii and the limited decision-making authority his people have on the mountain. Sara Ellison describes TMT as a ""lightning rod"" on Mauna Kea that's about more than any single project and that the conflict has made it a difficult time to be an astronomer. ""Some of us have been real targets of animosity… within our own university communities and further afield as well, that we are somehow to blame for police violence against Native Hawaiians,"" she said. She doesn't agree with the comparisons that have been drawn between the telescope and pipeline conflicts. ""With pipelines, businesses have something they really want to extract and have something to gain,"" she said. When it comes to astronomy, she sees her field as ""a gain for all of mankind."" ""We're all asking questions about our origins and I think there's actually quite a deep connection there with Native beliefs in terms of ways of learning about our past,"" she said. Maile said it's offensive to hear astronomers make a ""bizarre connection"" between their pursuit of knowledge and Kanaka Maoli culture. ""It is very clear to me that Canadian astronomers, after all my meetings, care more about finding alien life and discovering planets that are habitable for humans outside of our solar system than Indigenous rights and Indigenous Peoples on ours,"" he said. TMT's external relations vice-president Gordon Squires said in an emailed statement to CBC News that ""consent in Hawaii is a complex issue, as there is no single, recognized decision-making authority for the native Hawaiian population."" He wrote that TMT has gone through all the necessary processes and has met Hawaii's legal requirements to allow for construction and that ""there is significant support for the TMT Project, including among native Hawaiians."" Maile said there's a plurality of perspectives among Kanaka Maoli when it comes to TMT but that there's evidence to show that Kanaka Maoli don't consent to its construction. ""Evidence of no consent from my people would be for decades having opposition to ongoing industrialization of Mauna Kea and other mountains in Hawaii,"" he said. ""Kanaka Maoli say enough is enough and have shown up in force to say no,"" he said. In many ways, Mi'kmaw astronomer and University of Toronto professor Hilding Neilson straddles both sides of the conversation about TMT and Mauna Kea. He submitted white papers to CASCA to inform the long range plan, including one about astronomy on Mauna Kea that included recommendations about how Canadian astronomers can better support Indigenous rights. ""Most of the people in Canadian astronomy have very little insight or idea of what it means to be Indigenous or Indigenous issues in Canada or Hawaii,"" he said, though he said he finds it promising that many in his field are embracing the conversation about the ethics around facilities and Indigenous Peoples. Pauline Bramby, astronomer and co-chair of the panel that wrote the long range plan, said she hopes the section calling for the creation of a policy on Indigenous consent will prompt bigger conversations among astronomers, ""where we reflect on the kinds of privileges we have as astronomers and how those privileges are informed by the history of colonialism."" ""I think we've had a feeling in our field that because we don't build bombs and blow up people and everybody loves space that astronomy isn't a controversial field — it's kind of a blame-free field. And I think many of us are starting to realize that that's not quite the case."" She said TMT is a big part of why recommendations about Indigenous consent were written into the latest report but that a set of guiding principles would also be helpful for astronomers considering sites for ground-based facilities in other parts of the world. While the long range plan recommendations about Indigenous consent send the ""right message,"" Neilson worries that ""it's not clear who is responsible for implementing that spirit and that message. So it could also end up being all for naught."" When asked if there's something he could compel his astronomy colleagues to understand, he responded: ""We benefit from stolen land."" ""Every image, spectrum, beautiful telescope picture we got — taken from Hawaii — is based on stolen land. We might have permission to be on there by the State of Hawaii and various lease agreements, but at this point no Native Hawaiian community has ever given us that consent, as far as I know."" Construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope remains on hold. Mauna Kea remains the preferred site for construction, though a site in the Canary Islands has also been identified as a potential backup. Cost estimates to build the telescope are currently in the ballpark of $2.4 billion. The National Science Foundation is currently reviewing a funding proposal for the project.

Western Australia's Juukan Gorge has been home to a sacred site to local Indigenous peoples for over 46,000 years. In May of 2020, the site was destroyed in an explosion designed to expand a nearby iron ore mine. About the House: the official channel of the Australian House of Representatives The chief executive officer and two senior executives are being forced out of the mining giant Rio Tinto several months after investors started to revolt over the company’s destruction of an ancient aboriginal rock shelter, according to CNN. CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques will leave in March 2021, while two senior executives, Chris Salisbury, iron ore chief executive, and Simone Nieven, head of corporate relations who had the responsibility of handling relations with Indigenous communities, will leave at the end of 2020, according to Forbes. The 48-year-old chief executive is being forced out after investors listened to a continuing outcry from the Indigenous people of Australia who were horrified that Rio Tinto would trounce upon their sacred ground and blast away the ancient Juukan Gorge rock shelters, two culturally significant rock shelters in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Despite knowing the importance of the grounds to the the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, Rio Tinto blasted the site in order to mine a better quality of iron ore, according to The Guardian. The company’s board responded to the move by cutting executive pay and stripping the three executives of million in bonuses, but investors lined up to denounce that penalty as inadequate. “There were certainly some shareholders who felt strongly that the accountability was inappropriate and that this was an issue that needed to be addressed to rebuild trust,” said Rio Tinto Chairman Simon Thompson to The Sydney Morning Herald. “While there is general recognition of the transparency of the board review and support for the changes recommended, significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified,” the company said in a statement, as The Guardian reported. The wanton destruction of the site has shed light on the remarkable power the mining industry has over sacred, traditional lands. It has shown the need for greater legal guarantees to make sure heritage sites are protected. A spokesperson for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people told The Sydney Morning Herald, “Our focus continues to rest heavily on preserving Aboriginal heritage and advocating for wide-ranging changes to ensure a tragedy like this never happens again. We cannot and will not allow this type of devastation to occur ever again.” Among the prominent shareholders to express their misgivings were several large Australian investment funds and a group of 81 British pension funds. Also, the National Native Title Council in Australia said the board was divorced from reality in thinking that the pay cuts were somehow just punishment for destroying a 46,000-year-old site, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. “There is more work to be done,” said Jamie Lowe, chief executive for the National Native Title Council, as The Guardian reported. “The law needs to be strengthened. We can’t rely on the goodwill of mining companies, we need the law strengthened. We can’t rely on their word that things will get better.” “What happened at Juukan was wrong,” Thompson said Friday to The Sydney Morning Herald. “We are determined to ensure the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation.” Ian Silk, the chief executive of Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, said that he was “satisfied that appropriate responsibility has now been taken by executives at Rio Tinto,” according to The Guardian, “Rio can now work with traditional owners to guarantee that its processes are appropriate for the protection of culturally important sites and that it has the right internal accountabilities,” he added, as The Guardian reported. Additionally, the Australian Center for Corporate Responsibility applauded Friday’s announcement as an end to the “dishonest malaise of Rio Tinto’s board and senior management,” according to The Guardian. While the news of the executives departing is welcome, the institutional investors who have the clout to spur action within the company said the company would have to take steps to repair its relationship with Australia’s Indigenous people. “Rio Tinto now has the opportunity to address the necessary remediation, cultural heritage and risk processes with fresh eyes,” said Louise Davidson, chief executive of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which advises 38 large super funds on governance issues, to The Guardian. “Rio Tinto must prioritise working with traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people to rebuild their relationship. It is critical that this is not delayed,” she added.  Sign me up for the newsletter! The best of EcoWatch right in your inbox Sign up for our email newsletter!

The declaration by 20 national, state and territory-based organisations promises to “take significant action to break down the barriers that have prevented Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players, coaches, umpires and administrators from flourishing in the sport.” Among them is the Queensland Firebirds, whose explanation for benching Waka Waka woman Jemma Mi Mi for the Indigenous round - despite using her to promote the event, and Mi Mi being the only Indigenous player in any of Super Netball’s eight teams - prompted criticism from fans. Head Coach Roselee Jencke said the decision to leave Ms Mi Mi off the court was “strategic” in a statement that both revealed ""cultural awareness"" provided by Ms Mi MI to the team, and led to the amplification of former players' stories of racial discrimination within the sport. Among those detailing their negative experiences was former elite netballer Helena Saunders, the first Indigenous player for the Queensland Firebirds, who wrote an op-ed for online media platform IndigenousX. ""I don't actually want an apology, I want things to change,"" Ms Saunders later told NITV. Celeste Carnegie also spoke of her experiences in an op-ed for IndigenousX titled 'Racism ended my netball career before it even began.' There is racism across all forms of sport in Australia. Netball was never any different. I've experienced many incidences of racism within most teams I've been part of. — CC BANKS ⚡ (@celestecarnegie) June 10, 2020 “We acknowledge that netball hasn’t fully addressed the barriers that confront Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our system, and we apologise for this,” the declaration read, “We know it is unacceptable to have only one Aboriginal player within the Suncorp Super Netball league, but our challenge as a sport goes far beyond what happened to one player in a single game.” “Today, Netball Australia, Suncorp Super Netball, Member Organisations, SSN Clubs, the Australian Netball Players Association and the Confident Girls Foundation have committed to the change required in our pathways from grassroots to the Origin Diamonds – a change that will only be achieved in true partnership with netball’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.” Tuesday's announcement has been praised as ""a good step forward"". This is a good step forward - Netball Australia has not only said they are committed to understanding and then resolving under-representation of Mob at an elite level, but have released a plan detailing how they will do so. https://t.co/0TkGAIXzxd — Lidia Thorpe (@lidia__thorpe) September 29, 2020 The first step for the declaration commitment will focus on “understanding further the experiences of players, coaches, umpires and administrators in our system, identifying the barriers to greater Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation and creating sustainable change plans,” along with tracking and reporting on the changes made. The first report will come in October, showing the ‘State of the Game’ review findings. The development of “strategy framework” to make the promised changes will be lead by Marcia Ella-Duncan, Sharon Finnan-White, Stacey Campton, and Ali Tucker-Munro.   ",AUS,aboriginal,1,1,1,2

An Indigenous community leader in eastern Canada is renewing his call for concrete action from the federal government after a lobster pound in the province of Nova Scotia was destroyed overnight Saturday. In a statement shared by APTN News, Mike Sack, chief of Sipekne’katik First Nation, said the fire at the lobster pound in Middle West Pubnico, a small fishing village 270km (168 miles) west of Halifax, demonstrates “the need for greater police presence in the region”. Sack said the storage facility is “owned by a friend and ally of Sipekne’katik”. “This should never have happened and the people responsible should be brought to justice,” he said. “I am once again calling on Prime Minister [Justin] Trudeau and the RCMP (federal police force) to dedicate the necessary resources to this region to protect everyone.” This has gone TOO far. Fire crackling woke us up. Middle West Pubnico tonight 🥺 #MikMaq #TreatyRights pic.twitter.com/62M6l5B8o3 — Pierrette dEntremont (@PAdEntremont) October 17, 2020  Nova Scotia RCMP said it was investigating the fire as “suspicious”. “The fish plant incurred significant damage, it was not occupied at the time and no employees were injured, a man is in hospital with life-threatening injuries believed related to the fire,” the police said in a statement Saturday. Tense confrontations have taken place during the past several weeks between commercial and Indigenous fishers in Nova Scotia, who are exerting their right to fish outside Canada’s federally regulated fishing season. The Mi’kmaw people have a right under Canada’s constitution and treaties signed with the British Crown in the 1700s to fish in order to maintain a “moderate livelihood”. But while that right was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1999, the court never defined what a “moderate livelihood” means in practice. Sipekne’katik First Nation launched its own moderate livelihood fishery last month to be able to harvest outside of the season, prompting the ire of non-Indigenous commercial fishers in the province. Last week, a mob of hundreds of non-Indigenous fishers surrounded Indigenous fishers, APTN News reported. A van was set ablaze and hundreds of Indigenous fishers’ lobsters were destroyed in two separate incidents in the area. A man has been charged in relation to an assault on Chief Sack on October 14, the RCMP also said on Saturday. Police have been criticised for appearing to stand by during last week’s acts of violence against the Indigenous fishers, while Indigenous leaders across Canada have called on the Nova Scotia and federal governments to do more to ensure people are protected. Canada’s public safety minister, Bill Blair, said he was “confident the unacceptable acts of violence will be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators will be held to account”. “The threats, violence and intimidation have to stop. We all need to acknowledge that a lasting resolution to this dispute can only be concluded if it is rooted in the recognition of legitimate Mi’kmaw treaty rights,” Blair said in a statement.

The commission has recommended the government set up an Indigenous evaluation council, which would be “credible, useful, ethical and transparent” as part of a new government-wide evaluation strategy. “For decades there have been calls to better understand how policies and programs are affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But the reality is that evidence about what works and why remains thin,” the report said. “And while policy makers agree that evidence is critical for good policies, many admit that in practice they do not rely heavily on evidence, or past experience, when formulating or modifying policies and programs.” There is currently no government‑wide approach to evaluating policies and programs affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it found. The new strategy would centre Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their priorities in deciding what to evaluate and how to conduct an evaluation. “Policies and programs affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not working as well as they need to. Evaluation can play an important role filling this gap, but regrettably it is often an afterthought and of poor quality,” commissioner Romlie Mokak said. Mokak, a Djugun Yawuru man, is the first Indigenous commissioner, and former chief executive of the Lowitja Institute. “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are rarely asked about what, or how to evaluate, or what evaluation results mean,” Mokak said. “Working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is fundamental to lifting the quality of evaluations, as is planning early so that the right questions are asked and the right data collected.” The commission conducted extensive consultation across the country to build the report, and received 180 submissions. Many Aboriginal organisations were critical of the lack of evaluation of programs imposed on their communities. The Cape York Institute submission said: “Given that the total spend on Indigenous affairs in Australia is nearing $35bn annually it seems perverse and a measure of the problems, that under the current ‘system’ monitoring and evaluation does not improve results.” AbSec, the NSW child, family and community peak organisation, said external solutions were imposed on Aboriginal communities “without sufficient regard for their appropriateness and limited evaluation of their effectiveness for local Aboriginal communities”. “In short, the intended beneficiaries of Aboriginal policy and programs tend to be marginalised in the design, delivery and evaluation of those programs,” AbSec said. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said he welcomed the report. Monitoring the effectiveness of programs “is essential to informing policy development and supporting robust decision-making”, Wyatt said. “The report suggests a number of changes designed to enhance the quality of Indigenous evaluations, some of which require consideration and consultation across government and other parties. “The government will consider the report and respond appropriately,” Wyatt said.",AUS,aboriginal,0,0,1,1

It comes as an important corrective after decades of celebrating the, quote, “discovery” of the Americas by Christopher Columbus each year. We know, of course, that no such discovery happened — what did happen was colonization and centuries of subjugation, murder, disenfranchisement and displacement of Native Americans. As we reflect on our history and on the stories that have been too often excluded, we consider the importance of not just what stories get told, but of who gets to tell them.

A convoy of cars and trucks from the Kahnawake Mohawk community turned out Sunday afternoon in a show of solidarity with Indigenous fishers in southwestern Nova Scotia. In the latest incident in an escalating crisis over Indigenous fishing treaty rights, a suspicious fire early Saturday gutted a lobster pound in which Mi’kmaq fishers in Middle West Pubnico, N.S., had been storing their catches. The 39 vehicles in the convoy, several displaying large flags including the Six Nations flag and the Warrior society flag, started out shortly after 1 p.m., creating a sort of rolling blockade as they drove through Kahnawake. They headed along Highway 132 toward St-Constant before turning around and returning along Highway 132, under the Mercier Bridge and then up Highway 138. The Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers provided an escort car at the front of the convoy and another at the rear, said Constable Kyle Zachary of the Kahnawake police force. The highways remained open, but the convoy caused “an intentional slowdown to draw attention to the situation,” he said. The blaze in Middle West Pubnico was set days after raids on two facilities in the province, where Mi’kmaq fishers were storing their catches, by several hundred commercial fishermen and their supporters to protest against a “moderate livelihood” lobster fishery launched by the Sipekne’katik First Nation last month, outside the federally mandated commercial season. A Digby County man was charged on Friday after an assault on Sipekne’katik First Nation Chief Mike Sack Wednesday. On Saturday, Sack called for military support to prevent commercial fishermen from “taking the law into their own hands.” sschwartz@postmedia.com Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

9312,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-22/indigenous-elder-wants-indigenous-culture-in-national-cirriculum/12895212,"Indigenous culture should be in Australian school curriculum, elder says"," Indigenous culture should be in Australian school curriculum, elder says British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face a no-confidence vote as leader of the Conservative Party According to Darumbal elder Uncle Wade Mann, Indigenous Australian culture should become an independent subject in the national curriculum. Uncle Wade has shared his knowledge at schools for more than 16 years. He also runs cultural awareness training for parents, teachers and other workplaces in Central Queensland. ""Our culture is the longest continuous living culture in the world. It's been going for 50,000 years — unbroken,"" he said. ""It's really important that everyone understands about our culture. ""Our culture is about us being strong, being connected, connected to the land, being connected to the trees, being connected to the stars — it's about where our ancestors are, it's about who we are as people and how we've survived for so long."" Uncle Wade helped Rockhampton's Lakes Creek State School (LCSS) launch its Reconciliation Action Plan during NAIDOC week. ""Most of the schools are going that way now and recognising the First Peoples of this country, which are the Aboriginal people and the Darumbal people of this area,"" he said. ""It will help the school grow and it will empower everyone within the school."" He said he hoped schools would continue to embrace Indigenous culture beyond NAIDOC celebrations. Since 2016, Lachlan Moore has been the principal of LCSS, where 25 per cent of the cohort identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Mr Moore worked with the school's Indigenous Parent Engagement Group and local elders to develop the school's Reconciliation Action Plan. ""What we're trying to target with our plan is to celebrate that culture with our diverse student cohort, and really teach them about the land that we're on and the Darumbal people,"" he said. ""[To] also get them involved from a community perspective with our bush tucker garden and yarning circle, and not only celebrate NAIDOC week but continue to celebrate Indigenous culture."" Simone Warkill, the school's community education counsellor, said the parent group's involvement had influenced the principal's push to embed more Indigenous culture. ""They actually bring to the table what they would want to see happening, [they] bring their perspective into the school,"" she said. ""[For Indigenous] students, I believe and I'm hoping that it will give them a sense of belonging that they do belong to Lakes Creek School, that they can be proud to be a learner here. ""They see that there's respect coming through their education and learning practices in the classroom and out of the classroom as well."" Dylan Mann, a Darumbal and Byellee man, helps his father teach culture in schools. ""When I was in school, we only learnt about the non-Indigenous history of Australia,"" he said. ""It's good to see smiles on kids' faces when we do all this culture stuff, like throwing boomerangs, spears and getting them to dance along while I played the didgeridoo."" Explore NAIDOC Week content from across the ABC. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories has been a ""cross-curriculum priority"" since a 2014 review of the national curriculum. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) said it meant the priority was embedded in other subjects but it did ""not constitute curriculum"" on its own. ""They will have a strong but varying presence depending on their relevance to the learning area,"" the ACARA website stated. ACARA is conducting another review of the curriculum and it expects to publish the findings by 2022. Uncle Wade said the willingness of schools like LCSS to embrace Indigenous culture was heartening, but it was not the case in all schools. ""What I would like to see happen next within the schools is that culture … is a subject exactly the same as maths, English, science — Aboriginal culture is put there,"" he said. ""Each area should have its own curriculum about the traditional language, because in Australia there are over 350 different tribes, that's like 350 different nations."" Uncle Wade said telling their stories would help Indigenous Australians reclaim their culture. ""When we had the stolen generations, we had the hardest 70 years,"" he said. ""Our culture was lost, it was taken from us, we weren't allowed to speak our language … they weren't allowed to do their dances, they weren't allowed to eat their traditional foods. ""If you did that you were taken away and you were taken away to different parts of the state, put on the missions, and never saw your family members again. ""It's really important that we share our knowledge and we share everything with the students and the teachers.""

9805,https://www.languageonthemove.com/indigenous-language-denialism-in-australia/,Indigenous language denialism in Australia,"Gerald Roche (Senior Research Fellow, La Trobe University) and Jakelin Troy (Director, Indigenous Research, The University of Sydney) *** Source: Australian Museum Editor’s note: This week (Nov 08-15) we are celebrating NAIDOC week. “NAIDOC” stands for “National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee.” The theme of this year’s NAIDOC week is “Always was, always will be” in recognition of the fact that First Nations people have occupied and cared for the Australian continent for over 65,000 years. Indigenous Languages have been a inextricable part of this history. Yet the value of Indigenous Languages continues to be denied, as Gerald Roche and Jakelin Troy show here. *** Despite decades of research and public outreach demonstrating the importance of Indigenous languages, negative attitudes about the maintenance and revitalization of these languages persist among the general public in Australia. Here, we argue that we need to think about the tenacity of these negative attitudes as a form of denial, like climate denial or genocide denial. We also argue that now is a crucial time to confront that denial. 2019 was nominated by the UN as the International Year of Indigenous Languages, and the years 2022-2032 have been nominated as the decade of Indigenous languages. These high-profile international mega-events seemingly promise a coming era of unprecedented attention to and support for Indigenous languages. This promise extends to Australia. We joined in the International Year of Indigenous Languages, with numerous activities organized by the Department of Communication and the Arts. The Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies recognized 2019 as an “opportunity for all Australians to engage in a national conversation about Indigenous languages.” Source: Australian Museum Australia is the only country in the world that has a national schools curriculum that supports the teaching of all its Indigenous languages. ‘The Australian Curriculum Languages – Framework for Teaching Aboriginal Languages and Torres Strait Islander Languages’ provides for every school in Australia to teach one or more Australian languages—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. In spite of this historic development in our education system, most Australians seem to be oblivious or, worse, hostile to Australian languages. Plans are now afoot to take part in the coming decade of Indigenous languages, but how will Australia support Australian languages? Ongoing trends and recent events in Australia suggest that significant challenges lie ahead. The Third National Indigenous Languages Report, published in August this year, found that most of Australia’s Indigenous languages are highly ‘endangered,’ while only a small and declining number (currently 12) are considered ‘strong.’ Meanwhile, recent efforts to bolster the role of English, seen in new regulations enforcing English requirements for partner visas, have strengthened problematic associations between the English language and Australian citizenship. And most disturbingly, we continue to see the destruction of Indigenous heritage by both commercial and state parties. All of this suggests that Australia must still confront massive social and political barriers if Indigenous languages are going to flourish. As the analysis below demonstrates, denial of the importance of Indigenous languages and the reality of their revitalization persists, and are expressed in public forums with surprising impunity. Source: Australian Museum We undertook a preliminary analysis of comments made on five articles in the Conversation, published between August 2014 and July 2020; the data we analyze is available here. These articles focused on different aspects of the maintenance and revitalization of Indigenous languages in Australia. We collated a total of 49 comments from them. We began by classifying the comments into negative, positive or both/neither regarding their view of Indigenous languages. We found that 21 (42.8%) of the comments were unambiguously negative in their appraisal, while 14 (28.5%) were positive; the remaining were either neutral or ambiguous. We then examined the negative comments for recurrent themes that were used to justify and rationalize these views. We found five major themes: language revitalization is impractical; it harms Indigenous people and communities; revitalized languages are inauthentic; government support for Indigenous languages is inappropriate, and; English should be promoted instead of Indigenous languages. Each theme is examined in turn below. Commentators suggested that it was “impractical,” “absurd,” or not “feasible” to maintain and revitalize Indigenous languages, or that these languages are “doomed,” and therefore any interventions were useless. Some commentators took a modified position, suggesting that the proposed methods, rather than revitalization itself, were impractical. One commentator attempted to demonstrate the impracticality of supporting Indigenous languages with a hypothetical scenario: a factory in an “Aborigine area” where all signage would have to be in English as well as “the various Aboriginal languages/dialects,” leading to an unsafe work environment. Another theme was that maintaining and revitalizing Indigenous languages is harmful. Some suggested that supporting Indigenous languages has adverse economic impacts, primarily because English is the language of economic advancement: “English, in Australia must be the language of the classroom as it will be the key to the factory, office and other workplaces.” Others stressed that supporting Indigenous languages would isolate Indigenous people: from the rest of society, in remote locations, and in the past. Support for Indigenous language was associated with Indigenous people living “in the desert, isolated from mainstream society,” “condemned” to becoming a “living museum,” unable to “appreciate their links to people in other regions.” A variant of this argument was that providing support for language revitalization takes funds away from communities where Indigenous languages are strong. Source: Australian Museum Commentators also employed a ‘bootstraps’ argument, insisting that government interventions in Indigenous languages were inappropriate because communities should take sole responsibility for their languages. One commentator stated that “The real responsibility lies within each community to promote language usage,” while another emphasized the need for “a grass roots commitment within the community.” This point was often stressed by making comparisons with successful efforts of migrant communities to maintain their languages in Australia. These comments seemingly imply that if Indigenous communities need government support, it is because they are either unwilling or unable to maintain their languages themselves. A fourth theme in the negative comments focused on issues of authenticity. It was argued that the languages, speakers, or the use of languages were, essentially, fake. Regarding revitalized languages, it was argued that, “We don’t know what the languages were really like,” and that we can “never know” their pronunciation. Not only were the languages described as fake, but it was also asserted that, “Aboriginal people are really English speakers.” Finally, the use of such languages is also deemed inappropriate in the modern world, in places that “are now completely covered in concrete, industry, and modern life.” A final theme was that English should be prioritized. The importance of English was sometimes suggested to derive from its official status: “English is the official language in Australia.” More often, it was suggested that English ‘simply is’ the dominant language, and that prioritizing it is mere realism: “Living in Australia means speaking English.” One commentator also suggested that English is a “very rich language,” that contains “the words needed for modern, global life.” This suggests that Indigenous languages are, by contrast, ‘poor’ and have vocabularies unsuited to ‘modern, global life.’ Source: Australian Museum All the positions outlined above constitute denial insofar as they are counterfactual. In contrast to what these commentators suggest, language revitalization is thriving in Australia. Many languages of the south east and south west of Australia have come back into active use after more than one hundred years of dormancy. One such language is Kaurna of the Adelaide Plains, not spoken for more than one hundred years when its community began to reconstruct the language from sparse memories and some historic documents, assisted by linguist Rob Amery. It is now a thriving language with its community using the language on a daily basis for casual and formal communication. It began with the community wanting to teach the language in their schools and this continues today. Rather than harming Indigenous people, language revitalization is linked to increased wellbeing. In talking about the renewal of Kaurna and other languages, Kaurna educator Stephen Goldsmith says, “When we’re talking about the Aboriginal culture, we’re talking about the cultural heritage of every Australian…When people go into communities they start to understand the depth and the knowledge of Aboriginal people and how we operate as part of the environment.” Although language revitalization requires commitment from the community, it also requires government support, in both policy and funding. And languages that have undergone renewal of their use as community languages are as real and authentic as any language. Finally, English is not Australia’s official language nor is it an Australian language; it is a language of Australia, imported like the many others that are now languages of Australia. Source: Australian Museum These are all established facts, accessible to anyone who cares to look. There are debates about details, but not basic truths. Therefore, if the comments we analyze are expressions of ignorance, it is willful ignorance. More than merely counterfactual, however, these arguments are also denialist in the sense that they aim to obstruct a course of action that is suggested by those recognized facts. In this case, they aim to justify and rationalize an unjust status quo that Indigenous people have persistently spoken up against. The denialist arguments described above follow a common pattern shared with denialist efforts to suppress language revitalization elsewhere. However, they also exist in a uniquely Australian context, and an important aspect of this context is anti-Indigenous racism. A recent survey found that three quarters of Australians hold ‘implicit bias’ against Indigenous people, and the Online Hate Prevention Institute has tracked rising anti-Indigenous racism in Australian online space, particularly following this year’s Black Lives Matter protests. We need to better understand the relationships between anti-Indigenous racism and the denialist positions described here. If the UN decade of Indigenous language is going to truly help Indigenous languages in Australia flourish, it will be essential to understand both the extent of denialist sentiments, and the complex ways they interact with the wider political context. Broad public support will be essential to promoting Indigenous languages: to create a safe space where Indigenous people can undertake the difficult and emotional work of reclaiming their languages; to protect communities and individuals from backlash; to ensure that funding is secured and its use supported; and as an essential part of any political change within our democratic political system. To win this support, we have to stop denying the existence of denial, try and better understand how and why opposition to Indigenous language revitalization exists, and explore how it might be countered. Gerald Roche is a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Politics and Philosophy at La Trobe University. His research focuses on the politics of language diversity, endangerment, and revitalization. He is currently working on a research project on Tibetans and urbanization in China, focusing on the place of Tibet's minority languages in cities. Anecdotally, I have noticed quite a remarkable change in the Australian public since I started working in language revitalisation in the NT 18 years ago. I feel like years ago, conversations about language revitalisation would start with (a) what are Indigenous languages and (b) why we should care about them/think about including them in education etc. Now I feel like the average conversation is “Indigenous languages are important but is it all too hard or can we actually do something”. I remember at Ed Dept linguist told me years ago that lie about being an Aboriginal language-specialist linguist in small talk because critical or ignorant responses were so frequent. I can’t imagine anyone working in language revitalisation feeling the need to lie about their work thesedays, and on social media, I see so many ordinary Australians supportive of the notion of teaching Indigenous languages in schools. The improvement in attitude, in my opinion, is pretty clear. That’s not to say that denialism still exists. It certainly does! And analysing it is surely still valuable. But I would suggest delving further into the data used for this article. I’ve written two articles for The Conversation on Indigenous languages and, quite to my surprise actually, the comments have been largely positive, so I wondered if part of the negativity found could be to do with the article itself. Looking at the articles in which the data for this article has been drawn from I did feel like some differentiation can be made. The first four articles seem to be articles that have an underlying assumption that everyone thinks Indigenous languages should be supported and/or revitalised (e.g. “Indigenous languages won’t survive if kids are learning only English”), yet we know not all Australians believe that. To me, that explains why some people feel the need to respond negatively – as a reaction to an over-generalised assumption. The fifth article analysed, about Palawa Kani, is an ‘explainer’ type article, and I notice the comments there are more positive – appreciate of informed discussion and explanation. This was also more the style of my two Convo articles which I felt generated generally positive comments so I really think there’s another factor going on with the comment data – whether audience sentiment towards Indigenous languages has been assumed or over-generalised or not. I’m not at all saying that there are “better” and “worse” ways of writing such articles, I’m just suggesting that certain styles of article may generate certain responses so it may be worth looking more critically at the content that commenters are actually responding to. Which leads me to another point – comments on Conversation articles itself are only one measure of how these articles are responded to. And possibly a fairly limited one. Conversation articles are often shared far and wide on social media and also reposted in full by other media. To really round out an analysis of public sentiment, I think looking at social media commentary (Facebook and Twitter) on those articles will actually give a more rounded picture of what people actually think about the topic. Note that Conversation commentary is not very interactive or embedded in commenters’ social world. Conversation commenters are essentially random individuals and we have few further links to those people and little opportunity to interact with them. This makes Conversation comments susceptible to unchecked grandstanding with no further accountability (i.e. if you want to make a negative comment without it biting you on the bum, you pretty much can). On social media however, our profiles are much more linked to our social identity, and people we know and care about will see what we say and do. In my opinion, commentary on social media can very nicely round out an analysis of where public sentiment is at. But of course, I’ve done the most annoying thing you can do to busy academics – suggest them to do more analysis when we know full well NO ONE HAS ANY TIME. My main point is, despite denialism still being evident, my own experience is that there have been major changes in attitude and understanding in the past couple of decades. But, I will shut up now and say thanks for the thought provoking piece Jaky and Gerard! Hi Greg – Thanks for the feedback. You’re right that’s there’s plenty of room for further analysis, and hopefully we’ll be able to find time for that in the future. Just to respond to a few of the points you raised… In terms of general improvement of public attitudes about Indigenous languages, your comments are suggestive of how useful it would be to track these things over time (imagine having data to show how these attitudes changed over the course of years or decades!). It also makes me curious about what is actually going on in that improvement, because there are at least two things happening, I would suggest. One is the emergence of genuine positive attitudes towards Indigenous languages, and the other is increasing reticence to express overtly racist sentiments in public forums. Teasing these two apart is important because the continued existence of covert racism still drives political behaviors (like voting), and so it is really important to understand how much of changing public sentiment is simply the veiling of prejudice that could previously be expressed openly. I’ll skip the second point you raise about taking the specific nature of the articles that were commented on into account – this point is well-taken. Regarding the other methodological issue you raise – we did try and excavate some of the social media commentary about these articles, but given that they are relatively ancient by digital standards, a lot of that commentary no longer exists. But you’re absolutely right that it would provide a much richer picture of public attitudes if we were able to track responses to these articles live and in the digital wild on Twitter, Facebook, etc. This would be particularly helpful in understanding how widespread these denialist arguments are, and the extent to which they are considered publicly acceptable. So hopefully that’s something we’ll be able to do in the future. Hi Gerald and Jaky, and Greg – re your discussion of gathering and analysing more online commentary about these articles, and given Gerald has explained it couldn’t be done, perhaps you can look for new data in 2021. The federal implementation plan for the new Closing the Gap target on strengthening Indigenous languages is due out mid-year, so we should expect to see new articles, with their own satellite bodies of commentary, around that time. Obviously, I hope you can take this analysis further because it’s valuable! And whatever the results of that implementation plan will be, the target itself is another data point indicating the change in attitudes in Australia towards support for language revitalisation. But how far does that support extend, and will our government be willing or able to lead a change of attitudes for those who remain opposed? Let’s see. Thanks Gerald and Jakelin for sharing your very important and timely work. These types of arguments draw on broader negative discourses, and in turn create roadblocks to the great work that is being done to help revitalize Australia’s Indigenous languages. Identifying the fundamental flaws in each of these arguments, as you do in this post, is so valuable in combating these obstacles. Thanks Laura. Although I agree that identifying flaws in these arguments is important, I also think that it should be part of a broader strategy to countering these ideas. In labelling these attitudes ‘denialism,’ we are arguing that they are, in important ways, fact-resistant. There is some literature on how to counter this sort of denialism – work by people like Stanley Cohen, Irene Bruna Seu and Keith Kahn-Harris – and we are currently looking into that in order to learn more about effective ways of combatting Indigenous language denialism. Thanks for this thought-provoking piece! How denialist sentiments/wilful ignorance are embedded within the broader unjust political system is really an important question to think about. Despite being continents apart how identical are the language attitudes exist both in Pakistan and Australia. Both countries share a colonial past. Thank you authors for brining this to our notice. Thanks Zubair. I suspect that these sort of attitudes are very widespread, since, as you point out, they emerge from a common colonial foundation. Still, there is ample scope for comparative studies to look at how these ideologies manifest locally, and the extent to which they are connected transnationally. Thanks Gegentuul. One of the questions I would like to follow up on in future research is how these sentiments are tied to changes in the broader political context, for example, the rise of populism, the rise of the far right. Do these developments foster these ideologies and embolden people to express and act on them? And, conversely, what things might help oppose and counteract these attitudes? Answering these questions would require long-term tracking of public attitudes around Indigenous languages. This is extremely important work, for all in Australia. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas and I spent two months studying language policy in Australia in the early 1990s, which we summarised in a lengthy article, ‘Lessons for Europe from language policy in Australia’. It was published In Language Choices. Conditions, constraints and consequences (ed. Martin Pütz, Benjamins, 1997, 115-159). At the time the prospects for Aboriginal languages were grim, despite pioneer efforts by many constituencies. The blog significantly documents how much progress has been made since then, and what the challenges still are in establishing securer forms of racial and linguistic justice. It provides profound evidence of what should be done. Many thanks for your support Robert.

9850,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-54912720,Australia Post to support use of Aboriginal place names on mail,"Australia Post says it will support the optional use of Aboriginal place names on mail addresses, following a large grassroots campaign. The national mail service changed its guidelines this week to include advice on how to include traditional names. While some areas are known by their original names, many Australians often have little knowledge of place names that pre-date European settlement. Activists welcomed the endorsement of their push for greater awareness. Aboriginal woman Rachael McPhail started the campaign on social media in August, noting Aboriginal people had lived in Australia for at least 60,000 years. ""Every area in this country had an original place name prior to being given its colonial town/city name, and I believe that it's important to acknowledge this,"" she said. Australia Post advised people to identify traditional place names from a map on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, or through local land councils and cultural centres. These traditional names represent language, social or nation groups. Their general locations have been mapped by AIATSIS, which notes boundaries are not exact. Source: AIATSIS Close to 15,000 people have signed her petition. ""These are excellent first steps towards social change, so thank you again to all of you for signing the petition and emailing Australia Post,"" Ms McPhail said. In its new guidelines, Australia Post says mail senders can include original names to ""acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land your item is being delivered on"". It advises people to use the second line of the address - after the sender's name and before the street address. It also plans to introduce envelopes and packaging printed with an ""Acknowledgement of Country"" message - a standard statement in Australia which acknowledges the local people's connection to the land. Ms McPhail said she would continue to lobby Australia Post to create a national database of traditional place names, through consulting with Aboriginal elders. This video can not be played ""In order to achieve true social change and decolonisation of the address system within Australia, we need Australia Post to undertake this project,"" she said.
