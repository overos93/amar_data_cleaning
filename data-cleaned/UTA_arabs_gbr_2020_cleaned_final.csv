Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, was killed in an airstrike at Baghdad's international airport Friday, Iraqi television and three Iraqi officials said. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, the officials said. Their deaths are a potential turning point in the Middle East and are expected to draw severe retaliation from Iran and the forces it backs in the Middle East against Israel and American interests. The PMF blamed the United States for an attack at Baghdad International Airport Friday. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. or Iran. A senior Iraqi politician and a high-level security official confirmed to the Associated Press that Soleimani and al-Muhandis were among those killed in the attack. Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah, which was involved in the attack on the U.S. Embassy this week. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike occurred as soon as he descended from the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and his companions, killing them all. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject and because they were not authorized to give official statements. The senior politician said Soleimani's body was identified by the ring he wore. Soleimani had been rumored dead several times, including in a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. More recently, rumors circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria's Aleppo. Earlier Friday, an official with an Iran-backed paramilitary force said that seven people were killed by a missile fired at Baghdad International Airport, blaming the United States. The official with the group known as the Popular Mobilization Forces said the dead included its airport protocol officer, identifying him as Mohammed Reda. A security official confirmed that seven people were killed in the attack on the airport, describing it as an airstrike. Earlier, Iraq's Security Media Cell, which releases information regarding Iraqi security, said Katyusha rockets landed near the airport's cargo hall, killing several people and setting two cars on fire. It was not immediately clear who fired the missile or rockets or who was targeted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. The attack came amid tensions with the United States after a New Year's Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted President Donald Trump to order about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East. The breach at the embassy followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia. U.S. officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further retaliatory attacks in Iraq. ""The game has changed,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, telling reporters that violent acts by Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq -- including the rocket attack on Dec. 27 that killed one American -- will be met with U.S. military force. He said the Iraqi government has fallen short of its obligation to defend its American partner in the attack on the U.S. embassy. The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-U.S. relations that could further undermine U.S. influence in the region and American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington's hand in its pressure campaign against Iran.

At least three unguided projectiles have exploded inside the facility, reportedly causing no casualties. The base, located some 60km (40 miles) to the north of Baghdad, came under attack late on Saturday, Reuters reported citing security sources. Two unguided rockets hit the premises of the compound, but caused no casualties among the personnel. It was not immediately clear whether they inflicted any material damage. #BREAKING: three rocket hit al-Balad military air base — al-Sumariya. — The base hosts US forces and is located about 80 kilometers north of Baghdad. #Iraqpic.twitter.com/tBNzFxc0vs The incident hit the headlines shortly after two explosions hit the Green Zone – the heavily fortified quarter of the Iraqi capital that houses foreign missions and government buildings. One rocket reportedly hit in the vicinity of the US embassy, reportedly damaging a road. Meanwhile, Iraqi Shia paramilitary group Kataib Hezbollah has warned local forces to steer clear of any US bases or compounds housing American troops. To stay safe, they must remain at least one kilometer away from such facilities, the group said, implying that further attacks are expected. Kataib Hezbollah, which emerged during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has been waging anti-US insurgency for years. Currently, however, it is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) – a government-sponsored umbrella organization that united and recognized various militant groups during the Washington-backed campaign against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists. The incidents followed the assassination of the Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani. He was killed in a US airstrike on the outskirts of Baghdad alongside several other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi military officials. The killing prompted a furious reaction both in Iran and Iraq. Tehran vowed retaliation for Soleimani’s death, which it described as an act of international terrorism. The elite Iranian IRGC force said that at least 35 “vital” US and Israeli targets in the region are within its reach for a guaranteed strike. Iraq, meanwhile, accused the US of violating its sovereignty. Washington, for its part, insisted that the assassination was “defensive” in its nature, accusing Soleimani of being behind the deaths of “hundreds” of US citizens and alleging he was planning new attacks on the nation’s troops across the region.

Qassem Suleimani’s death in Baghdad, according to Iranian state-run media outlets, in an attack that was later confirmed by the Pentagon. A Pentagon spokesperson later confirmed missiles were fired at two or more Iraqi bases with American and coalition forces. “It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al Asad and Irbil,” Jonathan Hoffman, assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, said in a statement. “We are working on initial battle damage assessments.” More than a dozen missiles were fired at the base, he added. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, of which Suleimani was a member, also in a statement via state media: “In Operation Martyr Suleimani in early hours of Wednesday, tens of ground-to-ground missiles were fired at the U.S. base and successfully pounded the al Asad base.” The al Asad base is in Iraq’s Anbar province, which hosts some American troops. The statement continued, “The brave soldiers of IRGC’s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Assad military base in the name of martyr Gen. Qasem Soleimani. … We warn all allied countries of the U.S. that if attacks are launched from bases in their countries on Iran, they will be a target of military retaliation.” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham’s office said in a statement on Twitter the Trump administration is “aware of the reports of attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq. The President has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.” She didn’t say whether the United States has confirmed whether Iran was behind the attacks. During a meeting with key House Democrats on Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) learned about the attack, according to CNN. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said she paused the discussion to tell other lawmakers of the news, he told the website. It’s also not clear if there were any casualties. Several days ago, the U.S. military said a report about the al Asad base in Iraq being attacked isn’t true. A U.S. Central Command spokesman told The Epoch Times on Jan. 3: “That report is false.” The al Asad air base is in Iraq’s western Anbar province. It was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the ISIS terror group in Iraq and Syria. Hossein Salami, Soleimani’s successor as leader of the Revolutionary Guard, addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at Soleimani’s coffin in a central square in Kerman. He vowed to avenge Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday near Baghdad’s airport. “We tell our enemies that we will retaliate but if they take another action we will set ablaze the places that they like and are passionate about,” Salami said. The United States said Soleimani was responsible for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country’s civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Assad in Syria on Tuesday amid the tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","none","none",0,0,0,0

The statement made no mention of Iran, which claimed that it had fired ballistic missiles at the Ain al-Asad airbase in retaliation for the US killing of a top Iranian general. ""Between 1:45 am and 2:15 am (2245 GMT and 2315 GMT) Iraq was hit by 22 missiles, 17 on the Ain al-Asad air base and ... five on the city of Arbil,"" the Iraqi military said. ""There were no victims among the Iraqi forces,"" it added, but did not mention whether or not there were casualties among foreign troops. Ain al-Asad is the largest airbase where US-led coalition troops are based. Arbil is the capital of the Kurdish region, and a top official from the regional government said no American military base or US consulate was hit there. The official also said there were no casualties in Arbil. President Donald Trump on Tuesday took to Twitter following the strike to say an ""assessment of casualties & damages taking place now."" ""So far, so good!"" he wrote. It was the first time Iran directly targeted a US installation with ballistic missiles. Over the last two months, US troops and even the embassy in Baghdad had been targeted in more than a dozen rocket attacks that Washington blamed on pro-Tehran groups, but none had been claimed. --Agence France-Presse","none","none",0,0,0,0
"7",114,"https://www.fox5dc.com/news/pentagon-34-us-troops-diagnosed-with-traumatic-brain-injuries-after-iran-missile-strike-on-iraqi-base","Pentagon: 34 US troops diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries after Iran missile strike on Iraqi base","At least 34 U.S. troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries after an Iranian missile strike hit an Iraqi air base earlier this month, officials at the Pentagon announced Friday. WASHINGTON - The Pentagon disclosed on Friday that 34 U.S. service members suffered traumatic brain injury in Iran's missile strike this month on an Iraqi air base, and although half have returned to work, the casualty total belies President Donald Trump's initial claim that no Americans were harmed. He later characterized the injuries as “not very serious.” Eight of the injured arrived in the United States on Friday from Germany, where they and nine others had been flown days after the Jan. 8 missile strike on Iraq's Ain al-Asad air base. The nine still in Germany are receiving treatment and evaluation at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the largest U.S. military hospital outside the continental United States. Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said the eight in the U.S. will be treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at Bethesda, Maryland, or at their home bases. The exact nature of their injuries and their service and unit affiliations were not disclosed. Trump had initially said he was told that no troops had been injured in the strike, which Iran carried out as retaliation for a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran's most powerful general, Qassem Soleimani, on Jan. 3. The military said symptoms of concussion or traumatic brain injury were not immediately reported after the strike and in some cases became known days later. Many were in bunkers before nearly a dozen Iranian ballistic missiles exploded. The question of American casualties took on added important at the time of the Iranian strike because the degree of damage was seen as influencing a U.S. decision on whether to counter-attack and risk a broader war with Iran. Trump chose not to retaliate, and the Iranians then indicated their strike was sufficient for the time being. Tensions have since eased. After the Pentagon reported on Jan. 17 that 11 service members had been evacuated from Iraq with concussion-like symptoms, Trump said, “I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious.” He said he did not consider the injuries to be as severe as those suffered by troops who were hit by roadside bombs in Iraq. Traumatic brain injury, or TBI, has become a bigger concern for the military in recent years as medical science improves its understanding of its causes and effects on brain function. It can involve varying degrees of impairment of thinking, memory, vision, hearing and other functions. The severity and duration of the injury can vary widely. The Defense Department has said more than 375,000 incidents of TBI occurred in the military between the years 2000 and 2018. Jefferson Kinney, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, where he is chair of the department of brain health, said Friday that much remains to be learned about TBI, including its effects on behavior. “It depends a lot on how severe the damage is and where the damage is,” among other factors, he said. “There is huge variability across individuals. Some people will undergo a trauma that they seem to recover from very quickly and others seem to be much more impacted by it for a longer duration.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a severe TBI may lead to death or result in an extended period of coma or amnesia. Hoffman's disclosure that 34 had been diagnosed with TBI was the first official update of the number injured since the Pentagon announced the evacuation of the first 11. On Jan. 21, officials said more had been sent out of Iraq for further diagnosis and treatment, but the Pentagon declined to provide firm figures or say whether any had been returned to duty. Hoffman said that of the 34 with TBI, 18 were evacuated from Iraq to U.S. medical facilities in Germany and Kuwait, and 16 stayed in Iraq. The one American sent to Kuwait has since returned to duty in Iraq. All 16 who stayed in Iraq have since returned to duty there, Hoffman said. No one was killed in the attack on Ain al-Asad, even though the U.S. had no missile defense systems there to protect from potential attack. Hoffman said Friday that deploying one or more Patriot anti-missile systems to Iraq is among options now being weighed by military commanders. The U.S. had deployed numerous Patriot systems to other countries in the region as protection against Iranian missile attack, including in Saudi Arabia, but a strike on Iraq was seen as less likely. Some members of Congress this week pressed the Pentagon for more clarity on the scope of the TBI cases resulting from the Iranian attack. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, wrote senior Pentagon officials on Thursday requesting additional details on casualties from the attack. On Friday morning, Defense Secretary Mark Esper directed the Pentagon’s acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Matthew Donovan, to begin working with the staff of the Joint Chiefs to review how military injuries are tracked and reported — not just TBI cases but battlefield injuries of all kinds, Hoffman told reporters. Advertisement “The goal is to be as transparent, accurate, and to provide the American people and our service members with the best information about the tremendous sacrifices our war fighters make,” Hoffman said.

Washington and Baghdad should not discuss troop withdrawal, the US State Department has said, refusing parliament's request for US soldiers to leave. Protesters in Iraq urged both the US and Iran to stop their meddling.   After Iraqi lawmakers voted to oust US troops, the US State Department dismissed their demand and said Washington and Baghdad should instead focus on fixing their alliance. ""Any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership — not to discuss troop withdrawal,"" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday. The US, which invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, currently has some 5,200 soldiers on Iraqi soil. The troops are training and assisting Iraqi forces in the fight against the remnants of the defeated ""Islamic State"" (IS) militia. On Friday, the State Department said the US forces were crucial for the anti-IS effort and would not discuss removing them. Instead, the two sides should talk about ""our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,"" the US said. Iraqi militia head killed alongside Soleimani The latest row between Iraq and the US was triggered by a US drone attack near Baghdad airport which killed Iran's General Qassem Soleimani and powerful Iraqi militia head Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. In a non-binding vote on Sunday, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution asking the US troops to leave and asking the Iraqi government to formally demand a US withdrawal. In an apparent blunder, the US military's Task Force Iraq pledged to ""prepare for onward movement"" of US troops ""in deference to the sovereignty of the Republic of Iraq"" in a letter sent on Monday. However, the US officials were quick to dismiss the message as a ""draft"" that was sent by mistake. Several top US military officials have said there were no plans for US forces to withdraw. Iraq's caretaker prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi then presented the request to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone call on Thursday night. Between rock and hard place Also on Friday, protesters gathered in Baghdad and southern Iraq to demand that both Iran and the US stop meddling in Iraqi politics. Both Washington and Tehran are nominally allies of the Baghdad government. Iran is ruled by Shiite clerics who also exert a large influence on the Shiite majority in Iraq. The US also has many instruments to pressure the Iraqi officials, including waivers on sanctions against Iran. Washington currently allows Iraq to import Iranian gas despite sanctions, but the arrangement is set to expire in February. Iraq is also home to large Sunni and Kurdish populations, which oppose the idea of a US withdrawal and see US forces as a shield against unchecked power of Shiite factions. dj/msh (AP, Reuters, AFP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

The murdering terrorist is a martyr to the man calling for troops to leave Iraq. According to an Arabic news site, Al Arabiya, the Parliament voted and approved “a resolution asking the Iraqi government to end the agreement under which Washington (U.S.) sent forces to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against ISIS.” It doesn’t take a general of war to realize that taking the 5,000 plus U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, out, would severely cripple Iraq’s chance at holding ISIS at bay. In fact, it will ensure the “resurgence” of ISIS in the region. Apparently, “the majority of about 180 legislators present in Parliament voted in favor of the resolution. It was backed by most Shia members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats. Many Sunni and Kurdish legislators did not show up for the session, apparently because they oppose abolishing the deal.” The keyword in this is “PRESENT”. So we are seeing the Shia members, who have had long ties to terrorist groups located in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, holding a partisan vote that will bolster these terrorist groups in their region. Hmmm, it seems oddly familiar. Democrats on Twitter will explode with the news that PM Abdul Mahdi claims to have invited Soleimani to Iraq to aid in de-escalating the tensions between U.S. and Iran. The reality that is more likely is that Abdul Mahdi was giving Soleimani a go-ahead to continue his attacks on U.S. forces and the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. The truth that the democrats will not touch on is that Abdul Mahdi has resigned as PM and the Parliament accepted the resignation on December 1, 2019, due to escalating protests against his treatment of Iraqi civilians. Abdul Mahdi was responsible for, “imposed curfews, internet blackouts, and deployed lethal force in attempts to quash the protests. The government said it only shoots when attacked, but demonstrators have disputed that.” Abdul is a part of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution (SCIRI). According to the START’s (Study of Terrorism and Responses of Terrorism) website,”SCIRI advocates for the creation of a separate, Shiite controlled region in southern Iraq as well as political control in Iraq’s government. The Badr Brigade (SCIRI’s military wing) had tens of thousands of men trained in Iran and fought alongside Iranian troops during the Iraq-Iran war, which lasted from 1980 through 1988. In 1991, thousands of troops in the Badr Brigade went to Iraq to support the Shiite rebellion in the south.” So we have a transitioning out of office PM who is owned and controlled by a political party that has committed acts of terrorism all over the region. This PM is now calling and helping orchestrate a vote to expel the only troops capable of holding these terrorists at bay. HOW MUCH MORE PROOF DO YOU NEED? It sounds to me that Abdul Mahdi is trying to position himself to become the next dictator of Iraq. How many Democrats will knowingly back another terrorist? Luckily for Iraq, we remember how to handle terrorists. Enter Your Email:  Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. ","none","none",0,0,0,0

The deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was one of the Iraqi officials killed by the drone strike on Soleimani last week.

After threatening the “fool and a blackmailer” Trump as well as the U.S. military, Al Telbawi also demanded that American citizens “pressure” Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq “before we send your soldiers back in coffins.” He also suggested American civilians could be the target of terror attacks. “If the American people re-elect Trump to the US presidency [in 2020], this would mean they support his crimes,” said Al Telbawi. “This may change our position towards the American people.

The big picture: While tensions between the U.S. and Iran seem to be lessening, Abul-Mahdi is standing his ground and backing the Iraqi parliament's non-binding resolution to expel all U.S. troops from the country. Why it matters: A U.S. exit from Iraq could ultimately be one of the most consequential results of the escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, because it would significantly hamper the fight against ISIS and achieve a major Iranian objective. The other side: The State Department issued a statement rebuffing Abdul-Mahdi's request, saying, ""At this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership — not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East.""

U.S. bases in Iraq and military presence, at present more than 5,000 troops, are the most convenient means of force against Iran. Other than controlling the rich and highly strategic territory of the Middle-East as an important step towards world hegemony, the U.S. continuous presence in the region also has to do with profits for the war industry and with the price and control of hydrocarbons, especially gas. We have seen, soon after the cowardly murder of General Qassem Suleimani, the share values of the war industry jumped up, of course in anticipation of a hot war – and huge weapons sales. The war industry profits insanely from killing. Wars and conflicts are increasingly what drives the western economies. Already in the U.S. the war industry and related industries and services make up for about half of the country’s GDP. The U.S. economy without war is unthinkable. Therefore, the Middle-East is a perfect eternal battle ground – a sine qua non for the west. War is addictive. The western economy is already addicted to it. But most people haven’t realized that – yet. Revolving and renewed conflicts and wars is a must. Imagine, if the U.S. were to leave the Middle-East, PEACE might break out. This is not admissible. Soon, your job my depend on war – if you live in the west. Then there is the Iranian gas. Daily 20% to 25% of all the energy consumed to drive the world’s economy – including wars – transits through the Golf of Hormuz which is controlled by Iran. Immediately after the heinous murder on General Suleimani, the oil and gas prices spiked by about 4%, later declining again. This, in anticipation of a major conflict which could have Iran reduce her gas production, or block the passage of Hormuz. In either case a collapse of the world economy could not be excluded. As a parenthesis – it is so absolutely necessary that the world frees itself from this nefarious source of energy – hydrocarbons – and converts to other, cheaper, cleaner and FREER sources of power to drive our industries and activities. Like solar energy of which Mother Earth receives every day more than 10,000 time what it needs for all her industrial and creative activities on every Continent. The U.S., with a flailing multi-trillion fracking industry which just failed the European market, due Russian gas via Nord Stream2, and just inaugurated Turkstream, would like to control the price of hydrocarbon, so as to revive the highly indebted fracking industry. What better way than to control Iran, and her enormous reserves of gas, shared with Qatar? Then there is the close alliance between Iran and China – China being Iran’s largest customer of gas. China is perceived by Washington as a deadly competitor, and barring her from the energy that makes China’s economy thrive, is one of those devilish objectives of the United States. They are unable to compete on an even playing field. Cheating, lying and manipulating has become part of their, and the western life style. It is deeply ingrained in western history and culture. Of, course there are other ways of supplying China with the hydrocarbons she needs. Russia with the world’s largest gas reserves, could easily increase her supplies. In brief, the U.S. is unlikely to leave the Middle-East, although some generals – and even some high-ranking Pentagon brass – believe this would be the smartest thing to do – they see the light, and the light is not war, but PEACE. How to Get the US out of Iraq What could Iraq do to get the U.S. out of Iraq and eventually out of the Region? After all, the Iraqi Parliament has taken a majority decision to regain Iraq’s sovereignty and autonomy, without foreign troops. Most countries with troops stationed in Iraq respect that decision. Denmark, Australia, Poland and Germany are preparing to move their troops out of Iraq. Only the UK with her 800 military men and women decided for now to stay alongside the U.S. Iraq may want to strengthen her alliance with Russia and China, hereby increasing the pressure on the U.S. to honor Iraq’s sovereign request for the U.S. to leave. How much that would take to materialize, if at all, is a difficult question to answer. Maybe ‘never’. Except, if the U.S.-dollar hegemony over western economies can be broken. And at the moment, a strong down-turn of the dollar’s role in the world economy is showing, as the western world is increasingly seeking ways to de-dollarize her economy and to associate with the East, led by China and Russia, where de-dollarization is advancing rapidly. When that happens, chances are that the U.S. of A’s dictates over the nations of the world will be mute, will not be listened to anymore, and that Washington will have to rethink its future – and very likely a U.S. presence in the Middle-East will be history.

Iraq's prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call Thursday to send a U.S. delegation to Iraq to negotiate the withdrawal of U.S troops, according to a statement released Friday by the Iraqi leader. But the State Department's chief spokeswoman said the U.S. presence in Iraq is a ""force for good"" and U.S. officials would not discuss a military withdrawal. ""At this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership – not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,"" said Morgan Ortagus, the spokeswoman. During a news briefing Friday about new Iran sanctions, Pompeo said he would be ""happy to continue the conversation with the Iraqis about what the right structure is"" for U.S. troops in the country. But, Pompeo added, the U.S. military mission there ""is very clear"": to train Iraqi security forces and fight the Islamic State. ""We're going to continue that mission,"" he said. America's military presence in Iraq has become a flashpoint between the two allies after President Donald Trump's decision last week to kill a top Iranian general who was in Baghdad. Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who led an elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. The strike also killed an Iraqi military official, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was the deputy commander of an Iran-backed militia organization known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. Abdul-Mahdi has called the U.S. strike a political ""assassination"" and a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. Trump administration officials have defended the strike as legal and necessary, saying Soleimani was planning attacks on U.S. assets in the region. But they have declined to provide evidence of the plot and have given conflicting accounts of how ""imminent"" it was. ""There is no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qasem Soleimani, and we don’t know precisely when and we don’t know precisely where, but it was real,"" Pompeo said during an interview with Fox News that aired Thursday. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring U.S. troops home from far-flung ""endless wars,"" and he has ordered drawdowns in Syria and Afghanistan. The U.S. has an estimated 5,000 American troops in Iraq, but Trump has resisted Iraq's pressure to bring them home. Such a move would be fraught with political and national security implications, including a possible resurgence of the Islamic State. ""A complete US military withdrawal in the current context would be disastrous,"" William Wechsler, director of the Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank, wrote in a recent Jan. 5 analysis. For starters, it would ""abandon Iraq to Iranian influence"" just as Iraq is choosing a new prime minister, said Wechsler. Iranian leaders have said their main goal in the wake of Soleimani's death is to drive the U.S. out of the Middle East. A U.S. withdrawal now could also pave the way for a resurgence of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. It would be a ""gift to ISIS,"" Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said at an Atlantic Council forum on Thursday. ""This is an incredibly dangerous moment,"" Murphy added, referring to the potential for both Iran to expand its influence in Iraq and for ISIS to make a comeback there. Iraq's parliament on Sunday approved a nonbinding resolution calling for U.S. troops to leave. U.S. officials have noted the vote was taken when Sunni, Kurd and some Shiite lawmakers, who hold more favorable views toward the U.S. military mission, were not present. Pompeo suggested the anger at the U.S. in Iraq would pass, and he noted that the current prime minister is on his way out of office. ""We’ve been in their country, we’ve been supporting Iraqi sovereignty, we’ve been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the Iraqi people,"" he said Sunday on Fox News. ""The prime minister is the resigned prime minister ... We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign."" But Abdul-Mahdi's comments to Pompeo suggests he is pushing ahead with that demand, despite his own caretaker status and the recent steps toward de-escalation between Tehran and Washington that have put Iraq on the brink of a proxy war between the U.S. and Iran. More:Iran got its revenge for Qasem Soleimani's killing but the US Navy is still a target More:Iran plane crash: U.S., Canada say intel shows Ukraine jet downed by Iranian missile The Iraqi leader asked Pompeo to ""send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament's resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq,"" said the statement from Abdul-Mahdi. ""The prime minister said American forces had entered Iraq and drones are flying in its airspace without permission from Iraqi authorities and this was a violation of the bilateral agreements,"" the Iraqi leader's statement added. Ortagus said the U.S has been ""unambiguous"" about how crucial the U.S. mission is in Iraq. American troops are there to help fight the Islamic State. She said U.S. officials are willing to talk to Iraqi leaders, but not about withdrawing. ""There does ... need to be a conversation between the U.S. and Iraqi governments not just regarding security, but about our financial, economic, and diplomatic partnership,"" she said. ""We want to be a friend and partner to a sovereign, prosperous, and stable Iraq."" More:House votes to limit Trump's ability to wage war with Iran after Soleimani killing Top American military officials including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper have said there are no plans for the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq. But military officials sowed confusion about the U.S. commitment earlier this week, when a letter, written by U.S. general to Iraqi officials, suggested the U.S. was preparing to withdraw because of the Iraqi parliament's vote. Esper and Milley told reporters it was a draft letter and a mistake. Simmering tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated sharply after Dec. 27, when a rocket attack, blamed on an Iranian-backed militia group, caused the death of an American contractor at a base in Kirkuk province. The U.S. responded with a barrage of strikes on the militia's bases, killing at least 25 people. Pro-Iranian protesters then stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, temporarily stranding diplomats inside and leaving parts of the compound damaged and charred. Trump then ordered the Soleimani strike. Iran responded by launching more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases that house U.S. and coalition forces. No Americans or Iraqis were killed in the Iranian strikes. And tensions began to ratchet down Wednesday when Trump said Iran seemed to be ""standing down"" and he, too, signaled that Washington would be stepping away from further confrontation.

Gen. Qasem Soleimani last week, which drew threats of retaliation from Iran and its regional allies against U.S. troops in Iraq and beyond….In comments to the Iraqi cabinet, broadcast on state television, Abdul Mahdi expressed exasperation with the conflicting signals coming from Washington. The letter he received “was clear,” he said, in its reference to a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. “It’s not like a draft or a paper that fell out of the photocopier and coincidentally came to us,” he told the cabinet. Two Iraqi officials said the caretaker prime minister had read the letter as a signal of a U.S. intent to withdraw and concluded that it was necessary in light of the spiraling tensions between the United States and Iran, which risk putting Iraq in the middle of a new war….Abdul Mahdi has asked the United States to put in place a timeline for a withdrawal, the official said. The letter that we’ve all seen wasn’t signed by anyone, but apparently the copy Abdul Mahdi received did bear a signature. So it was a wee bit more than a “mistake.” I wonder how serious Abdul Mahdi is about following through with a complete American withdrawal? This is not quite the way I envisioned us leaving Iraq, but I’ll take it. We shouldn’t be there, and if Donald Trump’s blundering is what it takes to get us out, then I’ll count it as an ugly win, but a win nonetheless.

"18",314,"https://americanmilitarynews.com/2020/01/iraqi-syrian-informants-helped-us-track-soleimani-before-strike-reuters/","Iraqi, Syrian informants helped US track Soleimani before strike: Reuters","Falih al-Fayadh, Iraq’s National Security Adviser and head of Iraq’s pro-Iranian Popular Mobilization Front (PMF) Shi’ite militias, is looking into whether Syrian and Iraqi informants helped coordinate the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Among those suspected of leaking Soleimani’s whereabouts to the U.S. are two Baghdad airport security workers and two employees for Cham Wings, the private airline that secretly brought Soleimani to Baghdad on the night he was killed. According to an exclusive from Reuters, Iraq’s National Security investigators have “strong indications that a network of spies inside Baghdad Airport were involved in leaking sensitive security details,” the resulted in the U.S. successfully targeting and killing Soleimani. Soleimani reportedly avoided using his private plane, amid concerns about his security. Cham Wings had instead enabled Soleimani and his security entourage to travel aboard a Cham Wings flight with their names removed from the passenger manifest. Soleimani landed in Baghdad to join Abu Mahdi Muhandis, the deputy head of the same PMF group al-Fayadh leads, only to be killed minutes later by a U.S. drone firing two missiles. Soleimani’s security team, traveling in a separate vehicle, was hit by another missile seconds later. The Iraqi investigation into how Soleimani was killed on their watch reportedly began within minutes of the airstrikes. Iraqi National Security agents immediately moved to seal off the airport and contain security staff from leaving. Cham Wings is based out of the Syrian capital of Damascus, and Soleimani was reportedly flying from Syria into Iraq when he was killed. “Initial findings of the Baghdad investigation team suggest that the first tip on Soleimani came from Damascus airport,” one Iraqi security official told Reuters. “The job of the Baghdad airport cell was to confirm the arrival of the target and details of his convoy.” Neither the media office for the Iraqi National Security agency or Iraq’s missions to New York and Washington D.C. responded to Reuters’ requests for comments on the case. The U.S. Department of Defense also declined to comment on whether well-placed informants helped track Soleimani. Meanwhile, U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity did say the U.S. had been tracking Soleimani’s whereabouts in the days preceding the strike, but did not detail how they confirmed his exact location. Starting in October, Soleimani had reportedly secretly increased attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and increased the flow of weapons to proxy pro-Iranian militias in Iraq that helped carry out the attacks. Those pro-Iranian militias reportedly carried out deadly rocket attacks and instigated further attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in the days leading up to Soleimani’s death.

President Trump and U.S. officials had said earlier that no Americans were killed or injured in the Jan. 8 attack. Several U.S. troops ""were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed. As a standard procedure, all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injury, and if deemed appropriate are transported to a higher level of care,"" Capt. Bill Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said Thursday. AERIAL IMAGES OF IRANIAN ATTACK ON IRAQ BASE He said that although no U.S. service members were killed in the attack on Al Assad Air Base, ""in the days following the attack, out of an abundance of caution, some service members were transported... to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, others were sent to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, for follow-on screening. When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq following screening. The health and welfare of our personnel is a top priority and we will not discuss any individual's medical status. At this time, eight individuals have been transported to Landstuhl, and three have been transported to Camp Arifjan."" The explosions at the base, about 110 miles west of Baghdad, created large craters, knocked over concrete barriers and destroyed facilities that house dozens of soldiers. The attack on the Al Assad base, where about 1,500 American and coalition forces are stationed, was carried out in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iraq claimed its sovereignty had been violated by the killing, and took swift action in calling for all U.S. armed forces to leave the country. U.S. forces had first used the base after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State terror network.

AP's earlier story follows below. A stampede broke out Tuesday at the funeral for a top Iranian general slain in a U.S. airstrike, and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession, Iranian news reports said. BAGHDAD (AP) — The Pentagon said Thursday that the U.S. military has killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, at the… As the crowds mourned Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, more angry calls rose from Iran to avenge his death, drastically raising tensions in the Middle East. The U.S. continued to reinforce its own positions in the region and warned of an unspecified threat to shipping from Iran in the region's waterways, crucial routes for global energy supplies. U.S. embassies and consulates from Asia to Africa and Europe issued security alerts for Americans. The U.S. Air Force launched a drill with 52 fighter jets in Utah, just days after President Donald Trump threatened to hit 52 sites in Iran. Tuesday's deadly stampede took place in Soleimani's hometown of Kerman as his coffin was being borne through the city in southeastern Iran, said Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran's emergency medical services. There was no information about what set off the crush in the packed streets, and online videos showed only its aftermath: people lying apparently lifeless, their faces covered by clothing, emergency crews performing CPR on the fallen, and onlookers wailing and crying out to God. ""Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,"" Koulivand said, and state TV quoted him as saying that 56 had died and 213 had been injured. WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is sending nearly 3,000 more Army troops to the Mideast as reinforcements in the volatile aftermath of the… Soleimani's burial was delayed, with no new time given, because of concerns about the huge crowd at the cemetery, the semi-official ISNA news agency said. A procession in Tehran on Monday drew over 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main avenues and side streets in Tehran. Such mass crowds can prove dangerous. A smaller stampede at the 1989 funeral for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini killed at least eight people and injured hundreds. Hossein Salami, Soleimani's successor as leader of the Revolutionary Guard, addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at the coffin in a central square in Kernan. He vowed to avenge Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday near Baghdad's airport. ""We tell our enemies that we will retaliate but if they take another action we will set ablaze the places that they like and are passionate about,"" Salami said. ""Death to Israel!"" the crowd shouted in response, referring to one of Iran's longtime regional foes. Salami praised Soleimani's work, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran's enemies, Salami said. Soleimani will ultimately be laid to rest between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades killed in Iran's 1980s war with Iraq. They died in Operation Dawn 8, in which Soleimani also took part. It was a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the war that killed 1 million. The funeral processions in major cities over three days have been an unprecedented honor for Soleimani, seen by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force. The U.S. blames him for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Assad in Syria on Tuesday amid the tensions between Washington and Tehran. Soleimani's slaying already has led Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge. In Iraq, pro-Iranian factions in parliament have pushed to oust American troops from Iraqi soil following Soleimani's killing. Germany and Canada announced plans to move some of their soldiers in Iraq to neighboring countries. According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans to avenge Soleimani's death. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a ""historic nightmare"" for the U.S. He declined to elaborate, ""If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out,"" Shamkhani said. The state-run IRNA news agency later published a statement from the Supreme National Security Council denying Shamkhani made the comment. The U.S. Maritime Administration warned ships across the Mideast, citing the rising threats. ""The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region,"" it said. Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year that the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied responsibility, although it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world's crude oil travels. The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat. The 5th Fleet ""has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region,"" 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Iranian Gen. Alireza Tabgsiri, the chief of the Guard's navy, issued his own warning. ""Our message to the enemies is to leave the region,"" Tabgsiri said, according to ISNA. The Guard routinely has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf. Separately, Iran summoned the British ambassador over comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the British defense minister about Soleimani's killing, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Iran's parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military's command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani's killing as ""terrorists,"" subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be in response to a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a ""terrorist organization.""  The U.S. killed Iran's Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a targeted air attack. The U.S. Defense Department used that terror designation to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The action by Iran's parliament was done by a special procedure to speed it into law and also saw the lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million. Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for meetings at the United Nations. As the host of the U.N. headquarters, the U.S. is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings. ""This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people,"" Zarif said. ""But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that."" Asked about Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists America would comply with its obligations under U.N. rules to grant visas. He then referred to the Iranian diplomat as ""a propagandist of the first order."" A U.S. official who wasn't authorized to speak on the record said the application couldn't be processed in time for Zarif's travel although it wasn't clear if his request had been formally denied. A formal rejection would trigger legal technicalities that could affect future visa applications and could violate the host country agreement the U.S. has with the U.N. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Posted By: Chris Badger Thomas January 18, 2020  Chris “Badger” Thomas RIGHT WING TRIBUNE–OPINION Eleven U.S. service members were flown out of Al Assad Air Base in Iraq and treated for concussion symptoms after Iran’s rocket attack targeting two Iraqi military bases earlier this month, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command revealed Thursday night, Fox News reports. President Trump and U.S. officials had said earlier that no Americans were killed or injured in the Jan. 8 attack. Several U.S. troops “were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed. As a standard procedure, all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injury, and if deemed appropriate are transported to a higher level of care,” Capt. Bill Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said Thursday. The troops were medevaced this week to Germany and Kuwait to be treated for traumatic brain injury after experiencing concussion symptoms. Nearly one dozen American troops were wounded in Iran’s Jan. 8 missile attack on Iraq’s al-Asad air base. This week, they were medically evacuated to U.S. military hospitals in Kuwait and Landstuhl, Germany, to be treated for traumatic brain injury and to undergo further evaluation. “Out of an abundance of caution, some service members were transported from Al Asad Air Base, Iraq to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, others were sent to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, for follow-on screening,” said Col. Myles Caggins, spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve. “When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq following screening. The health and welfare of our personnel is a top priority and we will not discuss any individual’s medical status.” Several news organizations soon reported from al-Asad that U.S. troops had been alerted to the attack hours in advance, and told to head for bunkers 15 minutes before the missiles began to strike. Many U.S. troops, however, manned exposed positions, including at least one group of drone operators who stayed in an above-ground building to get their drones aloft and avoid ground damage. The leader of an Army drone team told NPR that he was “knocked off his feet by the blast.” Others told the New York Times that missiles damaged the building they were in.

"25",423,"https://popularresistance.org/iraqi-prime-minister-tells-pompeo-to-remove-us-troops-pompeo-refuses/","Iraqi Prime Minister Tells Pompeo To Remove US Troops, Pompeo Refuses","Washington, DC – On Thursday night in a telephone call, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to start working out a road map for a US troop withdrawal from Iraq. Abdul-Mahdi showed his insistence following the vote of the Iraqi Parliament on Sunday, January 5, which directed the removal of the US military’s presence in Iraq. According to the statement about the call, “The prime minister said American forces had entered Iraq and drones are flying in its airspace without permission from Iraqi authorities, and this was a violation of the bilateral agreements.” The Prime Minister asked Pompeo to “send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament’s resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq,” according to the statement. Iraq’s sovereign elected government voted 170-0 to remove US troops. And the US rogue regime is refusing to listen. This is a criminal military occupation of a sovereign foreign nation. The US claims it’s “a force for good,” but the people in the actual region say the OPPOSITE pic.twitter.com/RBdblZntEA — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) January 10, 2020  The United States rejected the troop withdrawal request made by the Iraqi government: “On Friday, the U.S. State Department flatly dismissed the request. It said the presence of U.S. troops was crucial for the fight against the Islamic State group and it would not discuss removing them. “Any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership — not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,” said spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.” In response to the vote by Parliament on US troop withdrawal, top US military officials including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, said there were no plans for the US to withdraw. The State Department, following through on President Trump’s statement that NATO play a larger role in Iraq, said on Friday: “Today, a NATO delegation is at the State Department to discuss increasing NATO’s role in Iraq, in line with the president’s desire for burden sharing in all of our collective defense efforts.” There are currently 5,200 US troops in Iraq and President Trump has deployed 4,000 more troops to Iraq. In addition to escalating rather than removing troops, the US is making economic threats saying there needs “to be a conversation between the US and Iraqi governments not just regarding security, but about our financial, economic, and diplomatic partnership.” The US has granted a waiver to Iraq that allows the country to continue importing Iranian gas to meet electricity demands, which expires in February. The US has used this waiver as leverage against Iraq in the past. After the Parliament voted on Sunday, Trump said: “If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame. We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.” Iraq has become a battleground between the US and Iran. The people of Iraq do not want their nation to be where the US and Iran fight their conflict. AP reports that protesters “lambasted the ongoing diplomatic crisis between Iraq, the U.S., and Iran in mass protests across the capital and southern provinces.” In Baghdad’s Tahrir square, thousands of protesters showed their anger and many chanted “Damn Iran and America!” Large demonstrations were also held in southern provinces of Basra, Dhi Qar, Najaf, and Diwanieh. According to Reuters, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric, said it was Iraqis who stood to suffer most from the US-Iranian conflict. He condemned the US-Iranian confrontation taking place on Iraqi soil, saying it risked plunging an already war-ravaged country and the wider Middle East into deeper conflict. He described the latest actions as “repeated violations of Iraqi sovereignty. . . Iraq must govern itself and there must be no role for outsiders in its decision-making.” Another cleric warned during Friday prayers in Tehran that the United States’ bases in the region now created risks. Mohammad Javad Haj Aliakbari, a mid-ranking cleric, told worshippers “From now on, having too many bases, especially in this region, will not act as an advantage for them.” Iran wants the US out of the Middle East. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani also vowed to eject the US from the region in response to Suleimani’s death. A senior aide to Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati, warned US forces are risking a drawn-out, bloody and unsuccessful stay in the Middle East and “they must leave the region,” further, according to the state-affiliated Fars news agency. “If they do not leave the region, they will face another Vietnam.” After 17 years of chaos and destruction of multiple countries, the US may find that a rapid withdrawal will serve US interests better than a slow, bloody defeat forcing them out of the region. President Trump left an opening for leaving the region when he said: “We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil and gas.” This could become an excuse for the US to leave the region. The United States is unwelcome in Iraq after the assassination of General Qassem Suleimani. If the US remains, it will become an occupying force. Suleimani developed an Arc of Resistance across the Middle East. Members of that Resistance may also take retribution independently of Iran. The US presents many targets in the region to its opponents. Leaving the region is the best option for the US and the countries and people of the Middle East.

Baghdad, Iraq – Leaders of several Iraqi Shia armed groups have condemned President Barham Salih’s meeting with his United States counterpart President Donald Trump, with some threatening to force Salih to resign. The meeting between the two presidents took place on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday. It came amid rising regional tensions that spilled over in Iraq after the killing of the leader of Iran‘s Quds Force, General Qassem Soleimani, and the simultaneous assassination of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy leader of the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces or PMF) in an airstrike ordered by Trump near Baghdad airport earlier this month. Al-Muhandis was also the founder of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed armed group that the US targeted in Iraq and Syria on December 30, killing at least 25 fighters and injuring more than 50. The attack was in response to the killing of a US civilian contractor two days earlier. Sadr calls for ‘million-man march’ against US presence in Iraq Iraqi parliament calls for expulsion of foreign troops Iraq protests swell with people angry at slow pace of reform Supporters and members of Kataib Hezbollah and other paramilitary groups within the PMF, an umbrella organisation of mostly Iran-backed Shia armed groups, responded by storming the US embassy in Baghdad. Mohammad Mohie, a spokesperson for Kataib Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera that the group considered the Salih-Trump meeting “deeply humiliating and inconsiderate of the loss of Iraqi blood”. “Trump has committed unforgivable crimes against the Iraqi people. How could Salih join hands with someone who has no respect for Iraq’s sovereignty and the blood of its martyrs?” Mohie asked. “He [Salih] has positioned himself against the Iraqi people. We call on him to step down and not return to Baghdad. He is no longer welcome among us.” Echoing those sentiments, Nasser al-Shammari, deputy secretary-general of the al-Naujabaa Brigades, another Shia armed group in Iraq, told Al Jazeera: “The hands of this man [Trump] are covered in Iraqi blood. “Most Iraqi people consider this [meeting] treacherous. We no longer accept him [Salih] as our representative and won’t rest until he’s held accountable for going against the will of the Iraqi parliament and disregarding our martyrs’ blood. “He must step down and be banished from Baghdad,” al-Shammari added. Following the meeting, Naeem al-Aboudi, a member of the Sadiqoon parliamentary bloc, the political arm of the Iran-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq armed group, wrote on Twitter: “A statesman should not violate his country’s constitution and sovereignty, or be a reason to infuriate millions of his people.” The PMF, which was legally integrated into Iraq’s state security forces last year, did not issue a formal statement on the meeting. Its media representative, Mohannad Hussein, told Al Jazeera: “We are part of the Iraqi government. It is within diplomatic protocols for heads of state to meet.” Critics say some of the armed groups within the umbrella organisation operate independently of Baghdad. Ahead of the meeting, Kataib Hezbollah had warned that Salih would be “violating the will of the people” if he met Trump. In a statement ahead of the event, the Shia paramilitary group al-Nujabaa said it hoped Salih “rejects meeting this fool”. In his address in Davos, Salih said: “Iraq is indebted to the US-led coalition for its military and economic support which [it] continues to provide in the fight against ISIL. “The US-led military coalition was essential in allowing Iraqi forces to defeat ISIL. “The Iraqi parliament’s vote to expel US troops was not a sign of enmity. It was just a reaction to what many Iraqis saw as a violation to their country’s sovereignty, an issue that will be addressed through dialogue.” A statement from the Iraqi presidency said that the two heads of state discussed “reducing foreign troops in the country and the importance of respecting the demands of Iraqi people to preserve the country’s sovereignty”. In a joint news conference with Salih, Trump said the US and Iraq had “a very good relationship” and said the number of US troops in the country was “historically low”. Trump also met the president of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, Nechirvan Barzani, at the Swiss resort. While Iraq’s populist Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr did not issue a statement about the meeting, the move has amplified support for his calls for a “million-man march” against US troops in the country. The leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Qais al-Khazali, issued a video statement condemning the meeting and called on Iraqis to join the march scheduled for Friday morning in Baghdad. The leader of the Iran-backed group warned that the US will have to face the consequences if it “continues to disregard Iraq’s political and public will to expel US troops”. Reiterating a similar message, Shammari told Al Jazeera: “We expect an unprecedented number of people to take part on Friday. It will reignite the flame of resistance which won’t die until we expel every single one of them [US troops] from Iraq. “This is the will of the Iraqi people and the parliament,” he added. Sadr’s calls for the march came just days after the country’s parliament voted to expel foreign troops and cancel its request for assistance from the US-led coalition that had been working with Baghdad to fight ISIL. Around 5,000 US troops are left in Iraq – most of them soldiers who came to Iraq in an advisory capacity to help the PMF from 2014 to 2017 in their fight against ISIL. The parliament vote earlier this month provoked Trump to threaten “sanctions like they’ve never seen before” on Iraq. Abdullah al-Salam reported from Baghdad. Arwa Ibrahim reported from Doha.

Parliament voted to remove the US troops, however the ruling is not valid unless signed by the prime minister. Iraq's caretaker prime minister Abdul Mahdi is not legally authorized to sign the bill into law, according to The Washington Post. Abdul-Mahdi resigned last year in response to the anti-government protests and political parties have been unable to agree on a new prime minister, and Abdul-Mahdi remains in a caretaker capacity. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked shortly before the parliamentary vote whether the US would comply with the request for American troops to leave. ""We'll watch. We're following very closely what's taking place in the Iraqi Parliament,"" Pompeo told ""Face the Nation."" ""It is the United States that is prepared to help the Iraqi people get what it is they deserve and continue our mission there to take down terrorism from ISIS and others in the region."" .@DrSJaishankar and I spoke just now regarding Iran’s continued threats and provocations. The Trump Administration won’t hesitate to act to keep American lives, and those of our friends and allies, safe. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 5, 2020 Around 5,000 American troops are based in Iraq, where they mainly train Iraqi forces and help to combat the Islamic State. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed to end the US military's presence in the Middle East, saying U.S. bases, warships and soldiers are now fair targets. ""The suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased,"" Nasrallah said. Also, a former leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard suggests that the Israeli city of Haifa and ""centers"" like Tel Aviv could be targeted following the death of Soleimani in the US strike. Soleimani's death is being called a ""significant blow"" to Iran. The US knew that Soleimani was behind the recent attack on the US embassy in Baghdad and Defense Secretary Mark Esper had issued a warning saying on MSNBC, ""Enough is enough. We have all the capabilities to either respond to further attacks or take preemptive action if additional attacks are being prepared."" ""What happened was a political assassination. Iraq cannot accept this,"" Abdul-Mahdi said during an address to the parliament. US officials have made it clear they are prepared to meet any response from Iran. Did you know?

""We ask security forces in the country to get at least 1,000 meters away from US bases starting on Sunday at 5:00pm (1400 GMT),"" said the group. The vehemently anti-American group's statement came after mortars and rockets hit near the US embassy and a base where US troops are stationed. Mortar rounds hit an area near the US embassy in Baghdad on Saturday evening, security sources told AFP. Moments later, two rockets slammed into an Iraqi base where American troops are deployed, security sources said. The Iraqi military confirmed the missile attacks in Baghdad and on Balad base and said there were no casualties. Planes from the US-led coalition were heard circulating above their bases in Kirkuk province, AFP's correspondent there said. A US defence official said the coalition's surveillance capabilities had been redirected away from the Islamic State group to focus on possible new rocket attacks. The missile attacks appeared to be the first hints of a retaliatory response to the killing by the US of a top Iranian general near Baghdad airport on Friday. Iran's Major General Qasem Soleimani was killed alongside top Iraqi paramilitary commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in the US drone attack, which was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Tehran and Washington.

It is well known that Vaughn’s political preference is more conservative than most of the Hollywood denizens. They are infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome and jump on anyone who dares support the president. Iraq veteran Colby Smith revealed a “heroic” story about Vince Vaughn. He met him while he was serving in an area known as the “triangle of death.” It was a very dangerous area, and because of that, celebrities like the Denver Broncos refused to visit the soldiers serving there. In fact, no one ever visited them. When Vince Vaughn found out that no one would go there and meet the troops, he decided to go. He was briefed on how dangerous the area was, but that did not deter him. During his visit, there were mortars being fired at them. Colby Smith told his story. I find it inspiring that a celebrity like Vaughn would risk death to visit soldiers that no one else would.  From The Daily Caller: “When we got there the marines had just pulled out,” Smith shared, as he took us back to that day. “We had lost a lot of guys. I want to say 11 guys within a few weeks before he [Vaughn] arrived. It was a very tough time.” “Like we heard about the Denver Broncos coming to Baghdad and no one ever stopped where we were at,” he added. “We were getting shot at. I got hit by four IED’s myself. So Vince Vaughn came, we got mortared.” The veteran continued, “He [Vaughn] had been fully prepped that this was not a safe place. He did this [visit] because he heard that there was no one else coming to see these guys. And he did.” “He was perfect,” Colby went on to explain, noting how he lifted them all at a time they so desperately needed it. “He smiled, he was happy. One of the guys in the unit made a sign that read, ‘if you can dodge an IED, you can dodge a ball.’ He [Vaughn] thought it was great, so he was running around with the sign.” “He figured out where the medic station was,” he added “[Vaughn] said, ‘I wanted to come see you guys.’ And he just hung out. He didn’t ask questions.” Smith continued, while recalling how this “A-list actor” just sat there and played an X-box NCAA football video game with him. “The way I felt, he was more in awe of all of us then we were of him,” Colby said. “And that was really cool.” Share Tweet Share Share 18 comments  News From The Beltway and Beyond TBR is a news aggregation and opinion site and contains commentary on news stories from around the internet.

Now dozens of important artefacts that were removed from Iraq in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are being brought back into focus in an exhibition drawing on groundbreaking discoveries made by Iraqi archaeologists amid the turbulence of the country’s recent history. Among the objects on display is a small dolerite statue dating to around 2130BC, purchased by the museum in the 1930s. It depicts a king called Gudea, who ruled the ancient city of Girsu, one of the world’s first urban civilisations, on the site of modern-day Tello in southern Iraq. The statue shows him in a position of prayer, as do many others of him, according to Sebastien Rey, a curator of ancient Mesopotamia at the museum. But while experts knew from written sources that Gudea constructed a temple in his city, no trace of it had been found. That changed thanks to a discovery made through the Iraq emergency heritage scheme, set up by the British Museum in 2015 to train local archaeologists in heritage protection at a time when many of the country’s historical sites were under threat from destruction by Islamists. By revisiting the site after decades, Rey and a team of local trainee archaeologists discovered not only the site of the king’s 4,000-year-old temple, but also a bakery attached to the temple where huge quantities of bread would have been produced as offerings to the gods. It is believed to be the first example of this kind of set-up in history, ranking it as an “absolutely 10/10 and beyond” discovery, Rey said. The purpose of other museum-owned items that have puzzled experts for decades has also become clear as a result of the heritage scheme digs. For example, a collection of inscribed cones: similar items were found inside the temple’s walls as talismanic deposits. Iraqi law forbids archaeological discoveries from being removed from the country, so the new finds will be represented in photographs, reconstructions and video alongside the museum’s own collection. The exhibition, titled Ancient Iraq: New Discoveries, will visit the Great North Museum in Newcastle and the University of Nottingham Museum between March and December.","none","none",0,0,0,0

At this time, eight individuals have been transported to Landstuhl, and three have been transported to Camp Arifjan."" The explosions at the base, about 110 miles west of Baghdad, created large craters, knocked over concrete barriers and destroyed facilities that house dozens of soldiers. The attack on the Al Assad base, where about 1,500 American and coalition forces are stationed, was carried out in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iraq claimed its sovereignty had been violated by the killing, and took swift action in calling for all U.S. armed forces to leave the country. U.S. forces had first used the base after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State terror network. Trump visited the sprawling airbase in December 2018, making his first presidential visit to troops in the region. Advertisement Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.

Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said eight soldiers who had been treated in Germany were sent to the U.S. for treatment. Nine others were being evaluated in Germany, he said, while one soldier who was evacuated to Kuwait for treatment had returned to duty in Iraq; 16 who had remained in Iraq after diagnosis have returned to duty. The announcement came two days after President Donald Trump, who initially said no Americans were injured in the strike, downplayed the extent of injuries among the subsequent 11 cases. ""No, I heard that they had headaches, and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report, it's not very serious,"" Trump told reporters in Davos. He contrasted the brain injuries with soldiers who lost limbs from roadside bombs in Iraq. His comments at the time brought a sharp rebuke from some veterans groups. “Don’t just be outraged by #PresidentMayhem’s latest asinine comments,” Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, wrote in a Twitter post that day. “Take action to help vets facing TBIs,” referring to traumatic brain injuries. US service members injured in Iraq: How soon do concussion symptoms appear? The Jan. 8 Iranian strikes on bases in western Iraq appeared aimed at avoiding mass casualties among U.S. troops hunkered down there. In the end, there were no fatalities. The missiles were launched in retaliation for a U.S. operation that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, Iran's most powerful military commander, in early January. About 18 hours later after the attack, Trump said in an address to the nation that ""no Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases."" But ""in the days following the attack,"" 11 people were taken out of Iraq for medical screening, according to a statement from the U.S. Central Command in the region Thursday. ""Several were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed,"" the statement said. Concussions are mild forms of traumatic brain injuries. Common symptoms of concussions – headache, memory loss and confusion – may not show up immediately, according to the Mayo Clinic. The symptoms can last for days, weeks or longer. Concussions are usually caused by a blow to the head. Some but not all concussions can cause victims to lose consciousness. Experts say it's common for patients not to immediately recognize or report their symptoms. ""At the beginning, when you have the injury, most people are in a hyper-alert state. You're not acutely aware, and you're masking some of the things that might be happening. Subtle changes in memory and concentration – you may not feel them until you are challenged to do an activity,"" said Pablo Celnik, physiatrist-in-chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. ""If you're in the field and being attacked, and there are minor symptoms early on, the adrenaline surge that you get is something that could get you to ignore the early symptoms to deal with the emergency that's in front of you. So you might not immediately report what’s going on,"" said Daniel Torres, a neurologist at NYU Langone’s Concussion Center.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. At least four Iraqi soldiers were wounded on Sunday in a rocket attack on the Balad airbase in northern Iraq, according to Reuters. The outlet reported that the Iraqi military said in a statement that the base, which also houses US personnel, was targeted by eight Katyusha rockets that were fired from about 50 miles (80 km) north of Baghdad. According to the report, seven of those rockets hit the base's runway. No casualties among the US forces were reported, according to Reuters, and the military statement did not identify who was behind the attack. The injuries come just days after an attack on two military bases in Iraq that house US forces that were launched by Iran as tensions between the countries escalated following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the high-profile head of Iran's elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in an airstrike on January 2 at Baghdad's international airport in accordance with orders from President Donald Trump. The strike immediately triggered security concerns for US entities in the region as Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said that a ""harsh retaliation is waiting"" for Americans. The Pentagon said in a statement after it completed the fatal airstrike that it had targeted Soleimani because he ""was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,"" as the White House emphasized that the strike was ordered as a measure to increase security and peace.

State TV described it early Wednesday as Tehran’s revenge operation over the killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani. U.S. forces could not be immediately reached for comment. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the White House is aware of the reports. “The President has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team,” she said. Ain Assad air base is in Iraq’s western Anbar province. It was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. State TV said the operation’s name was “Martyr Soleimani.” It said the Guard’s aerospace division that controls Iran’s missile program launched the attack. Iran said it would release more information later. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. A stampede broke out Tuesday at the funeral for a top Iranian general slain in a U.S. airstrike, and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession, Iranian news reports said. As the crowds mourned Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, more angry calls rose from Iran to avenge his death, drastically raising tensions in the Middle East. The U.S. continued to reinforce its own positions in the region and warned of an unspecified threat to shipping from Iran in the region’s waterways, crucial routes for global energy supplies. U.S. embassies and consulates from Asia to Africa and Europe issued security alerts for Americans. The U.S. Air Force launched a drill with 52 fighter jets in Utah, just days after President Donald Trump threatened to hit 52 sites in Iran. Tuesday’s deadly stampede took place in Soleimani’s hometown of Kerman as his coffin was being borne through the city in southeastern Iran, said Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran’s emergency medical services. There was no information about what set off the crush in the packed streets, and online videos showed only its aftermath: people lying apparently lifeless, their faces covered by clothing, emergency crews performing CPR on the fallen, and onlookers wailing and crying out to God. “Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,” Koulivand said, and state TV quoted him as saying that 56 had died and 213 had been injured. Soleimani’s burial was delayed, with no new time given, because of concerns about the huge crowd at the cemetery, the semi-official ISNA news agency said. A procession in Tehran on Monday drew over 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main avenues and side streets in Tehran. Such mass crowds can prove dangerous. A smaller stampede at the 1989 funeral for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini killed at least eight people and injured hundreds. Hossein Salami, Soleimani’s successor as leader of the Revolutionary Guard, addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at the coffin in a central square in Kernan. He vowed to avenge Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday near Baghdad’s airport. “We tell our enemies that we will retaliate but if they take another action we will set ablaze the places that they like and are passionate about,” Salami said. “Death to Israel!” the crowd shouted in response, referring to one of Iran’s longtime regional foes. Salami praised Soleimani’s work, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran’s enemies, Salami said. Soleimani will ultimately be laid to rest between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades killed in Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq. They died in Operation Dawn 8, in which Soleimani also took part. It was a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the war that killed 1 million. The funeral processions in major cities over three days have been an unprecedented honor for Soleimani, seen by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force. The U.S. blames him for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country’s civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Assad in Syria on Tuesday amid the tensions between Washington and Tehran. Soleimani’s slaying already has led Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge. In Iraq, pro-Iranian factions in parliament have pushed to oust American troops from Iraqi soil following Soleimani’s killing. Germany and Canada announced plans to move some of their soldiers in Iraq to neighboring countries. According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans to avenge Soleimani’s death. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a “historic nightmare” for the U.S. He declined to elaborate, “If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out,” Shamkhani said. The state-run IRNA news agency later published a statement from the Supreme National Security Council denying Shamkhani made the comment. The U.S. Maritime Administration warned ships across the Mideast, citing the rising threats. “The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region,” it said. Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year that the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied responsibility, although it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world’s crude oil travels. The U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat. The 5th Fleet “has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region,” 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Iranian Gen. Alireza Tabgsiri, the chief of the Guard’s navy, issued his own warning. “Our message to the enemies is to leave the region,” Tabgsiri said, according to ISNA. The Guard routinely has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf. Separately, Iran summoned the British ambassador over comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the British defense minister about Soleimani’s killing, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Iran’s parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military’s command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani’s killing as “terrorists,” subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be in response to a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a “terrorist organization.” The U.S. Defense Department used that terror designation to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The action by Iran’s parliament was done by a special procedure to speed it into law and also saw the lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million. Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for meetings at the United Nations. As the host of the U.N. headquarters, the U.S. is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings. “This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people,” Zarif said. “But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that.” Asked about Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists America would comply with its obligations under U.N. rules to grant visas. He then referred to the Iranian diplomat as “a propagandist of the first order.” A U.S. official who wasn’t authorized to speak on the record said the application couldn’t be processed in time for Zarif’s travel although it wasn’t clear if his request had been formally denied. A formal rejection would trigger legal technicalities that could affect future visa applications and could violate the host country agreement the U.S. has with the U.N. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

A resolution passed by a special session of parliament said the government should cancel its request for assistance from a US-led coalition. Parliament resolutions, unlike laws, are non-binding to the government. But this one is likely to be heeded: Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi had earlier called on parliament to end foreign troop presence as soon as possible. ""Despite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,"" Abdul Mahdi said. The special session was called after a US drone strike on Friday on a convoy at Baghdad airport that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Since the killings, rival Shi'ite political leaders have called for US troops to be expelled from Iraq in an unusual show of unity among factions that have squabbled for months. ""There is no need for the presence of American forces after defeating Daesh (Islamic State),"" said Ammar al-Shibli, a Shi'ite lawmaker and member of the parliamentary legal committee, before the parliamentary meeting. ""We have our own armed forces which are capable of protecting the country,"" he told Reuters. Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militia and U.S. troops fought side by side during Iraq's 2014-2017 war against Islamic State militants. Around 5,000 US troops remain in Iraq, most of them in an advisory capacity. Abdul Mahdi, who holds the post in a caretaker role after resigning in November amid street protests, called on Friday for parliament to convene the extraordinary session to take legislative steps to protect Iraq's sovereignty. Hadi al-Amiri, the top candidate to succeed Muhandis, repeated his call for U.S. troops to leave Iraq on Saturday during a funeral procession for those killed in the attack. Many Iraqis, including opponents of Soleimani, have expressed anger at Washington for killing him and Muhandis on Iraqi soil and potentially dragging their country into another conflict. বাংলাদেশে তৃতীয় শ্রেণিতে অধ্যয়নরত শিশুদের মাত্র ৩৪ শতাংশের পড়তে পারে। এই শ্রেণির শিক্ষার্থীদের মধ্যে মাত্র ১৮ শতাংশের গুণতে পারার প্রাথমিক দক্ষতা আছে। এক্ষেত্রে সুবিধাবঞ্চিত শিশুদের অবস্থা আরও খারাপ।","none","none",0,0,0,0

Last week, the U.S. military carried out airstrikes in Iraq and Syria -- days after a U.S. defense contractor was killed at a military compound in a rocket attack. U.S. officials have blamed the militia for a rocket barrage that killed a U.S. defense contractor, wounded four U.S. troops and two members of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) near Kirkuk, in northern Iraq. Military fighter jets conducted ""precision defensive strikes"" on five sites of Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Iraqi militia, Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman had told Fox News.

It proclaims the spot is the “the site of the American crime,” where on January 3rd, a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy leader of Iraq’s government-sanctioned armed groups and a legendary anti-ISIS commander among the country’s majority Shi’ite community. Another sign of the anti-U.S. sentiment in Iraq: the quarter- to half-a-million Iraqis who peacefully took to the streets of Baghdad on Friday to protest the killing and demand all American troops leave the country. The gathering was a disciplined but undeniable display of the growing resentment of the U.S. military mission that had been welcomed in 2014 to fight ISIS, and a clear signal of how the rising political fortunes of pro-Iranian Iraqi politicians like march organizer Shi’ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr could hasten the departure of U.S. troops. “Sadr was on good behavior today because he wants now to be known as pragmatic politician instead of Molotov-cocktail-throwing politician,” one senior U.S. official said of the march, speaking anonymously to describe the precarious security situation of U.S. diplomats in Iraq. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was attacked on New Year’s Eve by Iraqi militiamen who surrounded and breached the compound’s gates over a 24-hour period before Iraqi security forces finally intervened. Two Iraqi officials estimated Sadr’s Friday crowd reached 500,000, but the senior U.S. official put it at “two-hundred thousand marchers, not the million he’d called for.” Nevertheless, the U.S. official added, “He’s still a force to be reckoned with.” Sadr, a longtime political enemy of the U.S. whose armed militia used to target American forces during the U.S. occupation of the country, ordered his followers on Friday not to enter the security zone housing the embassy, and they listened. It’s part of a policy of non-violent resistance agreed upon by Sadr and other top Iraqi militia leaders in the wake of Soleimani’s death. The leaders met in Qom, Iran, roughly two weeks ago, according to a senior Iraqi official, choosing to convene outside Iraq partly out of fear that they too might be targeted or at the very least, surveilled, after the Soleimani-Muhandis killing. “Sadr protected Iraq from Iran-U.S. rivalries, and called for diplomatic means, not violence, for ‘evicting’ the U.S. troops,” says Dlawer Ala’Aldeen, president of the Erbil-based Middle East Research Institute. Sadr also “protected the U.S. presence indirectly,” by focusing Iraqi popular rage into a nonviolent protest, derailing other militia group’s calls for blood. The march shows the rising power of the pro-Iranian blocks in Iraq despite months of violent popular protests directed against Iran and the parties allied with it that led to the resignation of Iraq’s now-caretaker Prime Minister Adel al-Mahdi. “This gave them a boost politically to the pressure him… to follow through with kicking U.S. troops out,” the senior Iraqi official told TIME. The hobbled Iraqi leader has been grappling with how to enact a parliament vote demanding the exit of U.S. troops after the U.S. attack, whose ouster al-Mahdi has publicly embraced even as he has privately slow-rolled the action. He fears a total American pullout will prompt the departure of Western troops who have been training Iraqi security forces as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, and drain the country of international investment. Those concerns have done little to shift opinions on the street — or the demands of politicians like Sadr whose political fortunes are allied with Iran and its long-term goal of removing U.S. troops from the region. For now, al-Mahdi, who largely derives his political power from the Iranian-aligned groups, has been able to delay immediate action, as he does a “risk assessment” on how the withdrawal would affect the ISIS fight. His hesitation has also been leavened by President Donald Trump’s threats to sanction Iraq and force it to pay for improvements the U.S. military made to an Iraqi air base if U.S. troops are expelled. “We are happy to continue the conversation with the Iraqis about what the right structure is,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a State Department news conference, after announcing U.S. troops would be staying put. On that front, the Americans and Iraqis may find some common ground. “The status quo is unacceptable, but a full withdrawal is unacceptable as well,” a senior Iraqi official involved in the discussions says. “We still have a common enemy called Daesh (ISIS) which we can’t just forget…but we need to redefine the U.S. role. Spying on Iran and assassinating generals won’t work,’” he said. Alternatives like NATO taking over the mission might appease public sentiment, he suggested, and restore the Iraqi government’s trust in American forces. It’s an idea that is apparently on the table in Washington. “We’re at an early stage in looking at what NATO can do to expand the mission it already has in Iraq,” Amb. James Jeffrey, U.S. Special Envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told reporters Thursday. “We have said that we’re not interested in talking about withdrawal because we don’t think we should withdraw; however, at the end of the day, this is obviously an Iraqi decision.” “There’s a lot of people who want us to stay in Iraq as partners,” said Joey Hood, the former deputy of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, now the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, in a Friday interview on Iraq’s news and satire program, the Albasheer Show. He defended killing Soleimani on Iraqi soil. “It was not a choice so much as a necessity. This guy…was not only planning attacks on Americans, he had actually started carrying them out,” referring to the 2019 rocket attack that killed an American contractor in Kirkuk and the Iranian proxy attack on the U.S. embassy. “We needed to take action as soon as we could and where we could…It’s unfortunate that these sorts of things have to happen. We don’t want Iraq to be a battleground for anyone.” Contact us at letters@time.com.","none","none",1,1,0,0
"46",754,"https://www.newsweek.com/military-aircraft-runway-among-damage-iraqi-base-struck-iran-missiles-1481129","Military aircraft, runway among damage at Iraqi base struck by Iran missiles","Iran's missile attack on two large military bases in Iraq damaged installations housing U.S. service members and battered an airplane hangar, aircraft, buildings and runways. Preliminary reports from American and Iraqi military officials reported that Iran fired 22 missiles at both Al Asad Airbase in western Iraq and at the airbase near Erbil in the north. Two Defense Department officials told Newsweek that 18 ballistic missiles struck Al Asad Airbase alone. The attacks wrecked one Blackhawk helicopter and damaged a runway air traffic control tower. Three missiles slammed into the base's runway, leaving large craters. The attacks also ""lightly damaged"" a MQ-1 Predator Drone and destroyed 10 military tents. Two of Iran's missiles struck the base in Erbil while the remaining two missiles failed to cross the Iraq-Iran border. A senior Defense Department official told Newsweek that no significant damage was reported at Erbil. Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper and Army General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that the ballistic missiles were fired from three separate locations inside Iran and involved 16-short-range ballistic missiles, with 12 impacting Al Asad Airbase with only one striking the airbase near Erbil. No deaths have been reported in the attack. American and Iraqi officials provided a battle damage assessment to top Pentagon leadership Wednesday after missile bombardment against the U.S. military and coalition forces housed at the bases in Tuesday's attack Iranians called ""Operation Martyr Soleimani."" It came as part of a significant escalation of force in retaliation over the United States' killing of the country's top commander, Major General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, in a drone strike. The minimal damage and lack of coalition casualties is attributed to the Iraqi government, which provided the United States with advanced warning of Iran's missile attack. The U.S. intelligence community also picked up heat signatures of the incoming ballistic missiles, giving U.S. personnel and coalition forces time to seek shelter under concrete and sandbagged bunkers, according to Defense Department officials who spoke to Newsweek. An Iraqi intelligence official told Newsweek Wednesday they expected Al Asad Airbase to be attacked but were surprised by the strike at the base in Erbil. Satellite photos provided to Newsweek via the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and taken Wednesday by the commercial company Planet, show the damage inflicted on airplane hangars and buildings. Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been mounting since Nawres Hamid, an American defense contractor, was killed last month after U.S. authorities say Iranian-backed militia fired rocket artillery at the K-1 Base in Kirkuk. Several others were wounded in the December attack. While it marked a major escalation of force, Tehran's missile bombardment from inside its borders—rather than its reliance on rockets fired by Iranian-backed proxies—also was seen as a measured response to the Trump administration's actions. It was intended to demonstrate that Iran had the capability to strike American targets in Iraq but instead focused on areas at the military installations that would not result in U.S. or coalition casualties. Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, defended the action on Twitter Tuesday: ""Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched."" He added: ""We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression."" Zarif comments echoed Defense Secretary Esper's comments during a Pentagon press briefing Tuesday and on CNN. ""We are not looking to start a war with Iran, but we are prepared to finish one,"" Esper said. However, General Milley, Trump's highest ranking military officer, broke from what both U.S. military and Trump administration officials charactered as a measured response from Iran who appeared to target areas of the base that would avoid casualties. ""I believe based on what I saw...they [Iranian missiles] were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles...and to kill personnel, that's my own personnel assessment"" said Milley speaking to reporters. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump threatened Iran with additional economic sanctions as his administration continued to explore their ""options,'' but assured Americans that the United States was not seeking to launch a war. ""The American people should be extremely grateful and happy, no Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime...only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases,"" he said flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, his U.S. military generals and cabinet secretaries from State and Defense in the Grand Foyer of the White House. ""Iran appears to be standing down,"" he said. In his public address, Trump appeared to lay blame for the attacks on the Obama administration, saying that ""the missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration,"" referring to the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The United States withdrew from the agreement aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief in May 2018, a move that contributed to current tensions.

The MPs have passed a resolution calling for foreign troops to leave the country after the US killed a top Iranian general in a drone strike at Baghdad airport last week. Parliament in Baghdad also asked the Iraqi government to work to ban foreign forces from using Iraqi land, airspace or water for any reason. “The government commits to revoke its request for assistance from the international coalition fighting Islamic State due to the end of military operations in Iraq and the achievement of victory,” the resolution read. The US has some 5,000 military personnel in Iraq, mainly as advisers. Thousands of Iraqis attended a funeral procession for Qasem Soleimani before his body was flown to Iran. The non-binding resolution was passed on Sunday after Iraq’s caretaker Prime Minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, called for an end to the foreign military presence in a speech to MPs. What does the resolution say exactly? It calls on the government to revoke its request for assistance from the international coalition fighting IS due to “the end of military operations in Iraq and the achievement of victory”. It says “the Iraqi government must work to end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, airspace or water for any reason”. Furthermore, the government must file a formal complaint to the UN against the US “for its serious violations and breaches of Iraqi sovereignty and security”. Ahead of the vote, the prime minister said the US military presence in the country should be ended as soon as possible. Ending the US military presence in Iraq was “better for reorganising healthier and correct relationships with the US and the rest of the states”, Mr Abdul Mahdi said. ","none","none",0,0,0,0

Those currently stationed in Iraq are most vulnerable to attack from Iran and Iran-allied groups. Soleimani's assassination significantly elevated the risk to Americans in Iraq, as acknowledged by the Trump administration when it instructed Americans to leave. The crisis Trump created could also provide an opportunity. Trump and American policymakers can now act in the direct interests of the United States while also improving relations with Iraq, a key regional partner. The Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution on Sunday to cancel its military aid request to coalition forces, effectively reversing its 2014 invitation for US troops to deploy to Iraq to fight and contain Islamic State (IS). Arguably, once IS had been deprived of all strategic territory as of December 2017, the US should have pulled out, their mission accomplished. The Iraqi parliament vote provides cover for the US military to gracefully exit Iraq now. Removing US troops affirms the authority of Iraq's parliament, while simultaneously reducing the threat to American lives. Moreover, withdrawing from Iraq reduces the likelihood of further escalation with Iran, while improving the US-Iraq relationship, which had frayed the longer the US stayed beyond its stated mission.  If US troops in Iraq are attacked by Iran, the Trump administration will feel compelled to respond, and the US will soon be fighting yet another war in the Middle East. Current circumstances are even more inclined towards war than the conditions that preceded the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was not precipitated by an attack on US forces. The current US-Iran relationship exhibits alarming parallels to US relations with Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. The US had imposed heavy sanctions on Iraq, and was concerned about Iraq acquiring or possessing weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's leadership was seen as cruel, dictatorial, and illegitimate, which allowed Bush administration officials to claim the US would be welcomed as ""liberators"". Also similar to Iraq, the US could probably defeat Iran in a conventional war. Yet the US would face massive opposition and likely armed insurgency if it invades Iran, just like it did in Iraq.  Like with Iran now, the US had no official diplomatic relations with Iraq between 1990 and 2003. US officials had very little information about Iraqi society and in lieu of diplomatic expertise, the Bush team relied on a group of Iraqi exiles who were eager for the US to overthrow Saddam Hussein's government. Yet these individuals had themselves been out of Iraq since the 1980s, had no support base within the country, and had no more accurate information about circumstances in Iraq than US officials. The exact same dynamics - the lack of understanding of state and society, of regime dynamics, of potential post-conflict evolution, and reliance on exiles with no public support inside the country - are present in Iran. Moreover, war with, and possible invasion of Iran would present greater difficulties than Iraq. Iran has a larger population and bigger GDP, despite sanctions. The Iranian government has greater legitimacy than Saddam Hussein's regime. Anti-government protestors have vanished in the wake of Soleimani's assassination, replaced by massive expressions of national unity and calls for retaliation against the US. As in Iraq, the neoconservative agenda calls for regime change in Iran. Yet the decision to dismantle the Baathist regime and disband the Iraqi military led to the rise of IS. Although these choices are widely seen as some of the worst foreign policy blunders in recent American history, the US is on the brink of implementing the same approach. To ""make Iran safe for democracy,"" the entire Iranian government and military would have to be dismantled, similar to the policies implemented in Iraq. These actions, while not only requiring a huge coercive force and vast resources, would likely provoke even stronger resistance from Iranian society. Any military action would automatically bolster nationalism, already a potent force in Iran. Conventional wisdom has it that Trump would rather avoid an all-out war with Iran and prefer instead to focus on re-election. He knows that his base likes it when he puts ""America First"" by beating up Iran on Twitter, but that is different from getting into what would be a messy, volatile, long-term conflict - and he knows it. However, Trump also knows that if US soldiers were attacked by Iran - and a media narrative absolves Trump of responsibility for starting this whole mess - his base would rally around him. No war-time president has ever lost re-election. Although Trump has thus far managed to avoid provoking all-out war, the impeachment may have spurred him to adopt more extreme means of distraction.  The presence of US troops in Iraq makes war with Iran significantly more likely. It was the continued presence of US troops in Iraq that helped lead to the circumstances in which a US military contractor was killed, provoking retaliatory airstrikes, and setting off a cascade of events resulting in the storming of the US Embassy complex in Baghdad, which then apparently prompted the decision to target Soleimani. There is a brief window within which American service members can be made more secure by withdrawing them from Iraq. This must occur before Iran or its allies attack them, and the US is drawn into another war in the Middle East, one that is even more costly and destructive than the war in Iraq. The ongoing presence of American troops in the region does not enhance US or regional security; it makes Americans more vulnerable to attack and further mired in endless wars in the region. That was true before the assassination of Soleimani, it is even more true today. It's time to bring the troops home to safety. Annelle Sheline is a Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute.

Police have arrested her ex-husband, Yasir A. Darraji, 30. He has been charged with first-degree murder. A police officer drove by the car on 27th Avenue near Fiske Street at about 9 p.m. Friday. When he passed by again, about 20 minutes later, the inside of the car was on fire, court documents show. He called the Spokane Fire Department who responded and found Ibtihal Darraji’s body. according to court documents. The Spokane County Medical Examiner said the cause of her death was strangulation. Ibtihal and Yasir Darraji divorced about four years ago and have two children together. On the night of her death, Ibtihal texted her friend that she was on her way to pick up her son from Yasir and then would stop by to drop off a few things. She never arrived. Friends interviewed during the investigation told police of multiple threats Yasir had made against his ex-wife over the last few years, court documents show. The couple’s 13-year-old daughter told police that on the night of her mother’s death, her father left for work at 6:11 p.m. and wasn’t home when she woke up the next morning, something she found unusual. Yasir told police he was upset because he smelled marijuana in Ibtihal’s car when she picked up their young son the night of her death. He then intended to go to work as a Lyft driver but was so upset that he ended up just driving around, according to court documents. The time frame that he was gone changed multiple times during police interviews, according to court documents. He said he left as early as 6:30 p.m. and came home as late as 9:30 p.m. Ibtihal’s car was discovered on fire at about 6:20 p.m. Ibtihal worked at St. Aloysius Church until September, said Don Weber, the church administrator. Last summer she went home to Baghdad to visit her mother and when she came back, she told her co-workers that she feared for her life because family members didn’t want her to return to Spokane. “Our understanding is she was part of an arranged marriage to her husband,” Weber said. Ibtihal was about 16 years old when she had her daughter. Her son was born a few years later and is in elementary school, Weber said. Weber described the boy as a “very sweet, nice kid that cared a lot about his mother.” The car was a recently purchased Toyota Prius that she bought from the Society of Jesus at Gonzaga University. An ex-girlfriend of Yasir told police he had threatened to kill her multiple times and assaulted her when she was pregnant with their child, according to court documents. One threat the ex-girlfriend remembered and told police was that Yasir said he would pour gasoline on her mother’s house and burn it down. Police were called to an incident between Ibtihal and Yasir Darraji in early January. On Jan. 9, both Ibtihal and Yasir Darraji spoke with a Spokane County Sheriff’s deputy regarding an incident in which Ibtihal and her friend confronted Yasir and his friend about the men spreading rumors that Ibtihal was pregnant out of wedlock, according to court documents. Yasir recorded the conversation and complained to police that his ex-wife’s friend had assaulted him previously for spreading the rumors, court documents show. Deputies did not take any action other than council Ibtihal’s friend on her actions, court records say. The couple spent much of their lives living in Iraq, according to court documents. In their culture, court documents said the actions of Ibtihal would reflect poorly on Yasir, even after their divorce. This idea was confirmed by Ibtihal’s friend when she was interviewed by police. She told police that Yasir was angry with Ibtihal for going out to “nightclubs.” She also told police that Yasir wanted Ibtihal to leave their children with him and move back to Iraq, and that if she didn’t, Yasir said he would kill her.

"53",955,"https://southfront.org/iraqi-shiite-cleric-muqtada-al-sadr-escaped-us-assassination-plot/","Iraqi Shiite Cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr Reportedly Escaped US Assassination Plot","Support SouthFront Click to see full-size image The influential Iraqi Shiite Cleric Muqtada al-Sadr escaped an alleged US assassination plot, according to the leader of Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq Resistance Movement Qais Khazali. “The first US-Israeli plot to be implemented in Iraq was assassination of Muqtada Sadr to put the blame on Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq and start internal bloodshed,” Khazali said in a TV program named Liqa al-Khas. According to him, both al-Sadr and Iran were informed of the plot and it failed. In May 2018, al-Sadr’s Sairoon electoral list won 54 seats in the first Iraqi parliamentary election since the ISIS was declared defeated in Iraq. He is the most influential political figure in the country. He rejected US interference in the formation of the new Iraqi government, saying that “the US is an invader country; we do not allow it to interfere” in Iraqi affairs. Just days earlier, on February 2nd, he called for an end to the violence on Iraq’s streets, as more than 550 protesters have died in the demonstrations since they began in October 2019. Muqtada al-Sadr said in a tweet that in accordance with the recommendations of the supreme religious authority of Iraq (Marja) and in accordance with divine and rational laws, the street protests must return to its peaceful status and discipline. But he called for protests to continue, since he supports the incoming Prime Minister Mohammad Allawi, who is known for his strongly pro-Hezbollah views. Al-Sadr has called on his supporters named the “Blue Hats” to work with security forces to maintain peaceful protests in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. Sadr also emphasized the need to reopen schools in the southern and central provinces in collaboration with the tribes of those provinces and strongly opposed the violence and the closure of the streets under the pretext of street protests. Allawi, 65, is a veteran Iraqi politician who started his political career with the Iraqi Islamic Dawa Party before leaving the party. He was born in Baghdad, but he was forced to leave it in 1977, after being pursued by the Ba’ath government. Allawi is a cousin of the former Iraqi prime minister and secular politician Iyad Allawi, but he is also a relative of Sadr. Two of Allawi’s daughters are married to sons of Basil al-Sadr, Sadr’s cousin and director of foreign relations at the Sadr office in London. Allawi’s nomination “is a premeditated plan that started more than 40 days ago when the [Iranian-backed] political forces noticed that Sadr was convinced of Allawi’s nomination, so they sought to perpetuate and develop this conviction,” an unnamed Shiite leader from Iraq told Middle East Eye. “After the assassination of [Iranian General Qassem] Soleimani and [Abu Mahdi] al0-Muhandis, Iranian policy in Iraq has completely changed. Soleimani was working to exclude Muqtada and keep him away all the time, but now the situation has changed. “There is an Iranian tendency to contain Sadr and give him the role he desires. “The [armed] factions pledged allegiance to Sadr in Qom as leader of the resistance, and this was part of the implementation of this policy.” Initially al-Sadr supported the anti-government protests, but now that he supports the incoming Prime Minister, he maintains that peace should return to the streets and order should be reinstated. At the same time, he is a strong political figure, who, despite his view of a very independent Iraq is much more open to cooperate with regional actors such as Iran and Syria, rather than with the US, thus the claims of a possible assassination plot aren’t entirely out of the question. After all, al-Sadr strongly opposes any US presence, and the only option for Washington’s influence to grow is the remaining of its forces within the country. On the other hand, the US’ “nemesis” Iran has more interest in a strong and independent Iraq, which is open to constructive cooperation. MORE ON THE TOPIC: Support SouthFront SouthFront Sparse on the assassination attempt, but good background. Jew York Times even confirmed that the rocket attacks on Americunt occupation bases are false flags by CIA backed terrorists to blame the Iranians. All the US really succeeds in doing, is to unite political rivals who oppose the tyranny and plunder of the US. The Khazar 1% semites that control the US are making the same mistakes that they always have for centuries. When the Khazars ‘pluck the feathers ‘ of a country like Iraq, they take all the ‘feathers’ and the bald birds become hungry and angry. US diplomacy is so heinous that they only succeed in making their opponents look like reformers Its arguable that Diplomacy in the US was abandoned decades ago. Empires past and present have only issued Decrees, Demands and Denials, à la ‘Perfidious Albion’. CIA mystery: Did Iran kill ‘Ayatollah Mike?’ Nobody is talking after Michael D’Andrea, the CIA’s top Iran Mission Center chief, is allegedly killed in plane crash but eight new stars have appeared on the “wall of heroes” at the CIA headquarters at Langley. The White House and CIA have neither confirmed nor denied that it was, or if D’Andrea is alive or dead. Cue the media speculation. The former chief of the CIA’s Counter Terrorism Center, he was appointed to his current position by then Agency Director Mike Pompeo in 2017. The New York Times reported that his appearance would mean a much harder line in opposing Iran by the Trump administration, the report said 8 new stars on the wall of heroes!? sure as a klucking bell hope one pertains to this d’andrea guy (and just as much hope that it was in fact a close cooperation between Iran and the talibans that downed that bombardier -nothing could be sweeter) and the fact that the disunited states of morons is defeated in afghanistan is another thing to celebrate – all they’re doing now is to work out a honourable truce which the talibans won’t give them and then it’s the question how to get the stuff of tanks, guns etc back home now that most ways are closed for such transports. As I wrote a month ago the Americunts are trying to set off an internecine Shia conflict so that their savage occupation and oil plunder can continue. Now it has been proven by the western media that the rocked attack on the Balad airbase was conducted by CIA paid headchoppers to justify the assassination of General Soleimani. It will have the opposite effect though as all Shia and many patriotic Sunnis will unite and attack the Americunt occupation arseholes. The Americans are playing the fools again, trying to get everyone to believe it’s another well intentioned ‘mistake’. Thanks God, may the evil people behind these assassination plots meet their untimely ends not surprising since the disunited states of A is prone to resort to skulduggery when the influence it once wielded is disappearing down the drain – it’s the washington morons doing the dirty work of the illegal settlers on palestinian land and if an assassination or two is required so be it but rest assured that at the squatters or the jews will soon be a memory far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, here, in the middle east and in the far east. and by golly, the hymies, the kikes, the jews, the squatters won’t be missed by the greater part of humanity – might say they overstayed their welcome! Donald Trump is talking peace, but itching for war. That is how he hopes to sell to Americans the coming war with Iran. He will tell them he didn’t want a war, but could not do otherwise. He campaigned on a promise to pull troops for the middle east. Instead, he increased the number of troops and war machine to a greater extend than Obama did. His promise of peace and negotiation was a deception – a deception that will lead to war. It is good that Iran has prepared for war. Trumps finger is itching to pull the trigger just as he hesitates over the possible consequences. At some point, he will pull the trigger or be pushed to do so. If we make it through 2020 without a war, the middle east will be very lucky. Iran has taken the responsibility to rid the region of American presence. It had better be ready as the Americans are coming for them. But I think Iran will do very well, and the possibility of purging America from the region is very likely. Only that it is hard to see the U.S leave without dropping nukes on Iran. I agree on the nuke thing and israel will be there too with nukes – but given that iran is a vast place with loads of people even the nukes won’t change the situation and Iran will indeed lay waste to oil facilities in saudi and the uae and kuwait and close the hormuz strait for shipments out of there. trump however will wait for his second term before running amok in the middle east and there are two reasons, the first is oil since the new found shale-bonanza back home is a short lived phenomenon and thus iraq’s oil and any oil in the me (and venezuela) will be required in the future and the second is israel and the lebensraum extension of the borders into iraq (all the way to the Iranian border or thereabouts), into syria, into lebanon. the one problem here is Iran which has some severe opposing thoughts on the matter and turkey which consider those areas as a prerogative of turkey and not something the jews ever shall hold or occupy. thus too much open hostilities by the disunited states of A surely will force a joining up of iran and turkey and then iraq and syria hezbollah and so on. and after that it’s anyone’s guess. The only people you should trust less than the Turks and the Israelis are the Americans. Rusty Iron Dick is upset as you said the Yanks are less trustworthy than Israeli’s. I tend to agree with him as I think Israelis learnt from the yanks and got better at it than them. Ha, I don’t know…… When the Israelis backstab you, you think they’re being clever, when the US backstabs you, you think they’re doing because they are dumb. I think the lie goes deeper with the Americans because they pretend more. Not hard The Islamic State (IS) group has was paid by the CIA to stage the false flag that was used as the justification for the asassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force. Iraq Is the One War Zone Trump Doesn’t Want to Leave The president’s resistance to withdrawing from the country boils down to oil and Iran. The assassination of General Soleimani is part of the cycle of staged events used as a justification for the continued occupation of Iraq and rapid exploitation of its natural resources. Yes. Bad move guys. If the Americans wanted to kill him, he would be dead already. There have been rumors in the past that Iran wants to kill him. It seems that he will die at the age of 120 after every person who spreads rumors about him is already dead. If the US wanted to kill him,,,.. yes a bit like the only way the US could kill Osama bin Laden was when he had already been dead for years. No wonder they never flew his non existant body onto the US ship , sailors on board said NO chopper ever landed on their ship that night. , and disposed of it where no one can ever check.. Sadr has been fighting the US for years and got soundly thrashed in Fallujah was it. He ended up working out a peace deal with the US to end the fighting as he was serriously out gunned and out manned. Over 80 US dead and 600 wounded with around 2000 of Sadrs men killed . You left out the bit where the Seal team that “killed” “Bin Laden” were conveniently killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan shortly after. Yes all the Seal team on board one chopper against rules taken out by the Taliban who were then heard skiting over the radio they had just taken out the group that killed Obama. How did they know who was on board the chopper they had just shot down or were they told it was coming. Also missed the story about the neighbors who watched the event unfold from their rooftop ovelooking “Osama’s” compound. They heard the people on the chopper shouting in their local dialect which no Seal member knew , and that NO chopper took off from the compound and that they KNEW the people in that compound..as per a Pakistani TV interview made just after the ” raid” but has since msyteriously disappeared . Nor did I say anything about Benazir Bhutto who told David Frost I think it was , in an interview that Osama was already dead. She was assasinated in Dec 2007. ( not because of her interview ) Osama bin Laden was ” killed ” in that raid May 2011. Scratch head many times. Been looking for that video of Frosts interview and HELLO …. everything has been censored or blocked or removed. If it was a LIE why would anyone censor it. Truth is all that is censored. I watched it years ago so I know it exists or rather existed. Further research and I have found , but any video is blocked or removed. On 2 November 2007 Benazir Bhutto was interviewed by Sir David Frost at Al Jazeera shortly before her murder on 27 December 2007. In this interview she said: “And he had also dealings with Omar Sheik, the man who murdered Osama Bin Laden.” The same interview was published on the BBC website, but that key sentence was removed. Here is the transcript of this key passage: “Frost: In terms of the three people you mentioned – were they members of or associated with the government? Bhutto: Yes well one of them is a very key figure in security, a former military officer. He’s someone who has had dealings with ?? Mohammed, one of the band groups and Mohammed Assar, who was in an Indian jail for decapitating three British tourists and three American tourists. And he had also dealings with Omar Sheik, the man who murdered Osama Bin Laden” (see “BBC censors interview with Benazir Bhutto: … “the man who murdered Osama bin Laden” (2 versions)”: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3468310105875718252 ; also “BBC censors Bhutto Frost interview (Bin Laden murdered)”, YouTube, 31 December 2007: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGAOH_E3aQQ .

A chain-smoking convert to Islam, he is not your conventional Agency officer, many of whom are more comfortable working from an embassy desk rather than a helicopter. A workaholic who keeps a roll away bed in his office, D’Andrea is, as a result of his abrasive style, reportedly extremely difficult to work with. Whether he is alive or dead, the tale of his so-called death serves as a warning from Iran. Even an obstinate White House can’t help but think that killing men like Soleimani might not be such a great idea — if we continue to do it to “them,” “they” will turn around and “do it to us. With what a drone strike but then we wouldn’t be able to pin the blame on a rival political faction and provoke a larger Shiite response. For this operation, we’d have to use either a bullet or car bomb and rely on a local operative. This has a very high incidence of failure depending on how good the security is for the target. If the Iraqi population wants freedom and democracy they cant do it without Americans. The Iraqis have been in infights internally between each other and always quarrel about who are boss and who should have our old boots. Therefore it take so long because the Iraqis don’t yet have the intelligence to freedom. When you break it, you own it. If you can dream it, you can do it. That’s why we are responsible and promise the Iraqi people that we will not leave Iraq before all Iraqis have freedom, and they can trust America will provide security to all Iraqis as long as we are in the country.","none","none",1,2,0,0

Masrour Barzani, also the region’s security chief, said that the organization is “regrouping” and mounting attacks in northern and western Iraq. He spoke Saturday to The Washington Post on the sidelines of a security summit in the southern German city of Munich, where he said he had reiterated Kurdish concerns to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when they met a day earlier. “His killing has not weakened the ability of ISIS to operate,” Barzani said, using an acronym for the militant group, pointing to the ability of local cells to operate independently of the central leadership. “They have not stopped recruiting more people, they have not stopped attacking,” he added. Barzani’s warnings come against the background of his government’s efforts to urge the United States to find a way to maintain a troop presence in Iraq, amid political backlash in Baghdad over the Trump administration’s targeted killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil last month. White House memo on Soleimani strike makes no mention of imminent threat Soleimani’s slaying — which was precipitated by the death of an American contractor in an attack on an Iraqi military base hosting U.S. troops — escalated tensions in the region. Speaking at the security conference Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the American action had worked in Iran’s favor by increasing Iraqi discontent with the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. “Martyr Soleimani is much more effective than General Soleimani,” he said. NATO said this week that it will pick up some of the training activities in Iraq currently run by the U.S.-led coalition, but details of exact troop reorganization and numbers have not been worked out. “The militaries of the coalition and NATO will coordinate and determine how we can expand NATO’s efforts to support the Iraqi security services,” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said at a security summit on Friday. “It is imperative that we maintain unrelated pressure on ISIS in Iraq and Syria, just as we hope the Iraqis to do so in the long term,” he said. Although Iraq’s security forces are taking the lead on fighting the group, Iraqi and U.S. military officials say that coalition intelligence and aerial support remains crucial to the overall effort. Iraq announced earlier this month that the coalition had resumed operations alongside the country’s security forces, following a brief suspension in the wake of Soleimani’s killing. Western officials, along with some Iraqi officials, had raised concerns over the possibility that ISIS militants might take advantage of any disruption in the capacities arrayed against it. Since the fall of their caliphate last year, the Islamist militants have been mustering in ungoverned spaces that security forces struggle to penetrate — in Syria they are lying low in the desert, officials say. In Iraq, the largest group appears to be concentrated in the no man’s land between Kurdish security forces and those from federal Iraq. Kurdish commanders put the number of fighters there as high as 3,000, while the U.S. military believes it is closer to 500, operating in small cells and without close coordination. For the most part, their attacks have been small-scale, using rudimentary explosives, or taking opportunistic potshots at security forces as they pass. Barzani said that Islamic State attacks now exceed 60 a month, according to the regional government’s figures. “Now they are more acting as insurgents and as, you know, covert operations and mainly just trying to blend in,” he said. The coalition said earlier this month that the number of attacks claimed by the Islamic State in the final months of 2019 had roughly halved when compared to figures from the previous quarter. But it was unclear how many attacks the coalition had recorded in the opening months of 2020. Asked whether Baghdadi’s slaying had been seen to impact Islamic State morale, Barzani said “maybe at the beginning.” “But we haven’t seen any major change,” he said. Trump appears to confuse the Kurds of Syria and Iraq The Kurdish leader said he hoped that Washington and Baghdad can work out a mechanism for troop numbers to be maintained. “Anything that would allow and would permit the presence of this forces in the region, which we believe is essential in combating terrorism,” he said. The presence of European forces are “very much tied with the presence of the United States,” he said. On Soleimani’s killing Barzani said that “any sort of escalation of tension in the area is not helping the stability.” “We hope that all sides will think about de-escalating the confrontation and focus on fighting terrorism in the area, which should be the priority,” he said.

Taha A.-J. is the husband of Jennifer W., a woman who has been on trial in Munich since last year over accusations that the two mistreated a Yazidi mother and daughter, before allowing the young girl to die. The case against the couple has been described by media and lawyers as the first time worldwide that an ISIS member has been tried for crimes against the Yazidis, a religious minority which suffered brutal persecution at the hands of the Islamic State from 2014. Prosecutors allege that A.-J., who joined ISIS in 2013, purchased the Yazidi child and her mother as household “slaves” and held them captive while living with Jennifer W. in then ISIS-occupied Mosul, Iraq, in 2015. Their actions were aimed at “destroying the Yazidis, their religion and their culture in keeping with the aims of ISIS,” the prosecutors’ statement said. The couple are alleged to have forced the mother and daughter to convert to Islam, starved them of food and water and subjected them to beatings. A.-J. ultimately chained the five-year-old girl to a window outdoors in heat mounting to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), leading her to die of thirst, according to the case. “The accused thought it possible that the girl would die and recklessly took that into account,” prosecutors said. Arrested in Greece in May 2019 and in detention in Germany since October, A.-J. has also been charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and human trafficking for labour exploitation. Jennifer W. has been on trial in Munich since April. Recruited to ISIS in mid-2015, she was later arrested in Turkey and extradited back to Germany, but not convicted. She was arrested again in June 2018 after speaking about the Yazidi child’s death to an undercover police informant, who she believed would help her return to ISIS territory. Prominent London-based human rights lawyer Amal Clooney is part of the team representing the dead Yazidi girl’s mother, who is a co-plaintiff in the case. Clooney has been involved in a campaign with Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad, a former ISIS sex slave, to have the ISIS crimes against the Yazidi minority be recognized as a genocide.

In 2015 at least 70 people were killed in an air raid on the town of Hawija. The bomb was dropped by a Dutch plane. The victims are now suing the Dutch government for compensation. Could this set a precedent?   ""We hate the Netherlands for what happened,"" says Fatima Dawoud. Thirty-five members of her family were affected by the bomb that hit the city of Hawija, south-west of Kirkuk, in July 2015. Dutch media have established that a Dutch plane dropped the bomb as part of the operation of the international coalition against the Islamic terror group ""Islamic State"" (IS). All of the 20 or so men and women who have gathered in a cold room in Hawija's partly reconstructed town hall are victims of the air raid on an IS bomb factory. They survived the inferno that destroyed a large part of their town, but lost family members, homes and incomes. That's why they're demanding compensation from the Dutch government. They have brought pictures of their wounds suffered in the raid and talk about its disastrous effects. Mohammed Khalef lost his father. ""I was sleeping on the roof when our home partly collapsed. My parents were downstairs and were buried in the rubble."" The Iraqi government has done little to help the victims of the bomb blast ""Now my children are scared of anything they see or hear in the air,"" says Abdullah Ramadan, while a woman describes how her cousin went crazy. ""He eats washing powder. They have to tie him down."" Deadly chemical mix Many survivors complain about health issues resulting from the chemical mix released by the bomb. Fatima Dawoud's daughter has contracted cancer. ""We have no income, and we cannot pay for medication,"" says Dawoud. The bomb targeted a building IS was using as a bomb factory in an industrial compound enclosed on three sides by civilian neighborhoods. Three tanker lorries filled with explosives were parked there, ready to be used in an attack on the oil refinery at Baiji. A nearby warehouse was used to store the fertilizer IS used in its bomb production. Read more: 'Islamic State' sleeper cells spread fear in Iraq's Hawija The deadly mix killed at least 70 civilians. People as far as a kilometer away from the site died due to the shockwave that followed the enormous blast. ""People were sleeping outside, because of the heat. Some were thrown meters through the air by the force of the explosion,"" says Musa Jassam, the mayor of the Yarmouk neighborhood, which was the worst affected. Houses, shops, schools and hospitals were destroyed. Can the Netherlands be held to account? Four years after the raid, the exact number of victims is still unclear. The survivors are now looking to the Netherlands for compensation — the Iraqi government is not offering any. People not only lost their homes; they also lost their breadwinners and sources of income. Some 200 shops were destroyed in the attack. ""I have no windows, no doors and no money,"" one of the women says. ""The Dutch government has to help us."" A western country like the Netherlands should take responsibility for its actions, says Mohammed Mahmoud, the deputy mayor of Hawija. ""If you make a mistake, you try to make amends. In Iraq, in any accident or conflict, the person who is responsible pays."" That's why Al-Ghad, an NGO based in Kirkuk, has collected information from everyone present in the hall. So far, it has been able to document 50 cases out of a probable 300 eligible survivors, says its director, Tofan Awad. ""Many have come forward, but we have to check everything. Which is not easy, as much of the evidence has gone. In 2015, there were no state hospitals in Hawija, and no legal local government."" Read more: Is the 'Islamic State' making a comeback in Iraq? If the Iraqi victims win their case against the Netherlands, it could could create a major precedent IS did not allow any phones, so pictures are rare. ""The injured are the toughest cases, as they had nowhere to go and have no documents. They think their scars should be evidence enough, but they are not,"" says Awad. Al-Ghad will hand the files to the office of Liesbeth Zegveld, a Dutch lawyer who specializes in compensation cases like this one. She plans to use two of the most compelling cases to file a claim against the Dutch Ministry of Defense for accountability. One case involves a family that lost a mother and five children in the attack. However, Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld has told the Dutch Parliament that the Iraqi authorities are responsible for covering the damage, as they invited the coalition to Iraq to fight IS. The minister has announced that she will soon make a decision on whether to open a special aid fund for the victims of Hawija, as ""a gesture of good will."" A precedent in the making? ""That will be too much like development aid,"" Zegveld says, ""while it should be about taking responsibility for one's actions."" She points out that, according to the coalition forces, all members are equally responsible for the casualties. Apart from two Dutch air raids — the one on Hawija plus another on Mosul — it's not clear what other countries' planes were involved in the thousands of strikes on IS targets. But she agrees that if the details of other bombings were also to be unveiled, a Dutch conviction could create an important precedent, possibly inspiring journalists and NGOs to investigate and initiate liability cases in other countries, too. Read more: Opinion: 'Islamic State' may fall, but will not vanish The Dutch authorities have declared that they cannot be held accountable, since the enormous damage was caused as a result of inaccurate information provided by others. ""If a mistake is made because there were more explosives than expected, the liability lies with the Dutch,"" says Zegveld.

Photo: Kalak’s FB video MADINA, Saudi Arabia,— An elderly man who appeared in a divine healing video that landed a controversial Kurdish cleric in Saudi authority detention earlier this week has branded the cleric a “liar”. Mullah Ali Kalak, more widely known as Mala Ali Kurdistani, published a video on Facebook on Sunday in which he purportedly heals an elderly man of blindness in the holy Saudi city of Medina. The mullah licks his index finger with his tongue and places it on both of the man’s eyes, before reading a chapter from the Quran. Seconds later, the elderly man claims he has regained his sight. But in a viral clip broadcast by regional TV channels on Wednesday, the man, who Saudi police stated as being of Pakistani origin, dismissed Kalak as a “liar”. In the video, filmed at a mosque, the elderly man is asked by someone sitting with him how he was healed – to which he replies “I did not tell him that I was blind … I swear by Allah he is a liar.” Both say Allah alone has the power to heal people, and pray for the Mullah to guided by Allah to the right path. However, in the healing video posted by Mullah Ali on Sunday, the man can be heard saying he had been blind for ten years. Kalak, who was released from Saudi detention on Wednesday, has long garnered controversy through videos which purportedly show him healing sick, possessed and disabled people using Quranic verses. He appeared in a video on his official page on Facebook on Wednesday, dismissing claims he stages the healings as “untrue”. The mullah called for an apology from Kurdish news outlets for publicizing his arrest, whose occurrence he neither confirmed nor denied. He insisted on the authenticity of his act of healing, claiming it was one unprecedented in the holy city. “The healing of blind and mute people in Medina has never happened before,” he said. However, he has always insisted that his power to heal is not self-sourced, but divine. Kalak previously ran a healing center in his Iraqi Kurdistan Region hometown of Kalak, 40 kilometers from Erbil. The center was repeatedly closed down by the government, a Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) health official told Rudaw English. He faced multiple arrests and court summons from KRG officials for his practice. Kurdish Islamic Mullah Ali Kalak (Ali Kurdistani) known as the “fake healer”, drinking camel urine for its supposed health benefits in the United Arab Emirates, January 2020. Photo: Ekurd.net/Kalak’s FB video Kalak said in another Sunday video that he had moved permanently to the Gulf after the clampdown on his practice by Iraqi Kurdistan authorities. A video shared by Kalak in January 2020 showing him drinking camel urine and milk for its supposed health benefits in the United Arab Emirates has garnered 3 million views on Facebook. In 2015 Kalak has published on his page in social networking site (Facebook) that a mixture of milk and camel urine is the best treatment for cancers, hepatitis and AIDS calling the citizens of the region to raise camels for this purpose. Kalak also promotes female genital mutilation in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Mullah was openly calling on people to break Kurdistan law. FGM is illegal in Iraqi Kurdistan since 2011 when the government passed law No. 8 against domestic violence including FGM.

"63",1094,"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-new-prime-minister-1.5448902","Iraqi factions select new PM-designate after weeks of jockeying | CBC News","Former communications minister Mohammed Allawi was named prime minister-designate by rival Iraqi factions Saturday after weeks of political deadlock, three officials said. The choice comes as the country weathers troubled times, including ongoing anti-government protests and the constant threat of being ensnared by festering U.S.-Iran tensions. The selection of Allawi, 66, to replace outgoing Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi was the product of many backroom talks over months between rival parties. On Wednesday, President Barham Saleh gave parliamentary blocs until Feb. 1 to select a premier candidate, or said he would exercise his constitutional powers and choose one himself. In a pre-recorded statement posted online, Allawi called on protesters to continue with their uprising against corruption and said he would quit if the blocs insist on imposing names of ministers. ""If it wasn't for your sacrifices and courage there wouldn't have been any change in the country,"" he said addressing anti-government protesters. ""I have faith in you and ask you to continue with the protests."" Allawi was born in Baghdad and served as communications minister first in 2006 and again between 2010-2012. He resigned from his post after a dispute with former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Parliament is expected to put his candidacy to a vote in the next session, after which point he has 30 days to formulate a government program and select a cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, a replacement for Abdul-Mahdi should have been identified 15 days after his resignation in early December. Instead, it has taken rival blocs nearly two months of jockeying to select Allawi as their consensus candidate. Abdul-Mahdi's rise to power was the product of a provisional alliance between parliament's two main blocs — Sairoon, led by cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and Fatah, which includes leaders associated with the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units headed by Hadi al-Amiri. In the May 2018 election, neither coalition won a commanding plurality, which would have enabled it to name the premier, as stipulated by the Iraqi constitution. To avoid political crisis, Sairoon and Fatah forged a precarious union with Abdul-Mahdi as their prime minister. Until Allawi's selection, al-Sadr had rejected the candidates put forward largely by Fatah, officials and analysts said. Sairoon appears to have agreed to his candidacy following a tumultuous two week after the radical cleric held an anti-U.S. rally attended by tens of thousands and withdrew support for Iraq's mass anti-government protest movement, only to reverse the decision later. ""Sairoon has approved and Fatah has approved,"" a senior Iraqi official said. If elected by parliament, Allawi will have to contend with navigating Iraq through brewing regional tensions between Tehran and Washington. Tensions skyrocketed after a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad's airport killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The tumultuous event brought Iraq close to the brink of war and officials scrambling to contain the fallout. The presence of U.S. troops on Iraqi soil has become the focus of Iraqi politics in the wake of the strike. Parliament passed a non-binding resolution for their ouster and Abdul-Mahdi had openly supported withdrawal. Abdul-Mahdi's resignation was precipitated by ongoing mass protests in Baghdad and southern Iraq. Protesters are calling for new executive leadership, snap elections and electoral reforms. They have said they would not accept a candidate chosen by the political establishment. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Wissam and his family, like many thousands of Christian families who live on the Nineveh Plains, fled the 2014 ISIS invasion of the region and spent several years living in Erbil, Kurdistan. He spoke with Aid to the Church in Need: “Everyone here knows that August 6, 2014 was a dark and painful day in Iraqi Christian history: we were subjected to violence, persecution, and forced displacement at the hands of ISIS. Those who could not escape remained in its grip. My family and I were lucky. We fled, leaving our possessions and money behind. We clung to our faith and asked Jesus for help. “Our first stop was a hosting station in Kurdistan. We stayed there until we could find a more suitable place to live; we later moved to Erbil so I could finish my studies. In 2017, I graduated from the University of Mosul—which had a facility in Erbil—with a degree in Business Administration. “Hope still exists for us. Terrorists were expelled from the Nineveh Plains, so we were able to return to our home despite the damage done to it. In any case, we could not have stayed in Kurdistan, where the cost of living is too high and we could not find steady employment there. “Ba’ashiqah is currently stable, and we have the protection of the Iraqi army and the local police force. But we still feel insecure in many ways. There is no justice or equality for Christians here; unemployment rates are high here, too. And the ISIS occupation has left a legacy of distrust between Christians and Muslims in the region. “I would prefer emigrating today. I’m a university graduate but I am making just $200 a month working in a juice shop. My ambition was to get a government position and to have a chance at a stable job “The future is unknown and that does frighten me. The country is going through endless conflicts; and the power of militia and the influence of Iran rob Iraq of its sovereignty. We have been persecuted for our faith and will likely continue to be. But we remain attached to our faith at all costs and hope that peace will prevail in the end. I hope that future generations of Christians can fulfill their responsibility to build a stable Iraqi society, one in which Christians can play a significant role. “Meanwhile, I am grateful for the Church and the various youth programs it runs, teaching the faith as well as basic computer skills and English. That is helping keep hope alive for young Iraqi Christians.” —Ragheb Elias Karash . . . . 725 Leonard Street | P.O.

"68",1256,"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1722317,00.html","Death Comes for an Iraqi Archbishop","Chaldean Catholic archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho Follow @TIME Pope Benedict XVI has repeatedly worried out loud about the fate of Christian minorities in the Islamic world. He's complained that churches can't be built in many Muslim countries. He warned of a mass exodus of his ancient Catholic flock from places like Beirut and Bethlehem. Now, the Pope has a martyred Iraqi bishop to lament. Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Mosul, Paulos Faraj Rahho was kidnapped on Feb. 29. On Thursday, his body was recovered. Almost immediately, the Pontiff released a blunt statement, declaring: ""the most resolute condemnation of an act of inhuman violence that offends the dignity of the human being."" Several Catholic priests and seminarians have been killed in previous attacks and kidnappings over the past three years in Iraq, but Rahho is the first bishop to perish after being caught up in that country's cycle of violence. The body of the bearded 65-year-old, who was known to be in poor health, was found after his abductors called Rahho's church to say that he'd died and been buried. His corpse was found in a shallow grave just outside Mosul. The cause of death was not immediately clear. Still, there is little doubt about the religious motivation of last month's brazen abduction, in which Rahho's driver and two bodyguards were slain. Even if criminal elements were involved in the kidnapping  and ransoms were reportedly sought  the victim was clearly targeted for his prominent role in the Church. Mosul is the capital of Ninevah Province and home to most of Iraq's Assyrian Christian community, which swears allegiance to the Pope in Rome. Iraqi Christians have faced difficult circumstances since the U.S. invasion in 2003. Viewed by jihadist insurgents as natural allies of the American ""crusaders,"" Christians were subjected to threats and a wave of church bombings early in the war. They faced similar violence from Shi'ite militias enforcing a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Some liquor stores  which are mostly Christian-owned since Islam forbids drinking alcohol  were bombed; many others closed or went underground. The strain on Iraq's Christians was evident last Christmas at the Assyrian Catholic Church in the Karrada neighborhood of Baghdad. The previous year, Christmas 2006, Baghdad was wracked by violence and mass was poorly attended. Security improved dramatically at the end of last year, and Christmas drew a crowd that overflowed the pews and left worshippers standing in the back of the church. But it is still a community under siege. Leila Najib, who attended mass with her husband and children, said that many of her fellow worshippers had recently moved to Karrada from other parts of Baghdad. Karrada is one of the last neighborhoods in Baghdad with a significant Christian population. Christians in Baghdad neighborhoods like Dora have fled to Karrada, and may never return to their former homes. Even amid the relative peace brought by the U.S. military surge, Iraq's Christians still do not feel they can turn to the government for protection, or to safeguard their way of life. They fear that the Shi'ite-dominated government will only strengthen the hand of conservative Muslim groups hostile to Christians. ""Security is a little better  not great,"" said Najib. Catholic leaders in Rome and Iraq have decried what they see as a systematic attempt by radical Islamic groups to drive out Christians from Iraq, where their ancestry can be traced to the very origins of the faith. ""The persecution of Christians in Iraq has been intensifying for the past two years,"" said Roberto Fontolan, the Rome-based editor of Oasis, a Catholic publication focused on the plight of Christians in Muslim-majority countries. ""After all the alarms and condemnations, we have yet another tragic turn."" Oasis reported recently that as many as 350,000 of the 800,000 Christians in Iraq before the war have since fled the country. In Baghdad, Najib, like many of her fellow worshippers, said that even improved security would not tempt the many Christians who have fled the countryto come home. Several Christians at mass that day said they were planning their own departures from Iraq. ""Nobody,"" Najib said, ""will come back."" Relations with Muslims have become a central theme under Benedict's papacy. His provocative 2006 speech in Germany about faith and reason sparked widespread protest in the Muslim world. Still, clumsy as it may have been, the attempt by the theologically-driven Pope to sharpen the debate about religious roots of violence seems to be bearing some fruit. A back-and-forth between prominent Muslim and Christian clerics has begun, including a letter last year from 138 prominent Islamic scholars offering to step up dialogue. Last month, Vatican officials announced that they would host the first in a series of high-level meetings with Muslims next November, where the Pope will appear. Under John Paul II, the Vatican had been somewhat more careful in its approach to the Muslim world, often accepting limited worshipping rights in exchange for security assurances. Benedict instead has pushed repeatedly for ""reciprocity,"" that is to demand that the same religious freedoms that Muslims enjoy in the West be granted for Christians in Muslim dominated countries. But Fontolan said, despite the signs of progress among the theologians, there is little concrete evidence ""on the ground"" of progress from the ruling authorities. ""On religious liberty, I don't see any steps forward,"" he said. ""We try and retry."" As extremists have gained prominence and power in the Muslim world since Sept. 11 and the onset of the Iraq war, pressure has increased on those forces hoping to guarantee basic rights and security of minority faiths. Catholic Church officials had long looked to Lebanon as a potential model for religious diversity in the Arab world. But, says Fontolan, ""I don't see much hope there now either."" Lebanon has recently been wracked by sectarian conflict among its Christian, Druze and Sunni and Shi'a Muslim citizens. The Pope no doubt will mourn his martyred bishop at Sunday's Angelus prayer in St. Peter's Square. And next month, there is another appointment on his schedule where he may very well worry out loud about Christians in the Middle East: his visit to the White House and President George Bush, the man who brought about the Iraq war.

Previously deployed to shield demonstrators against draconian crackdowns led by Iranian-sponsored militias, the Blue Hats had recently turned against the same protesters they were originally commissioned to protect. The violence culminated last Wednesday evening, 6 February, when a contingent of Blue Hats attacked an encampment of demonstrators in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, setting their tents ablaze and firing on them, killing 11. Condemnation against the brutality of Sadr’s militia swelled the ranks of protesters the following day across country, forcing the fiery cleric to publicly declare that he had dissolved the force less than a week later.

Learn more about how you can pray and partner with us in this worthy endeavor. The rise and fall of the Blue Hats is just the latest chapter in the strange and tragic saga of the Iraqi street protest movement. Led mostly by Shi’a youth in the nation’s south, the protests broke out spontaneously on October 1 of last year. Fueled by growing discontent with government corruption, lack of employment and basic services, demonstrators were openly critical of Iranian influence in Iraqi politics. Iran, also embroiled in a brutal crackdown against its own street protest movement at home, sent elements of their Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to advise the Iraqi government and the powerful Iraqi militias which it sponsors, such as Kataib Hezbollah and the Badr Brigades. The militias, which were originally organized in 2014 to counteract the expansion of ISIS, have since been integrated into the Iraqi army, with many Iranian-linked militia leaders holding powerful positions in the military hierarchy. Despite long-standing ties with Iranian clerics that predate the 2003 Iraq War, Muqtada al-Sadr initially styled himself as an Iraqi nationalist in support of the street protests, putting him at odds with his Iranian benefactors. He decried all foreign influences, including Iran, but especially the US-led Coalition. He hoped to ride the wave of grassroots anger and steer it against Western intervention in Iraq. However, the death of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah leader Abu Mahdi al-Mandis on 3 January was a turning point for the Iraqi cleric. After the death of their master strategist and faced with a growing protest movement that would not be stamped out by violent tactics, the Iranians were forced to reconsider their strategy in Iraq. They began wooing al-Sadr back into their fold in mid-January. SERVE THE KURDS IN IRAQ Click on the graphic to learn more about our Pesengi immersion courses available this year. By the end of last month, al-Sadr had reconciled with the Iranian government and formed a parliamentary bloc with pro-Iranian Shi’a parties to appoint Mohammad Allawi as the new Iraqi prime minister. Allawi, who has close ties with Iran, was immediately rejected by the protest movement as a step backwards, putting the movement at odds with al-Sadr. Relations between the Sadrists and the demonstrators broke down quickly, with Sadr’s militiamen taking over the “Turkish Restaurant” in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square on 2 February, recognized as the hub of the protest movement. The massacre in Najaf came just a few days later. Despite his pivot back towards Iran, al-Sadr continues to thread the needle. His office demanded Tuesday that the newly-appointed prime minister form a government and present it to the Iraqi parliament by 2 March or “face hell.” Muqtada continues to speak out in public support of demonstrators who are still taking to the streets daily across Iraq, while at the same time he is facilitating a political agenda that runs contrary to their demands. But political hedging and opportunism are nothing new for al-Sadr, who has a long history of chameleon tactics that stretch back to the early years of the Iraq War. During those years, he acted the firebrand by opposing US presence in Iraq and facilitating deadly, Iranian-orchestrated attacks on US forces while also portraying himself as a statesman and a unifying figure in Iraqi society. Now, with Iraq more divided than ever, al-Sadr’s political clout in Baghdad is the strongest it has ever been.

Poll Will you take the vaccine?  View Results Copyright © 2022 Arab America posted on: Feb 12, 2020 By: Ala Abed-Rabbo/Arab America Contributing Writer Iraqi Maqam is a type of Arab maqam music found in Iraq that is around four-hundred years old. The collection of instruments used in this kind of music, called Al-Chalghi al-Baghdadi, includes a qari’ (vocalist), tabla, santur, jawza, or dunbug/dumbeg, and occasionally, riqq and naqqarat. Moreover, the emphasis is on the poem resonated in classical Arabic or an Iraqi dialect (then known as zuhayri). A comprehensive maqam concert is recognized as fasl (plural fusoul) and is dubbed after the first Maqam: Bayat, Rast, Hijaz, Nawa, or Husayni. Also, the Maqam is the traditional singing folklore of Iraq and one of the most sophisticated of the many maqam rituals found throughout the Muslim and Arab and World. In Iraq, such type of music refers to highly structured, semi-spontaneous, masterpieces that take years of systematic study under a master to learn thoroughly. Repeatedly rhythmically free and contemplative, they are sung to Classical Arabic and conversational Iraqi poetry and are supported by light-hearted, musical songs, known as pestaat.  Maqam is primarily used in Iraqi cities, such as Baghdad, Mosul, Kirkuk, and Basra. Throughout history, the Iraqi maqam range draws upon musical types of the many populations in Iraq, such as the Bedouins, rural Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmen, Persians, Turks, and other people that have had broad contact with the country. Also, up until the 20th century, the Maqam was omnipresent in the urban regions of present-day Iraq; its piece of music heard in a variety of settings. For instance, in religious contexts, maqam tunes were used to call people for prayer, celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammed or another Holy person, as well as in Qur’ anic recitation. Maqam was also performed in the houses of athletes (zurkhanes) to motivate the contributors doing physical activity. Street retailers would also sing such music to advertise their products. Rituals often influenced which sorts of sellers would sing specific phrases. Proper maqam concerts took place in secluded homes during celebrations and in gahawi (coffeehouses), which were the main venues for the performances. In Baghdad, numerous coffee places focused on Maqam. Such locations include Gahwat Shaabander, Gahwat al-Qaysariya, and Gahwat ‘Azzawi. These places operated both as performing sites as well as organizations where the Maqam was broadcasted. Professionals, amateurs, and learners, known cooperatively as “ushshaaq al-maqam,” (lovers of the Maqam), would sit for hours, theorizing about the inner meanings of its melody.  A Qari or Al Qurra were known as the leading performer(s) as they recited during maqams. The term qari’, which is the equivalence used for a Qur’an reciter, is to highlight the religious nature of the maqam and to raise such a reputation higher than of others, lighter vocal varieties, which were not conducted in such regard. Moreover, the qurra’ were typically craftsmen or vendors that come from the lower levels of Baghdadi society, for whom they did not sing full-time. Most did not have proper schooling, and some were even uneducated, yet they were wizards of a highly intelligent, intricate vocal form, which could be achieved only after years of meticulous and intense work. Also, such a population acquire an in-depth understanding of Arabic poetry, from which they would select lines to perform to a maqam. When singing a maqam, the qari’ would enter a state of deep sacred excitement, which would circulate to the listeners in the room, who would often share manifestations of delight and joy, participating in interaction and exchange of sentiment with the musicians. During a performance, a four-piece ensemble accompanied by the reciter, known as a chalghi Baghdadi, contained of a jowza (a four-stringed point-fiddle that has a coconut shell resonator), a santur (a box-zither with brace cords, played with wooden sticks), a dumbug (goblet-shaped drum), a riqq (tambourine), and naqqarat (two small kettle drums played with sticks). The Baghdadi maqam arrangement involves around 100 pieces of music, each of which has a distinctive name, and to which often attributes to some other element; an association with a geographic territory, a community, an ancient event, or person, or other facets of Iraqi society. These melodies are presented in a musically free and semi-makeshift approach, with enough room for understanding, embellishment, and change, such that every concert is exclusive. Each vocalist is supposed to create a personal approach to singing these tunes. Each song in a maqam piece serves as one of six fundamental factors that make up its’ form. These pieces are the Tahrir, which is the introductory melody/main theme that is repeated throughout the maqam; qita’ and awsal (wusla), or subordinate melodies, which establish the building blocks of the composition. Also, the meyana, (climax,) is regularly a qita‘a or a wusla sung in the high record; a tiny cadence known as a Jelsa, which go before the meyana; a qarar, or a lineage into the lower register; and the teslim, which is the last, concluding cadence that gestures the end of the maqam and the coming pesteh (distinct later). Maqams start with a Tahrir and finish with a teslim and include one or more among the rest of the structural pieces. Some maqamat follow a preset cycle of melodies that each performer is following, although others have a relatively free form. “In practice, maqams are not performed in all chromatic keys, and are more rigid to transpose than scales in Western music, primarily because of the technical limitations of Arabic instruments.”  Check out our Blog here!

The meetings were meant to coordinate the political efforts of Iraq’s often-fractious militias, which lost not only Soleimani but also Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a unifying Iraqi paramilitary commander, in the Jan. 3 attack at Baghdad airport, the sources said. While offering few details, two additional sources in a pro-Iranian regime’s regional alliance confirmed that Hezbollah, which is sanctioned as a terrorist group by the United States, has stepped in to help fill the void left by Soleimani in guiding the militias. All sources in this article spoke on condition of anonymity to address sensitive political activities rarely addressed in public. Officials with the governments of Iraq and Iran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the militia groups. The discussions shed light on how Iran and its allied groups are trying to cement control in the unstable Middle East, especially in the wake of the devastating US attack on a revered Iranian military leader. The Tehran-backed militias are critical to Iran’s efforts to maintain control over Iraq, where the US still maintains some 5,000 troops. The country has experienced years of civil war since US forces toppled Saddam Hussein and more recently, the government - and the militias - have faced growing protests against Iran’s influence in the country. Iranian regime helped found some Iraqi militia groups. In the months ahead of his death, Soleimani had waded ever deeper into the Iraq crisis, holding meetings with the Iraqi militias in Baghdad as Tehran sought to defend its allies and interests in its power struggle with the United States, one of the two Iraqi sources said. Hezbollah’s involvement marks an expansion of its role in the region. The Shi’ite group, founded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) in 1982, has been at the heart of Iran’s regional strategy for years, helping Soleimani to train paramilitary groups in both Iraq and Syria. One pro-Iran regional official said Hezbollah’s guidance of the militias would continue until the new leadership in the Quds Force – a unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Soleimani since 1998 – gets a handle on the political crisis in Iraq. The meetings between Hezbollah and Iraqi militia leaders began in January, just days after Soleimani’s assassination, the two Iraqi sources said. Reuters couldn’t confirm the number of meetings or where they took place. One source said they were in Beirut and the other said they were either in Lebanon or Iran. Sheikh Mohammad al-Kawtharani, the Hezbollah representative in Iraq who worked closely with Soleimani for years to guide the Iraqi militias, hosted the meetings, the Iraqi sources said. Kawtharani picked up where Soleimani left off, the Iraqi sources said. The sources said Kawtharani berated the groups, as Soleimani had done in one of his final meetings with them, for failing to come up with a unified plan to contain popular protests against the Baghdad government and the paramilitaries that dominate it. The government and militia groups have killed hundreds of protesters but not managed to contain the rebellion. Kawatharani also urged a united front in picking a new Iraqi prime minister, the Iraqi sources said. Since then, former Iraqi communications minister Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi has been named - a development welcomed by Iran and accepted by the militia-linked parties it backs but opposed by protesters. BIG SHOES TO FILL For now, Kawtharani is seen as the most suitable figure to direct Iraqi militias until a permanent Iranian successor can be chosen, although he possesses nowhere near Soleimani’s clout and charisma, according to the two Iraqi sources and a senior Iraqi Shi’ite leader. “Kawtharani has connections with the militia groups,” the Shi’ite leader said, noting that he was born in Najaf, lived in Iraq for decades and speaks Iraqi dialect. “He was trusted by Soleimani, who used to depend and call on him to help him in crises and in meetings in Baghdad.” One of the Iraqi sources close to the militias said that Kawtharani also met with the Iraqi populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a powerful but unpredictable figure, to convince him to support the new Iraqi prime minister. As Reuters has reported, Sadr has given Allawi his support. Kawtharani will face serious - perhaps insurmountable- challenges in filling the shoes of the leaders killed in the drone attack, the Iraqi sources close to the militias told Reuters. “A lot of faction leaders see themselves as too big and important to take orders from “ one Iraqi source said. “For now, because of pressure from Iran, they’re cooperating with him, but I doubt that will continue and the Iranians know that.” One of the pro-Iran sources, a military commander, said Hezbollah’s involvement would consist of political guidance but stop short of providing manpower and materiel to retaliate for the Solemani killing. The militias “do not need Hezbollah’s intervention because they have the strength in numbers, combat experience and firepower,” the commander said. Those groups are difficult to control while Hezbollah is seen as more disciplined. But like the rest of Iran’s network, Hezbollah risks stretching itself thin, a senior US official in the region and an Iraqi political leader said. In recent years, Hezbollah’s role has grown considerably. It has fought in support of Bashar Assad in Syria. Iranian regime is likely to rely partly on the clout Nasrallah, a figure who commands deep respect among Iran’s allies across the region, the US official said. Nasrallah is seen as overseeing Kawtharani’s efforts, according to a senior Shi’ite Iraqi leader. “I think ideologically, religiously, he’s seen as a charismatic figure to many of the Iraqi Shia militias,” the US official said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. In two lengthy televised addresses, Nasrallah has paid homage to Soleimani and vowed to avenge his death. He has also declared it a goal of Hezbollah and its allies to eject US forces from the region once and for all. US forces have been in Iraq since 2014 as part of a coalition fighting against ISIS. If the Iraqi militias have their way, sources close to them say, these troops will be the first to depart. Based on Reuters ","none","none",1,1,0,0

Iraq: Al-Sadr supporters shoot fire to disperse Karbala protesters Eyewitnesses stated that the supporters of the Sadrist movement’s leader, Muqtada Al-Sadr, fired live bullets on Thursday to disperse protesters in the city of Karbala in southern Iraq. The eyewitnesses also told Anadolu Agency that dozens of Al-Sadr supporters known as “blue hats” stormed Al-Tarbiyah Square in the middle of Al-Tarbiyah City and attacked the protesters. They added that Al-Sadr supporters carried batons and machine guns, and they fired live bullets in the air to disperse the protesters, amid clashes with them. Many demonstrators fled for fear of killing. The eyewitnesses further stated that Al-Sadr supporters toppled the platform where the protesters used to express their positions for months in Al-Tarbiyah Square. The “blue hats” members have launched an organised campaign, since Monday, to disperse the crowds of protesters in the country’s central and southern cities and towns using excessive force, following the orders of Al-Sadr. Russia: Israeli attack in Syria almost killed civilian airplane The Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow claimed that the Israeli attack on Syria, which killed at least 23 pro-Iranian gunmen in the middle of Wednesday night, put a civilian flight with 172 passengers on board at risk, according to Yediot Aharonot. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least three government Iranian positions near Damascus and west of the capital were targeted. Syria’s official SANA news agency said the Israeli strikes came in two waves and hit the al-Kiswah area as well as Marj al-Sultan and Jisr Baghdad. The first wave at 1:12 a.m. “targeted some of our military positions in the suburbs of Damascus,” SANA quoted a military source as saying. The second wave at 1:41 a.m. “targeted military positions in the surroundings of Dara’a, Quneitra and Damascus countryside with a number of missiles fired by Israeli warplanes from the airspace in southern Lebanon and the occupied Golan.” According to the Russian statement, F-16 jets belonging to the Israeli Air Force (IAF) shot eight air-to-ground missiles without entering Syrian airspace. Moscow blamed Israel for using the civilian aircraft “as a shield against Syrian anti-aircraft systems.” Read more: Russian military specialists killed; Haftar receives Chinese drones; IDF strikes Hamas targets Read more: Military and defense analyzes, comments, opinions and rating – Defweek.com Follow us everywhere and at any time.

Security forces fired live rounds to disperse crowds at the rally site near the al-Ain University in the southern city of Nasiriyah, killing a demonstrator, two medical officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The latest death comes as the anti-government protests, which engulfed Baghdad and Iraq's south in October, are at a key point as activists are trying to maintain a critical number of people on the street and tensions continue to escalate between the demonstrators and the followers of a leading radical Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Nasiriyah has emerged as a frequent flashpoint of protest violence. At least eight protesters were killed in the southern city of Najaf last Wednesday, when followers of al-Sadr stormed the protest site and fired live bullets. Al-Sadr initially threw his weight behind the anti-government uprising but recently re-positioned himself toward the political establishment after political elites selected Mohammed Allawi as prime minister-designate, a candidate he endorsed. Since then, al-Sadr has issued a dizzying array of contradictory calls to followers, asking them to return to the streets, days after withdrawing support from the protests. His conflicting calls have exacerbated existing tensions between anti-government demonstrators and the cleric's followers. Anti-government protesters who took to the streets last October in Baghdad and southern Iraq to decry rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment, have rejected Allawi’s candidacy. At least 500 have died under fire from security forces in the movement, now in it’s fifth month. On Sunday, Baghdad University students held national flags during a protest in front of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in the Iraqi capital.

On Thursday, February 6, 2020, in the Kalar district under Kurdistan Region’s Germian administration, Wadi organization with the help of Netherland Consulate arranged a conference on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FMG in which they announced that Germian region is free of FGM. Based on their statistics, in 2019, no cases of FMG was recorded in Germain, however, 161 and 162 cases were recorded in Erbil and Ranya, respectively. In 2018, 29 cases were recorded in the Gemian Region. Wadi launched Stop FMG campaign in Germian and some other areas in 2015. Iman Nuri, a member of a Wadi mobile team in Germian, said, “Wadi efforts to combat FMG has continued for 15 years in Germian, Erbil, Halabja, and Ranya and now Germian is free of FMG.” Wadi helps any villages or areas free of FMG with services and projects that are in its capacity. “It is a historic and happy day for all people of Germian because they are pioneer in zeroing FMG. This is an achievement and an honor. We hope that the other areas will take the same step,” Iman added. Iman mentioned that After declaring that Germian is free of FMG, Wadi’s further efforts will be working on eliminating the effects of FMG and the issues that emerges from it. Ending FMG in Ranya, Erbil and Halabja will be another project that the organization will work on in the future with the support of Netherland Consulate in Erbil. Kurdistan Region’s parliament law number 8 of 2011 is helpful to end FMG as it bans it and sets punishment for it.

The step shows that while the Iraqí leadership's demands for an immediate removal of American forces have cooled, they are serious about rethinking the strategic relationship, and this is directly affecting military cooperation. Officially, Iraqis have been unclear on the status of joint operations. The Iraqi military announced Jan. 30 that they had resumed after a three-week halt, but that statement was later removed and a military spokesperson rescinded the claim in remarks to state television. It was not followed up with a clarification. The halt had been called amid soaring tensions following the Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad. On at least two occasions in January, U.S. officials said they expected the pause would be lifted imminently. But in practice, Iraqis are seeking to minimize cooperation with the anti-IS coalition, based on government orders, two Iraqi military officials and one militia official said this week. “After the killing of Soleimani, the Iraqi government decided to inform us formally not to cooperate and not to seek assistance from the U.S.-led international coalition in any operation,” a senior military intelligence official told The Associated Press. “Until now, we have not asked the Americans to provide assistance, we rely on our capabilities to pursue IS elements. The presence of the Americans in the joint operations is only formal,"" the official said. The three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters. The coalition paused its mission to fight IS in Iraq on Jan. 5 after the strike. That same day, Shiite lawmakers, irate over what they called a flagrant violation of sovereignty, passed a nonbinding resolution requesting the government cancel legal agreements that provide the basis for the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Outgoing Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi has stated publicly that U.S. troops must go, but he has stepped back from unilaterally canceling existing agreements, saying the matter was up to the next prime minister to decide. Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi has not made his policy known toward the troop presence. About 5,200 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Iraqi bases to support local troops fighting IS militants. They are part of a larger international coalition invited by the Iraqi government in 2014. One of the officials, a commander in Iraq's elite U.S.-trained Counter-Terrorism Services in western Anbar province, said some training continues, but “as for military operations and carrying out operations, there is no support.” “We have knowledge that the American support to the Iraqi forces has stopped,” said the commander of an Iranian-backed militia group. No coalition airstrikes have been carried out against IS since the killing of Soleimani, said coalition spokesman Myles Caggins. In contrast, 45 strikes were conducted in Iraq in October and November. “The Iraqis have not requested assistance with airstrikes in recent weeks, while our operations are paused. All coalition airstrikes have been coordinated with the Iraqi Security Forces for years,” he said. Iraqi military personnel who have benefited from coalition training are making appeals in private, knowing firsthand Iraq's reliance on U.S. military technologies and aircraft. “We have no alternative now,” said the senior CTS official. “The battle against IS is technological, and we don't own any of these technologies, only the Americans do."" U.S. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top American commander for the Middle East, met Tuesday with Iraqi leaders and acknowledged that joint military operations and training have been scaled back, although he said U.S. special operations forces are doing some missions with Iraqi commandos. ""We're still in a period of turbulence. We've got a ways to go,” he said. ——— Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Multiple rockets hit an Iraqi base hosting American troops near the US embassy early Sunday, the latest in a flurry of attacks against US assets in the country.  ""The Coalition confirms small rockets impacted the Iraqi base hosting (coalition) troops in the International Zone... No casualties"" said coalition spokesman Myles Caggins. That base, known as Union III, is the headquarters for the US-led coalition, deployed in Iraq since 2014 to help local troops fight the Islamic State jihadist group.  Also Read: Protesters attack US embassy in Baghdad, ambassador and staff evacuated Iraq's military said three Katyusha rockets hit inside the Green Zone, the high-security enclave where the US mission and Union III are located, as well as Iraqi government buildings, United Nations offices and other embassies. A fourth rocket hit a logistics base in a different neighbourhood operated by the Hashed al-Shaabi, a military network officially incorporated into the Iraqi state, the Iraqi military said. There was no immediate statement from the Hashed. Strikes on assets of both the US and Hashed at the same time are unusual, as Washington has blamed hardline elements within the military network for repeated rocket attacks on American installations across Iraq. Sunday's was the 19th attack since October to target either the embassy or the roughly 5,200 US troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq. No group has claimed responsibility for any of the incidents. In late December, a rocket attack on the northern Iraqi base of K1 left one US contractor dead and unleashed a dramatic series of events. Watch: US Embassy in Baghdad attacked Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq. Days later, an American drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair's death but said they would prioritise a political objective first: the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. But the network includes a broad range of groups and some have appeared more willing to harass US troops militarily. Sunday's attack came just hours after one of the Hashed's Iran-backed factions, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced a ""countdown"" to ousting American forces from the country. A top leader within Nujaba, Nasr al-Shammary, tweeted a photograph of what he claimed was an American military vehicle, adding: ""We are closer than you think."" Sunday's assault reportedly sent warning sirens blaring across the diplomatic compound. Multiple strong explosions followed by aircraft circling near the Green Zone were reported.

NATO and the coalition have non-combat ""train-and-advise"" missions which aim to develop Iraqi security forces but both are suspended over fears for regional stability after a US drone strike killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3. After the killing, US President Donald Trump called on NATO – founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union – to do more in the Middle East but he has not specified publicly what that might entail. NATO defence ministers including US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will discuss options for non-combat operations in the Middle East at a two-day meeting in Brussels starting on Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""We are discussing what more NATO can do,"" he told reporters, adding that the alliance would first seek to restart the training with the Iraqi government's blessing. READ: Support for NATO plummeting in Europe, lowest in Turkey US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said the alliance was also seeking military advice, both from NATO and Iraq, on how to increase the mission, but gave no details. ""I think it will definitely be the answer to what President Trump has requested,"" she said. Established in Baghdad in October 2018, the NATO training mission in Iraq numbers some 500 personnel. It does not deploy alongside Iraqi forces during their operations. Two allied diplomats told Reuters the number of NATO trainers in Iraq could rise to as much as 2,000, but it would not be a net increase of Western troops in Iraq because the US-led coalition would simply re-assign trainers. While symbolic, the coalition is outside NATO structures. Putting more personnel under a NATO flag would solidify training in Iraq and could make it more long-term, also cementing NATO's presence in the region. When Trump first raised increasing NATO's role in the Middle East in 2017, France and Germany resisted, worried that NATO would be caught up in another costly, Afghan-style deployment, anger Arab countries or risk confrontation with Russia in Syria. But diplomats said Paris and Berlin were now open to an expanded NATO mission in Iraq because it was non-combat, held fewer risks, would not be under a US general's command and would go some way to mollifying Trump, a sharp critic of NATO.

Mr Allawi immediately released a video message on Twitter in which he voiced support for anti-government who forced the resignation of his predecessor and have staged demonstrations since October despite crackdowns that killed hundreds. “Without your courage and sacrifice no change would have happened in the country,"" Mr Allawi said. “I believe in you. Therefore I will be asking you to keep up the demonstrations ... don't go back before you get what you want. Demonstrate, chant, protest. This is your right. This is your country,"" he said. “Our duty is to protect you. The weapons of the state must be employed against those who employ weapons against you.” [ https://players.brightcove.net/5367332862001/6PsTC3MuVq_default/index.html?videoId=6128988863001 ] President Barham Salih's decision to name Mr Allawi as prime minister came as the deadline he set political parties to nominate a candidate was about to expire. Mr Allawi, whose nomination and choice of cabinet must be approved by parliament, said he would resist any attempt by political parties to impose ministerial candidates on him. He said his immediate goals were a new elections law and fresh elections, as well as fixing the economy and restoring the prestige of the state security forces. رسالتي لكم محمد توفيق علاوي pic.twitter.com/WUHxrhSb1g Mr Allawi, a former communications minister, will have one month to form a new government. Former prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned in November amid mass protests in Baghdad and southern Iraq to demand the removal of the country's political elite. Nearly 500 protesters have been killed. However, protesters rejected Mr Allawi as prime minister when his name was floated as a possible candidate after President Salih issued his three-day deadline to political parties on Wednesday. The protesters, who accuse Iraq's current politicians of corruption and failing to meet their basic needs, want a complete change in the country's leadership and political system, starting with a new election system. An architect by training, Mr Allawi, 66, was born in Baghdad and served as communications minister first in 2006 and again between 2010-2012. He resigned from his post after a dispute with former prime minister Nouri Al Maliki, who presided over the fall of large areas of the country to ISIS in 2014 and is accused of pro-Shiite sectarian policies. Despite his stated willingness to stand up to political pressure, Mr Allawi was reportedly a candidate agreeable to populist cleric Moqtada Al Sadr's Sairoon parliamentary bloc – the largest in parliament – and the rival Fatah coalition led by Hadi Al Amiri, leader of Iraq's Iran-backed militias. Reports circulated online as Mr Allawi's nomination was announced suggested that he had agreed to eject US troops from Iraq, a key demand of both blocs. Parliament passed a resolution calling for the removal of all foreign troops days after the US killed top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on January 3. Mr Al Amiri's deputy commander in the Hashed Al Shaabi grouping of largely pro-Iran Iraqi militias, Abdul Mahdi Al Muhandis, was also killed in the strike. Suleimani, who oversaw Iran's armed proxies in the region, was seen as a key tool of Iranian influence in Iraq. His assassination came after months of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran over US sanctions targeting Iran's economy and a series of unclaimed attacks in the region targeting the US and its allies. Iraq is caught between the two rivals, needing US economic and military assistance as it seeks to rebuild after the devastation of the war with ISIS and prevent a resurgence by the extremist militants, while at the same time maintaining economic and security ties with its neighbour, with whom many of its current leaders have close ties.","none","none",1,2,0,0

The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said it had received credible allegations of protesters being targeted with hunting rifles, stones and firebombs on the nights of Feb. 14-16, leading to at least 50 injuries. At least 150 people were injured in the city of Karbala in January alone due to similar tactics, UNAMI said in a statement, according to Reuters. “The continued pattern of the use of excessive force, with ambiguously identified armed groups and unclear loyalties, is a grave security concern that must be tackled urgently and decisively.

There was no immediate comment from Iraqi authorities. Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi said on Saturday a new government would be formed in the coming week.

Member’s Iraq’s security forces walk on Baghdad’s Sinak Bridge, after it was shut down by protesters, Feb. 12, 2020. Photo: Reuters / Thaier al-Sudani. Iraqi authorities on Wednesday reopened one of Baghdad’s major bridges, shut for months by anti-government protesters, in a sign of a lull in unrest that has killed hundreds of people and forced the prime minister to resign last year. The Sinak Bridge, one of the main routes across the Tigris River that bisects the city, leads to a district near the fortified Green Zone of government and diplomatic buildings. It runs parallel to another major bridge, Al Jumhuriya, which connects the Green Zone itself to the main protest camp at Tahrir Square, and which remains shut. “Since early this morning, … with the cooperation of protesters, we were able to re-open the Sinak bridge to let vehicles and residents cross freely,” said Lieutenant General Mohammed al-Bayati, the secretary of the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces.

Security forces could be seen near cranes lifting cement barricades put up to block protesters from crossing the bridge. Some tents belonging to protesters were still in place. Later on Wednesday, security forces clashed with protesters, using tear gas and rubber bullets and attempting to keeping them away from the bridge, police sources said. At least nine protesters were injured. Nearly 500 people have been killed in demonstrations which have raged since October, demanding the removal of what protesters see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference — mainly by Iran and the United States. The Baghdad military operations office called on remaining protesters to stay at their main protest camp in Tahrir square, state TV reported. “The reopening of the bridge makes me happy,” a driver on the newly-reopened bridge told Reuters TV. “The government should work to satisfy citizens. We don’t want anything else. We want life to come back to normal.” In separate violence, at least 12 security personnel and 11 protesters were injured in the southern Iraqi province of Nassiriya, medical and security sources said, after clashes broke out in the afternoon.

Two experts who spoke to Military Times worry the base nestled near a key border crossing area could fall into the hands of the Iran-backed group — cementing what national security experts have warned is Tehran’s goal of a land route to the Mediterranean Sea for the movement of arms, proxies and illicit goods. Officials with Operation Inherent Resolve — the U.S.-led mission to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria — say the al-Qaim base transfer is about consolidating coalition forces following successful operations against ISIS militants. “Today marks a historic moment for the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve and our Iraqi Security Partners,” Brig. Gen. Vincent Barker, OIR director of sustainment, said in a release. “Al Qaim base served as a critical location in the fight against Daesh. First, as the Iraqi Security Forces liberated the Al Qaim region from an evil presence, and later as a valuable base during the Battle for Baghouz, the last physical territory held by ISIS. Today’s transfer is possible thanks to the efforts and successes of our ISF partners,"" Barker said in the release. But the base transfer follows two recent rocket attacks targeting an Iraqi base housing coalition troops known as Camp Taji. A rocket attack on March 11 resulted in two U.S. troops and one U.K. service member dead. On March 14, a barrage of 107 mm rockets wounded several American troops. Rocket attacks since October 2019 have precipitated a deadly tit-for-tat escalation between an Iran-backed group known as Kataib Hezbollah and U.S. forces. A rocket attack that killed an American contractor and wounded several U.S. troops in December 2019 in Kirkuk nearly led to a war with Iran. Charles Lister, a senior research fellow and director of Countering Terrorism and Extremism Program at the Middle East Institute, tweeted Tuesday Kataib Hezbollah may take over the base following the U.S. departure. “Who wants to bet that 6 months from now, #Iran-backed militias will be the “ISF” [Iraq security forces] in command of al-Qaim base?,” Lister tweeted. “#IRGC-linked [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] militias already have a sizable presence around al-Qaim, not to mention controlling the other side of the border, in #Syria’s al-Bukamal/Imam Ali Base etc.,” Lister tweeted. Kataib Hezbollah has an extensive network across the Anbar province in Iraq, according to Phillip Smyth, a research fellow for the Washington Institute and Iran expert. The Shia militant group has been known to operate in al-Qaim, Abu Kamal and along Route 1 that runs through Anbar province, Smyth told Military Times. Smyth told Military Times he was sure the base would fall to the Iran-backed group, warning that the militants already had “defacto” control. “Once we’re out, they’ll be there,” Smyth said. Lister told Military Times that Kataib Hezbollah controls the Syria border crossing near al-Qaim. “They’re the key PMU [popular mobilization unit] player around al-Qaim, arguably out-influencing the Iraqi Army’s 8th Division, which is technically al-Qaim-based,” Lister said. Following the Dec. 27 rocket attack against Kirkuk, American warplanes launched retaliatory strikes hitting a Kataib Hezbollah headquarters located in al-Qaim. The airstrikes sparked an escalation that led to a standoff at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, a decapitation strike against Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, and a ballistic missile strike by Iran targeting coalition troops housed at two Iraqi bases. U.S. Central Command has struggled to protect and respond to the rocket attacks that continue unabated despite numerous threats from U.S. officials towards Tehran and its proxies. The coalition has come under criticism for not fielding counter rocket, artillery, and mortar, or C-RAM systems at Iraqi bases, especially Camp Taji, which has been the target of multiple rocket attacks. C-RAM systems can be used to defend bases from indirect fire and mortars, but Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr., the CENTCOM commander, explained they’re often used to bolster the defense of Patriot systems. Patriot missile batteries are moving into Iraq to help counter a potential Iran ballistic missile strike. Camp Taji, the Iraqi base hit by 18 rockets on March 11, did not have a C-RAM system. McKenzie told reporters that CENTCOM has to “ruthlessly prioritize” where it places defensive equipment because there are more troops than systems and assets available to protect everyone. McKenzie said it was an “unpleasant fact” but the U.S. “can’t have C-RAM everywhere.” The CENTCOM commander also noted that the C-RAM is “not a panacea.” On March 13, McKenzie said the threat from Iran “remains very high” following the latest rocket attack against coalition forces involving an Iran-backed Shia militia. OIR said coalition troops would leave al-Qaim in the coming days following the transfer of equipment to Iraqi forces. OIR detailed in a release it was handing over roughly $900,000 worth of equipment to Iraqi forces that includes container housing units, water tanks, generators, tents and barriers. The coalition said it will continue to consolidate forces from smaller bases across Iraq throughout 2020. Shawn Snow is the senior reporter for Marine Corps Times and a Marine Corps veteran.

Two rockets have struck a training base south of Baghdad where US-led coalition troops and NATO trainers are present, Iraq’s military has said. The attack, the third targeting military bases hosting foreign forces in a week, targeted the Besmaya base south of Baghdad on Monday night, read the statement, making no mention of casualties. Spanish forces linked to the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), as well as NATO training forces, are present in Besmaya. Earlier on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq that the US would retaliate “as necessary” against any new assaults on Americans. Since late October, there have been 24 rocket attacks on the US embassy in Baghdad or bases where foreign troops are deployed, killing three American military personnel, one British soldier and one Iraqi soldier. No attacks have been claimed but Washington has blamed Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline faction in the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces) state-sponsored military network. Iraq has long feared it would get caught in the spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, its two main allies.      Tensions between the two countries dramatically spiked in late 2019 when a US contractor was killed in a rocket attack on a separate base in northern Iraq, leading to retaliatory American strikes on Kataeb Hezbollah. Days later, a US drone strike killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Iran launched ballistic missiles at US troops in Iraq while the Iraqi parliament voted to expel all foreign soldiers from its soil, a decision that has yet to be implemented. Some 5,200 American troops are based in Iraq as part of the US-led coalition. Top US military and civilian officials had long expressed frustration that Iraq‘s government was not doing enough to prevent rocket attacks targeting US troops and diplomats.

Officials told the wire service that more than a dozen rockets landed near the base, Camp Taji, and that two Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the attack. The strike comes days after Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, attacked Camp Taji, killing two American troops as well as a British service member.

Islamic State, Iraqi antiquities and organized crime | Global Initiative","Follow us Email us secretariat@globalinitiative.net Mailing address Avenue de France 23 – Geneva, CH-1202 – Switzerland Islamic State, Iraqi antiquities and organized crime Posted on 30 Mar 2020        Although militants claimed they were destroying non-Islamic heritage, Iraqi archaeology experts say these acts were carried out largely to conceal extensive looting of valuable artefacts to help fund their new ‘state’ and associated terrorist activities.   This report examines evidence of looting by IS in and around northern Iraq’s Nineveh governorate. Considering claims that IS not only stole exhibited Iraqi antiquities, but also carried out illicit excavations to plunder new, undiscovered treasures, the report re-evaluates the organization’s self-proclaimed ideological destruction – in reality, organized looting for profit – as an example of 21st-century organized crime.   The report also considers evidence of the onward flow of stolen Iraqi antiquities, and seeks to establish the most likely routes along which stolen artefacts were moved from a terrorist-occupied swathe of territory into neighbouring countries. It considers how IS terrorists transferred artefacts to other organized criminal networks, en route to long-term storage facilities, collectors and global marketplaces.   The demise of IS as a territorial entity, combined with its well-publicized destruction of heritage, means this topic has, by 2020, largely fallen off the radar. However, with countless artefacts from Nineveh still missing, and Iraqi archaeology experts alleging that IS members excavated important historical sites for their treasures, some of these plundered antiquities are now moving through different rungs of organized transnational criminal networks as they head towards collectors of global antiquities and other marketplaces, rendering this an ongoing organized crime.   This report also highlights the need to raise awareness of such thefts in an effort to ensure that global collectors and auction houses are alert to Iraqi antiquities of potentially suspect provenance and with links to terrorist activities entering the global antiquities marketplace in the forthcoming years and decades.  08 Apr 2019 APA-Obs 17 Nov 2016 Crime & Conflict, Crime Terror Nexus, Protecting Politics 25 Oct 2018 Crime & Conflict, Crime Terror Nexus, Wildlife Watch 02 Sep 2021 Crime & Conflict, Crime Terror Nexus, WEA-Obs Subscribe and stay in the loop with Global Initiative news If you have read and agree to the Privacy policy, please confirm our authorization to store your e-mail to send our newsletter.

Zurfi now has 30 days to form a government that must then survive a vote of confidence in Iraq’s deeply divided parliament. He is the second man chosen to succeed Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November amid mass anti-government protests. The next candidate, Mohammed Allawi, quit on March 1, accusing parties of obstructing him. President Barham Salih named Zurfi only after larger rival Shiite political parties failed to agree on a candidate. Those same groups rounded on the new candidate, who is head of the small Nasr parliamentary group of former Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. “We hold the president fully responsible for the repercussions of these provocative steps,” said the Fatih alliance, which represents mostly Iran-backed Shiite militia leaders in parliament. “He’s an American joker and we reject him,” said Hassan Salim, a member of parliament from Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, an Iranian-backed group that is designated as a terrorist organization. Zurfi lived in the US as a refugee in the 1990s after fleeing the Saddam Hussein regime, and is seen as a comparatively secular figure. After Saddam’s overthrow, he was governor of Najaf. Hours before his nomination, two rockets fell inside Basmaya military camp to the south of Baghdad, which houses US-led coalition troops, without causing any damage.","none","none",0,0,0,0

"109",2103,"https://news.yahoo.com/iraqi-military-2-rockets-hit-084922422.html","Iraqi officials say rockets strike Baghdad's Green Zone","BAGHDAD (AP) — At least three rockets struck Baghdad's fortified Green Zone near the American Embassy late Tuesday, a day after an attack on a training base south of Baghdad where U.S.-led coalition troops and NATO trainers were present, Iraqi security officials said. It was the fourth such attack in the span of a week. At least three rockets struck the Green Zone, the seat of Iraq's government and home to several foreign embassies, two Iraqi security officials said. Myles Caggins, spokesman for the coalition, said the rockets fell at least 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the embassy. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The previous evening, rockets hit the Basmaya base near the Iraqi capital, an Iraqi army statement said. The projectiles landed in an area that includes agricultural land and a factory, according to the statement. No more details were provided. A Spanish contingent of the coalition and NATO trainers are present at the Basmaya site. There was no immediate confirmation of the attack from the coalition and no militant group claimed responsibility for the assault. Last Wednesday, a barrage of over two dozen rockets struck Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, killing three coalition servicemen, including two Americans. A British serviceman was also killed. It was the deadliest to target U.S. troops in Iraq since a late December rocket attack on an Iraqi base, which killed a U.S. contractor and set in motion a series of attacks that brought Iraq to the brink of war. Wednesday's barrage was followed by another attack, on Saturday at the same site, which wounded five soldiers — three coalition members and two Iraqi soldiers. The first attack prompted American airstrikes Friday against what U.S. officials said were mainly weapons facilities belonging to Kataib Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia group believed to be responsible for the attack. However, Iraq's military said those airstrikes killed five security force members and a civilian, while wounding five fighters from the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella organization including an array of militias, including some Iran-backed groups. Iran-backed Shiite militia groups vowed to exact revenge, signalling another cycle of tit-for-tat violence between Washington and Tehran that could play out in Iraq.

Posted: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT Updated: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT Posted: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT Updated: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT BAGHDAD (AP) — The U.S.-led coalition withdrew on Sunday from a military base in northern Iraq that nearly launched Washington into an open war with neighboring Iran. The K1 Air Base is the third site coalition forces have left this month in line with U.S. plans to consolidate its troops in two locations in Iraq. A rocket attack on the base in late December killed one American contractor and lead to a series of tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. and Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups. The attacks culminated in the U.S.-directed killing of top Iranian general Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Coalition forces handed over the K1 air base in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk to Iraq’s military, according to a coalition statement. At least $1.1 million of equipment was transferred to the Iraqis as 300 coalition personnel departed. K1 has hosted coalition forces since 2017 to launch operations against the Islamic State group in the nearby mountainous areas. Areas south of Kirkuk, and north of neighboring provinces of Diyala, Salahaddin and Nineveh remain hot beds of IS activity. The stretch of territory is also disputed between the federal Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish region, which has created security gaps benefiting IS militants. The coalition’s presence had at times been a mediating presence between the two competing authorities. A senior coalition official earlier this month claimed IS forces weren’t as able to exploit the “security gap” between Iraqi and Kurdish forces as the militants did in the past. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that Daesh is free to operate in the way that they wish,” said the official, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group. “They’re still pretty constrained.” The coalition official was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. U.S.-led forces have already withdrawn this month from Qaim, near the border with Syria and Qayara base, in Nineveh earlier. All were in line with plans to pullout from bases across Iraq and consolidate coalition forces in Baghdad and at Ain al-Asad Air Base in the country’s western desert. The plan has been in the works since late last year, the senior coalition military official said, and accelerated when Iraqi forces proved they were capable of facing the threat from the IS with limited coalition assistance. Coalition officials said they would still assist Iraqi forces with air support and surveillance, but significantly cut back on training and ground operations, as the limited withdrawal continues. Until last month, there were some 7,500 coalition troops based in Iraq, including 5,000 U.S. forces. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to the leadership vacuum it has been plagued with since Adil Abd Al-Mahdi assumed office in October 2018, this is likely to worsen on several scales and culminate into a perfect storm that will drive the country to the brink. Social Crisis The youth protests that started on 1 October 2019 and engulfed Baghdad and Iraq’s nine southern provinces started for several reasons. They boil down to a clash between the “haves” and the “have-nots”. Picture the convoys of armoured SUVs ferrying politicians and officials versus the now infamous tuk-tuks, the method of transportation for those who cannot afford a taxi, let alone their own vehicle. The social upheaval has paralysed several cities, prevented tens of thousands of Iraqi children from attending school and led to the resignation of the government. Despite the promises of reform, the draft pieces of legislation sitting on the desks of parliamentarians and the continuous hiring of Iraqi public sector employees, the protests have not declined. The youth are crying out that they “want a homeland” which seems odd unless you interpret it to mean “hope”. This is sorely missing from average Iraqis, whether young or old due to the lack of vision provided by Abd Al-Mahdi and his lacklustre cabinet. Political Crisis The social upheaval led Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani to give a sermon (through a representative) on 29 November 2019 calling on the Government of Iraq to resign. The same day, Abd Al-Mahdi wrote to the Iraqi Council of Representatives informing them that he is resigning. Abd Al-Mahdi also asked his cabinet to discharge their duties until replacement ministers take over their portfolios. Due to political wrangling and then the killing of Qods Force Commander Major General Qassim Soleimani and Public Mobilization Forces (PMF) Deputy Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, in an American airstrike just outside Baghdad International Airport, the process to replace Abd Al-Mahdi was severely delayed. An agreement was made between the leaders of the Fateh and Sairoon Alliances. Hadi Al-Ameri and Muqtada Al-Sadr would push the candidacy of Mohammed Tawfik Allawi as a new face to the existing political equation which emerged as a result of the 2018 election which made the two men kingmakers. On 1 February 2020 President Barham Salih nominated Allawi to form a new government within thirty days. Allawi was given mission impossible: appease the protestors trying to bring the political system down and also woo the parliamentarians that make up the system so they vote for him, his government programme and his cabinet. After a month of preparation and horse-trading, Allawi went to parliament on 27 February only to be shunned by a majority of parliamentarians who boycotted the parliamentary session in order to avoid a vote on his candidacy. On 1 March Allawi went to parliament again and once again the majority of MPs boycotted the session. Later that night, Allawi withdrew his nomination. While Iraq’s politicians are back to square one, resigned Prime Minister Abd Al-Mahdi confirmed his stance that it is wrong that he remains as acting prime minister after resigning in November. With the acting prime minister shirking responsibility and no replacement in sight, Iraq could be a ship without a captain in the coming days. While Iraq has a president, his ceremonial position is not to head the executive branch of government. Also, Salih will now be preoccupied with replacing Allawi as the constitution provides him the ability to choose a candidate without reverting back to the largest bloc in parliament. All eyes will be on Salih as the success or failure of the new candidate will be on his shoulders in the same way that Allawi’s failure is on the shoulders of Sadr and Ameri. Economic Crisis As we enter the third month of 2020, Iraq has yet to pass the federal budget law for this financial year. This means that the Government of Iraq can only cover operational expenses such as salaries as it does not have the legal basis to spend on investment projects. With the government being the biggest player in Iraq’s economy, rather than the private sector, we could see an economic slowdown in the coming months, if not weeks. With oil revenues making up nearly ninety percent of Iraq’s budget, the recent decline in oil prices are concerning, to say the least. This last week Brent Crude traded below $50. Iraq’s oil revenues are based on the cost of Brent Crude minus the cost of extraction, which varies from oilfield to oilfield and also the quality of the oil. Thus Iraq makes $3-7 below Brent Crude. This means that Iraq is making $42-46 per barrel of oil. At production rates of 4.16 million barrels per day, Iraq will earn $5.2 billion to $5.7 billion per month which is barely enough to cover the costs of the salaries of the public sector employees. If the price of oil continues to fall, as is expected due to the coronavirus epidemic, then the government will only be able to meet its commitment to public sector employees but not finance its debts or meet other financial obligations. The Perfect Storm The continued protests, coupled with the lack of leadership and the looming economic crisis make for a perfect storm in Iraq as it approaches the searing heat of its summers. The political elite need to think about the next four to six months and work towards solutions to the above-mentioned problems. Otherwise they could see themselves as the former political elite of the country as Iraq descends into further instability and greater chaos.

Frantzman Who is Adnan al-Zarfi (Zurufi عدنان الزرفي), the man tasked with forming yet another Iraqi government on March 17 by President Barham Salih. after almost six months of uncertainty, protests and increasing US-Iran tensions in Iraq, he has a major job ahead of himself. He will have a huge task ahead of him to try to build a coalition, deal with the rising anti-US rocket attacks by Iranian-backed groups, rebuild Sunni areas, fight an ISIS insurgency, come to a budget agreement with the autonomous Kurdish region and manage parliamentary demands for US withdrawal. Recent events He has been active in Najaf for many years. Accused of ""irresponsible statements"" in a legal dispute last year as a member of parliament. In the fall of 2019 his name was already put forward as a possible replacement for Adel Abdul Mahdi. An MP said that there was a ""meeting where it was discussed the challenges of getting out of the [protest] crisis, pointing to the existence of alternative names put forward in the meeting, in the event of Abdul Mahdi’s resignation, as the governor of Basra, Asaad al-Aydani, MP Adnan al-Zarfi, and former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani."" During the protests he was outspoken several times. In December when parliament failed to convene on Sunday for the fourth consecutive day after Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi failed to attend. One reports notes ""Nasr Coalition deputy Adnan Zarfi warned political leaders against losing their “last chance” and said authorities must not commit their previous mistakes, rather they must listen to the demands of the youth."" In February 2019 Muqtada al-Sadr and Hadi al-Amiri were campaigning in favor of a vote to end American military presence in the country. Kurdistan 24 noted ""However, Zarfi, pointing to the 'worrying' security situation in Iraq, warned the legislature against “rushing” to pass such a law, but reassured that it would be 'difficult' to do so."" In the spring of 2018, as Najaf governor, Zarfi sought to reconcile Haider Abadi and Ali Sistani. He was pushed out as Najaf governor in 2015. He was an active parliamentarian from Najaf since then. His appointment is argued by some to be supported by Muqtada al-Sadr, factions within the Fatah Alliance, Haider al-Abadi and even Hikma. He may have faced opposition from Nouri al-Maliki, some elements of Badr and Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Others say that the opposite is true, that he faces opposition from Hikma's Ashura militia. They note ""those reject to the commission of Adnan Al-Zorfi [sic]: The Sadr movement is the owner of the Saraya Salam Brigades militia, the Al-Fatih block [Fatah Alliance], the Badr militia. Hikmat Bloc and its Ashura militia. Sadikon bloc with the Asaib Ahl Al-Haq militia."" It is thought he will have the same hurdles as Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi. Active in reconstruction after 2003 He was outspoken after the US-led invasion in 2003. A Wall Street Journal piece mentioned him:""The governor of this holy city wanted a 51-year-old Texan named Brent Blaschke to improve the deteriorating security on the main road. 'People believe you can do a lot more,' said the governor, Adnan al-Zarfi."" He was seen as independent in reports. He was also involved in mediating the 2004 clashes with Muqtada al-Sadr. At the time The Guardian noted ""The attack on the vast cemetery near the Imam Ali mosque, Najaf's holiest site, followed a night of intermittent gunfire. Adnan al-Zarfi, the governor of Najaf, yesterday gave US forces approval to enter the mosque complex, which the US claims is being used by Mr Sadr's loyalists as a launchpad for attacks."" Zarfi (often known as Zurufi in some documents in English) is mentioned in US diplomatic cables. In one cable in 2004 the US met with him and other members of Najaf's political establishment, including ""Talal Bilal, the Governor's aide and close friend"" and Dawa party member Provincial Council Chair Shayk Fa'ad. At this time Muqtada al Sadr had signed an agreement after the intervention of Ali Sistani into Najaf's crises. ""They further feel that the agreement al-Sadr signed has strengthened the Iraqi Government's ability to move against al-Sadr if the Mahdi Militia takes up arms once again."" Assessments at the time in Najaf indicated to theUS that Jaysh al Mahdi would ""splinter"" between ""extremists"" such as Qais Khazali (eventually founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq) and others who might join the Dawa party. ""Fa'ad speculated that some elements of the Jaysh al-Mahdi might be absorbed into the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI)."" The cable notes there ""was a schism in the party [SCIRI], and within its Badr Corps, over how closely the party should remain aligned to Iran....Other members, including Badr Corps commanders such as Mahdi Muhandis, wanted to have closer ties with Iran. Fa'ad alleged that individuals like Muhandis had made early overtures to the Jaysh al-Mahdi movement and may now look to absorb these erstwhile allies, and by extension the resources of their Iranian backers, into SCIRI."" The US killed Muhandis andIRGC commander Qasem Soleimani on January 3, 2020. ""All three men [including Zarfi] agree that al-Sadr is finished politically. ""Governor Zurufi shares Talal's assessment that al-Sadr is finished politically. The Governor also agrees that if al-Sadr violates the points of the proposal that the government will be on much firmer ground to move against him."" Zarfi sought funds for Najaf. He pushed for an oil investment project in 2010. ""Najaf Governor Adnan al-Zarfi told Aswat al-Iraq news agency. The project is expected to produce 400,000 barrels of oil per day and will provide the province with $400 million a year, he added."" He wanted more investment in agriculture in 2011. ""Najaf governor announced the availability of great water storage in Najaf desert enough for 25 years, stressing granting licenses to cultivate 70.000 dunams in the desert area that will depend on underground waters. Governor Adnan al-Zarfi told Aswat al-Iraq that the province made an agricultural plan to depend on underground waters, instead of the Euphrates River."" He pushed for more school the same year. ""Najaf Governor Adnan al-Zarfi as criticizing the Education Ministry for the delay in constructing new schools in the governorate,"" In 2013 he pushed for a new airport ""Najaf Governor Adnal Al-Zarfi disclosed that there are plans to increase the space of Najaf city by new housing complexes as well as industrial and agricultural projects."" When the US left Iraq in 2011 he made comments to The New York Times. The article is quoted in part below: ""'Before 2003, 90 percent of Najaf people liked Iranians,' said the governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, who has lived in Chicago and Michigan and holds American citizenship. 'Now, 90 percent hate them. Iran likes to take, not give.' Near midnight, Mr. Zurufi held court at a cafe, his team of bodyguards standing sentry at the door, frisking patrons. Outside, a convoy of white sport utility vehicles waited, and nearby, down a crooked alleyway, thousands of visitors took in the nighttime serenity of the Imam Ali Shrine, one of the holiest sites for the Shiite diaspora, where millions of Iranians flock every year. Mr. Zurufi's comments cut against the grain of what is commonly understood about the influence of Iran in southern Iraq, where the two countries have a common religious bond - both are majority Shiite - but where nationality competes with sect."" - October 8, 2011 The article noted that he was appointed in 2004 by L.Paul Bremer III, then the top American administrator in Iraq, elected to the same job in 2009 and that he was pro-American. ""Not only did the Americans refuse a request by Mr. Zarfi and other officials to open a consulate in Najaf, the State Department's Provincial Reconstruction Team in Najaf actually shut down earlier than scheduled this summer after local clerical pressure, particularly from officials loyal to Mr. Sadr, who spends most of his time in Iran."" Social media We analyzed Arabic tweets about him, including here and here and there is video of him meeting Iraq's President. A photo of an alleged US passport he has was also put up. Protesters have said he will fail. He has been accused of being close to the US, Qatar and having mismanaged Najaf. ""He failed to manage a province, how can he manage the country,"" one twitter user asks. These critics also see him as linked to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and close to the US. Photos allegedly show him with US soldiers. Other critics accused him of corruption in schemes at Najaf airport and of harming protesters in the city. A note by protesters was also posted saying they vow to topple him. A decree appointing him was put online and video shows him with the press. Reports online about his appointment can be found at Rudaw and Al-Mayadeen. According to these reports Monday, Sadr's Sairoon called on Iraqi President Barham Salih (برهم صالح) to name the new prime minister after the major blocs failed to reach a compromise candidate. There had been rumors that Naim Al-Suhail would be tapped. Pressure was rising also from Khazali and others US Department of Defense assessment A lengthy report about his appointment from 2004. We have added it in full: A former prisoner of the Saddam Hussein regime who returned to Iraq from exile last year has been appointed as the new governor of Najaf province, coalition administrator Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III announced today in Baghdad. Emphasizing that Iraqi authorities and the coalition are cooperating to reaffirm the rule of law and to restore order to the middle Euphrates area, Bremer said Adnan al- Zurufi's appointment will enhance that cooperation. Bremer said he appointed Zurufi as Najaf's governor now because the difficulties and sufferings of the people of the middle Euphrates region can't wait for the turnover of sovereignty on June 30 and national elections in January. ""He is the right man for the job at this time,"" Bremer said. ""A sports hero as a youth, Governor Zurufi showed his love of justice as the head of an anti-Saddam student organization. This led to his imprisonment and escape from Saddam's jails. He participated in the 1991 Iraq intifada, and was eventually forced into exile. He returned to Najaf in April last year."" Zurufi, a member of the Bani Hassan tribe, earned a degree in Islamic law at Alfik College, the Islamic jurisprudence college, in Najaf. ""Governor Zurufi's attachment to Najaf and his proven willingness to fight for justice will serve the people well as he administers the government,"" Bremer pointed out. Radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr is believed to be in the city of Najaf, and has continued to incite his followers to violence. Iraqi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Sadr in connection with the murder of a prominent Shiia cleric. ""The contrast between Governor Zurufi's love of justice and the behavior of another individual in the middle Euphrates could not be more stark,"" Bremer said. ""Over the past few months, one man and armed elements under his control have spread lawlessness, fear and economic paralysis, especially in Najaf and Karbala."" - By Rudi Williams, American Forces Press Service, WASHINGTON, May 6, 2004. Other sources He is remembered as a former team member of the Iraq Reconstruction and Development Council (IRDC), a US Department of Defense supported group. This led to his appointment in 2004 and later his work with the government during the Sadr crises in 2004. He was a target of some IED and other attacks between 2004 and 2006.

The CVs are taken from the official page of Al Wafa Movement. Opposition to his appointment A report posted online notes why he should be opposed: ""The nomination of any person accused of corruption for any important position as a betrayal of the size of the position to which he is nominated, and whoever nominates corrupt or endorses a corrupt nomination, or is silent about the nomination of a corrupt is a partner in corruption, and encourages him knowingly and previously insistently, as he is responsible for the results. 1 - Mr. Adnan Al-Zarfi had previously held the position of Governor of Najaf for several years, ending in his conviction for corruption, and dismissing him from his position fundamentally and a decision to dismiss him from the Presidency of the Republic was issued by Republic Decree No. 64 of September 17, 2015, signed by former President Fouad Masum. And who is dismissed because he is not fit for a conservative position, how can he be assigned to the highest position in the state? 2 - Iraq is going through a critical stage represented in the struggle to preserve its independence and sovereignty in front of foreign forces that violate its sovereignty over its airspace and exercise combat operations without the permission of its government and bomb Iraqi government forces without the approval of the executive authority, and kill Iraqi citizens, thereby attacking the powers of the judicial authority The exclusive right to investigation, conviction, punishment, and execution for any violation committed by an Iraqi citizen. There is no doubt that the prime minister’s first mission in these circumstances is to preserve Iraqi sovereignty from any force that violates it, hold it accountable and take the necessary measures to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq, and this does not come with the nomination of a person closely related to the entity that violates the sovereignty of the Iraqi state and kills its citizens in cold blood. 3 - While the Iraqi people take pride in the heroic fighters of the popular crowd [PMU] who liberated Iraq from ISIS and made in this way the most precious sacrifices, nominating those who sympathize with the forces attacking the popular crowd means confronting the outrage of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis who are jealous of the popular crowd and who appreciate their sacrifices, Which shocks the hopes of the majority of honest Iraqis ... and makes the new prime minister in front of two ways that have no third: satisfying the loyal masses of those who liberated the homeland from ISIS, or satisfying the foreigner who declares his war against those who liberated the homeland from ISIS. 4 - The name of Adnan Al-Zarfi was mentioned among those involved in the recent events of Najaf, including the burning of public and private property, attacks and armed violence that led to the loss of life, making his commission before the results of the investigation of these events appear an irresponsible act that denotes the disregard for the civil rights of the people of Najaf and disregards the blood of its citizens. 5 - In all cases, Adnan Al-Zarfi is a figure that is not suitable for this sensitive position in this sensitive circumstance. Whoever is not fit for a conservative administration is not suitable for state administration, and whoever is not entrusted with a conservative treasury does not trust a state treasury, and it is sufficient for the President of the Republic to review a chapter file Al-Zarfi is from the position of the governor of Najaf to brief himself on the reasons for his dismissal, and the reasons for it, which clearly indicate his non-suitability for any public office or serious responsibility."" © 2023 by MECRA Proudly created with Wix.com © 2018 All rights reserved.","none","none",1,0,0,0

In an extraordinary cabinet meeting attended by KRG Prime Minister Masrour Barzani, KRG Deputy Prime Minister Qubad Talabani, and other senior officials, the government reviewed the measures being taken at all hospitals, border crossings, and medical centers in Kurdistan Region and discussed ways to balance the urgent need to protect the public and ensure that trade and commerce with neighboring countries continued to flow. To reduce the damage that the virus and the government’s preparations will do to the businesses, shops, and restaurants, it was decided that each ministry shall independently take measures to reduce the fees and taxes on the places that the governorates closed to prevent damages done to the places. The KRG also said it will to provide all necessary aid and medical assistance to displaced people living in the Region’s camps in coordination with UN agencies and NGOs. The KRG’s decisions came after the Kurdistan Region on Wednesday recorded its first coronavirus death, although the cause of death was disputed by the federal ministry of health. Iraq’s Health Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it was not clear whether a death reported as Iraq’s first coronavirus death had in fact been from the new virus. A local health department said earlier on Wednesday that an elderly man in the Kurdish province of Sulaimani had succumbed to the disease. Iraq has so far has recorded 31 cases of the new coronavirus, one Iranian student who has since been sent home and 30 Iraqis who had all visited Iran recently.

Any opinions expressed are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of Iraq Business News. Since October 2019, Iraq is experiencing a turning point in its history with popular mobilizations demanding radical change. The Iraqi revolution is a societal uprising involving a wide spectrum of society including the dispossessed, the marginalized, the ones deprived of resources and power. Women's massive participation from young female students to older women has turned this uprising to a people's revolution. While remarkable, this participation is not surprising, it only makes visible deep societal realities and transformations that have found their space of expression in the Iraqi streets and squares of protest.

"118",2298,"https://www.dawn.com/news/1544882","US-led forces pull out of third Iraqi base in a month","BAGHDAD: The US-led coalition in Iraq withdrew on Sunday from a military base in the country’s north that nearly launched Washington into an open war with neighbouring Iran. The K1 Air Base is the third site coalition forces have left this month, in line with US plans to consolidate its troops in two locations in Iraq. A rocket attack on the base in late December killed one American contractor and lead to a series of tit-for-tat attacks between the US and Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups. The attacks culminated in the US-directed killing of top Iranian Gen Qassem Soleimani and a senior Iraqi militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Coalition forces handed over the K1 base in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk to Iraq’s military, according to a coalition statement. At least $1.1 million of equipment was transferred to the Iraqis as 300 coalition personnel departed. Until last month, there were some 7,500 coalition troops based in Iraq, including 5,000 US forces. Withdrawals are planned in the coming days from two bases in western Iraq, said Col. Myles Caggins, a coalition spokesman. He said troops have so far been relocated to other bases in the country and some will head home in the coming weeks, but did not specify how many. He said the two bases are the Nineveh Operations Command in Mosul Iraq’s second-largest city and which was under the militant Islamic State group’s control from 2014 until 2017 and the Taqaddum military airport outside the city of Habbaniya, on the Euphrates River. K1 has hosted coalition forces since 2017 to launch operations against IS in nearby mountainous areas. Areas south of Kirkuk, and north of neighbouring provinces of Diyala, Salahuddin and Nineveh remain hotbeds of IS activity. The stretch of territory is also disputed between the federal Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish region, which has created security gaps benefiting IS militants. The coalition’s presence had at times been a mediating force between the two competing authorities. A senior coalition official earlier this month claimed IS forces weren’t as able to exploit the security gap between Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as the militants did in the past. That (gap) doesn’t necessarily mean that Daesh is free to operate in the way that they wish,” said the official, using the Arabic acronym for IS. They’re still pretty constrained. US-led forces have already withdrawn this month from the Qayara base in Nineveh province followed by the Qaim base near the border with Syria. All the withdrawals were in line with plans to pull out from bases across Iraq and consolidate coalition forces in Baghdad and at the Ain al-Asad Air Base in the country’s western desert. The plan has been in the works since late last year, the senior coalition military official has said, and accelerated when Iraqi forces proved they were capable of facing the IS threat with limited coalition assistance. Coalition officials said they would still assist Iraqi forces with air support and surveillance, but significantly cut back on training and ground operations, as the limited withdrawal continues.

Furious that their disorganized and thoroughly looted government lacks the money and human resources to mount an effective defense, the protesters are setting up their own screening and treatment facilities, distributing information on how to prevent the spread of the disease, and giving out medical masks. “The real virus is Iraqi politicians. We are immune to almost everything else,” grumbled a protester named Fatima to the AFP news service on Tuesday. “Political parties and corruption are an epidemic that is much more dangerous than the coronavirus. This is the outbreak we want to get rid of because it has destroyed Iraq,” agreed another protester named Mohammad. “Even in normal times our health care system is totally run down. Now, on top of everything, we have a coronavirus outbreak, and we are supposed to rely on these facilities?” said Fatima, an 18-year-old medical student who was doing volunteer work at one of the protesters’ clinics in Tahrir Square, the heart of the protest movement in Baghdad. AFP grimly noted that the improvised clinics were originally put together to treat gunshot wounds and tear gas exposure. A group of protesters made that history explicit by chanting at security troopers, “Your snipers didn’t deter us, what can the coronavirus do?” Iraq reported five new suspected coronavirus cases on Tuesday, which would bring the total to 32 if they are confirmed. The country’s first case was diagnosed only last week. Most of Iraq’s cases to date can be traced to Iran, where Iraqi Shiites frequently travel to visit holy shrines that have become major sources of concern to epidemiologists (and the scenes of some very ill-considered acts of defiance against the virus). The Iraqi protest movement was already critical of Iran’s influence over politics in Iraq. According to AFP, “anti-Iranian sentiment” is on the rise due to the coronavirus. Iranian officials have been notoriously secretive about the spread of the virus in their country, and the protesters think Iraqi officials have been no more honest. Iraq’s containment procedures proved a mixed blessing for the protesters, since school closings freed up more students to take to the streets, while some influential Iraqis have instructed their followers to stay home to keep the coronavirus from spreading. The resignation of Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi on Monday infused the demonstrations with renewed energy. Kurdish news service Rudaw was not favorably impressed by how the government of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq is handling the epidemic: Rumors and mixed messages about the coronavirus spread on social media and by word of mouth have left Erbil residents frightened and confused, undermining measures to prevent an outbreak in the Kurdistan Region. Even though coronavirus is spread through person to person contact and can be transmitted rapidly in crowded urban spaces, Erbil’s downtown bazaar was packed with shoppers and traders on Saturday evening. […] It seems a lot of the misinformation spreading in Erbil is coming from social media – often an unreliable source. Dilshad Kochar, 29, who sells mobile phone cases in the Erbil bazaar, said the public has been left “ignorant”. “Now it turns out that social media is full of lies,” he said. “Look, in the last few days, every pharmacy was packed with people buying masks. Now you show me how many people use masks. You will barely find anyone.” “I read on social media a list of nutritional items needed to strengthen the immune system such as apples, lemons, and oranges,” Kochar said. “But then yesterday, I came across a friend who had seen a doctor. The doctor had advised him not to eat anything that contains sugar, even fruits and vegetables including apples and lemons and other stuff. You tell me, what should I do?” he added with exasperation. Kochar told Rudaw he was particularly happy to learn from the social media rumor mill that “smoking is good,” which would come as surprising news to the coronavirus victims of China, a land of heavy smokers. Other odd beliefs floating around Kurdistan include women having exceptional resistance to infection, children under 12 being completely immune, and the virus being a microscopic soldier of Allah sent to punish the Chinese for bullying Muslims. The Kurdistan Regional Government reported its fifth case of the coronavirus on Monday in the province of Sulaimani. The head of the Sulaimani Health Directorate denied rumors that one of the patients was killed by the coronavirus.

Seeking to stem an outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of Iraq’s 18 provinces have declared curfews of several days. Baghdad, the Arab world’s second most populous capital with 10 million inhabitants, imposed a curfew from Tuesday evening for six days. But the government’s social distancing efforts are facing a hurdle, as pilgrims defy restrictions to commemorate the anniversary of the death of revered Shiite Imam Musa al-Kadhim. The anniversary, which will be marked on Saturday, typically draws millions of pilgrims from around the world each year to Baghdad, to visit and kiss the gold-domed shrine housing the imam’s resting place on the banks of the Tigris River. Traditionally, pilgrims converge on foot on the imposing complex to pray and take part in mourning ceremonies that lasts several days. Top cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani has urged Iraqis not to gather in large numbers for prayers, where risk of contamination could be high, and declared the fight against the novel coronavirus a “sacred duty”. Iraq has imposed travel restrictions and shuttered shrines across the country, including that of Imam Kadhim. On Wednesday, Iraqi troops stationed around the site tried to persuade fervent pilgrims to return home. “It’s for your own health that we’re doing this,” one soldier told an elderly woman in the street. “No one can prevent us from visiting our imams! Not terrorism, not war, not a virus!” she shot back. Musa al-Kadhim, the seventh of 12 imams venerated by Shiite Muslims, died in 799 while in detention by Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid. At another checkpoint, a group of around 20 men waved flags bearing yellow and green religious emblems as they tried to make their way past soldiers blocking the street. In contrast, the holy Shiite shrine city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, was markedly quiet. The mausoleum of the Prophet Mohammad’s son-in-law Ali was shut and its usually busy esplanade empty, an AFP photographer said. Health authorities have reported 13 deaths and 164 infections in Iraq from the novel coronavirus. However, many suspect the number of cases could be higher, as fewer than 2,000 people have been tested in a country of 40 million. Iraqis have expressed fear over the impact of a large outbreak in the country, as years of conflict and poor investment have ravaged the country’s health system.

Global News Pakistan - Pakistan's Premier News Translation Agency BAGHDAD, 19 March 2020 (GNP) : Iraq’s president named little-known former regional governor Adnan al-Zurfi as prime minister-designate on Tuesday in another bid to overcome months of unrest and deadlock, but powerful Shi’ite blocs quickly lined up to reject his nomination. Zurfi now has 30 days to try and form a government which must then survive a vote of confidence in Iraq’s deeply divided parliament. He is the second man chosen to succeed Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned as prime minister in November amid mass anti-government protests. The next candidate, Mohammed Allawi, quit on March 1, accusing parties of obstructing him. Lawmakers told Reuters that President Barham Salih had named Zurfi only after larger rival Shi’ite political parties failed to agree on one candidate. Some of those same groups rounded on the new candidate, who is head of the small Nasr parliamentary group of former prime minister Haider al-Abadi, a U.S. ally. “We hold the president fully responsible for the repercussions of these provocative steps,” read a statement from the Fatih alliance, which represents mostly Iran-backed Shi’ite militia leaders in parliament. “He’s an American joker and we reject him”, said Hassan Salim, a lawmaker from Asaib Ahl al-Haq Iranian-backed group which the United States designated as a terrorist organization in January. Zurfi lived in the United States as a refugee in the 1990s after fleeing the regime of Saddam Hussein and is seen as a comparatively secular figure in a country long dominated by sectarian parties. After Saddam’s overthrow, he served as governor of the predominantly Shi’ite Najaf province during the U.S. occupation. Zurfi will have to deal with both the powerful Iran-backed groups and with protesters who have been camping out for months, demanding an overhaul of the whole political elite. President Salih called on Zurfi to work on holding “early fair elections” and to meet protests’ demands. Hours before the nomination, two rockets fell inside Basmaya military camp to the south of Baghdad, which houses U.S.-led coalition troops, without causing any damage on injuries.

This is the third attack on installations hosting foreign forces within a week. The rockets slammed into the Besmaya base south of Baghdad late Monday night, a statement by the military said, making no mention of casualties. Spanish forces linked to the US-led coalition fighting ISIS, as well as NATO training forces, are present in Besmaya. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq Monday that the US would retaliate ""as necessary"" against any new assaults on Americans after a slew of rocket attacks. The US last week launched airstrikes against an Iranian-allied militia following a deadly attack on an Iraqi base housing US troops, but rocket fire has continued unabated. A fresh spate of rockets, brazenly fired in the daytime, targeted the crowded Taji air base north of Baghdad last Saturday, wounding three members of the US-led coalition.

"134",2649,"https://www.albawaba.com/news/what-are-iraqi-refugees-doing-syrian-camp-1346089","What Are Iraqi Refugees Doing in Syrian Camp? | Al Bawaba","The al-Hol camp in northeastern-most point in Syria is home to thousands of refugees, the majority of whom are Iraqi women and children. Some came there willingly, while a few sought refuge after fleeing their homeland when the ISIS extremist group swept through the region. Others were forced to flee to the camp when the pro-Iran Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq fought back against the terror group. Al-Hol also houses the families of ISIS members. These families make up the majority of the residents, who came to the camp after the group lost its territories in Iraq and Syria in spring 2019. Iraqis make up some 40,000 of al-Hol’s 68,000 residents. The camp is home to women and children who have been abandoned by ISIS fathers, who headed to the battlefronts where they were either killed or captured. Little is known of the ISIS prisoners after the Baghdad government abandoned them. They are currently held in jails run by the US-backed Kurdish Democratic Forces (SDF). Iraqi family Shayma hails from the Iraqi city of Mosul. Now in her 50s, she fled the city with her family in summer 2015. Her husband and son, both members of ISIS, were killed. She escaped with what remained of her family to the Syrian border city of al-Qaim. After heavy fighting broke out there, she entered Syria and sought refuge in the village of Abou Hamam in the northern Deir Ezzor countryside. She moved from town to town until she and her family of five reached al-Hol. She now lives in a tent that does little to keep out the bitter winter cold and scorching summer heat. She lives there with her three daughters and two sons, aged 10 and 5. Asharq Al-Awsat toured the sparsely furnished tent. In one corner, Shayma set up a makeshift kitchen, in another, she set up a bathroom, which is separated from the rest of the tent with a dark grey curtain. The rest of the tent is styled in traditional Arab furnishings. Her oldest daughter, Haifa, 30 told Asharq Al-Awsat that she is married to an ISIS member who is still in the field. “I don’t know anything about him. He may have been killed,” she said, adding that she has a child with him. She was born in Syria’s Baghouz, where ISIS made its last stand in the war-torn country. She is now a year and two months old. Another sister, Wadad, married a Moroccan ISIS fighter when she was only 14 years old. He was killed in the battle of Hajin two years ago. Now 17, she gave birth to a child from him a year ago. With tears in her eyes, she expressed her conflicting feelings: “I don’t know what to tell my child when she grows up. Who was her father? How was he killed? Will I list the areas we sought refuge in to flee the fighting?” Al-Hol was set up in the late 1990s to house 20,000 people. The number of its residents ballooned after the battle for Baghouz and now it holds 70,000 people in the arid Syrian desert, some 30 kilometers from the Iraq border. Anger and questions The camp has become a hotbed of anger and unanswered questions. Iraqi women wander a market, shouting loudly: “Where are our husbands? Why don’t they release them? Why won’t the Baghdad government take us back?” As of 2018, more than 50,000 Iraqis had voluntarily returned to their homes, revealed Adnan al-Obeidi, head of the Iraqi refugee council in al-Hol. However, a year and a half ago, Iraqi authorities have been refusing to take in any more refugees. The camp management said more than 20,000 want to go back home, but only under the supervision of United Nations and international humanitarian agencies out of their fear of reprisals from the PMF, which controls several Iraqi regions. Obeidi revealed that his office has handed the Baghdad government a list with the names of refugees. The list was submitted through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and International Committee of the Red Cross and “each time, we receive approval to return the refugees, but the process is always aborted for unknown reasons.” Camp director Majida Amine told Asharq Al-Awsat that diplomatic coordination was ongoing between the autonomous authority in northeastern Syria and the Iraq government. Various pledges were made to allow the refugees to return to their homes. In early 2019, Iraq stopped receiving refugees willing to go back home. She said Iraq was to blame for the halt. “We have submitted lists of voluntary refugees months ago and we have yet to receive approval.” She described the situation in al-Hol as “very difficult and disastrous” because tens of thousands of people were in dire need of help. Many have witnessed atrocities, war and indescribable suffering, both physical and psychological. The Iraqis need safety, shelter, food and health care that is lacking in the camp.

"138",2711,"https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/04/04/us-hands-over-another-air-base-to-iraqi-forces/","US hands over another air base to Iraqi forces","The U.S. handed over the al-Taqaddum Air Base to Iraqi forces on Saturday — it’s the fourth base to be handed over to Iraqi Security Forces over the last several weeks. The al-Taqaddum Air Base is located between Ramadi and Fallujah. The coalition says the base transfers are a result of success against ISIS. “These pre-planned base transfers are not related to recent attacks against Iraqi bases hosting Coalition troops, or the ongoing COVID-19 situation in Iraq,” Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a news release. The coalition has been consolidating troops across a number of smaller outposts to bigger bases. Some coalition troops have left Iraq as a result of COVID-19. The coalition has also been criticized for its inability to protect bases from rocket attacks believed to be orchestrated by Iran-backed militias. An attack on Camp Taji in March resulted in the deaths of two U.S. troops and one U.K. service member. “The transfer of Taqaddum (Habbaniya) air base is another step forward in the ongoing partnership between Iraqi Security Forces and the anti-ISIS international military Coalition,” Brig. Gen. Vincent Barker, OIR director of sustainment, said in a news release. “Over the last month we have transferred four bases to full ISF control. This wouldn’t be possible without the ISF’s proven capability to bring the fight to ISIS,"" Barker said in the release. The U.S. previously handed over al-Qaim, the Qayyarah West Airfield and the Kirkuk installation. Kirkuk was the scene of a deadly rocket attack in Dec. 2019 that killed an American contractor. The rocket attack carried out by an Iran-backed militia nearly sparked a war between Tehran and the U.S. The al-Taqqadum Air Base has hosted U.S. Marines, Italian, Canadian and Spanish forces, OIR said. Coalition advisers used the base to help Iraqi forces wrestle control of Ramadi and Fallujah from ISIS in 2016. “The Coalition will operate from fewer locations, but remains committed to supporting our partners in their fight against Daesh,” OIR said in the release. Coalition troops will depart al-Taqqadum in the coming days as equipment is transferred to Iraqi forces, OIR said. Shawn Snow is the senior reporter for Marine Corps Times and a Marine Corps veteran.

""This is very sensitive, very difficult for our society,"" said Dr. Wissam Cona, who works with the provincial health department in the city of Najaf in southern Iraq. He now spends his days checking on families recently returned from Iran, which has suffered one of the world's most severe outbreaks of the coronavirus. He said that the father of the family at this home had begged him not to come with a retinue of health workers, saying, ""'Please don't park in front of our house. I feel ashamed in front of the neighbors. This is so difficult for my reputation.'"" For Iraq, one of the biggest obstacles for public health officials fighting the coronavirus is the stigma associated with illness and quarantine. It runs so deep that people avoid being tested, prevent family members who want tests from having them and delay seeking medical help until they are catastrophically ill. The aversion to quarantine and the reluctance to admit illness may help explain why the number of confirmed cases in Iraq is relatively low, several Iraqi doctors said. A country of more than 38 million people, Iraq had recorded only 1,352 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Monday. By contrast, in neighboring Iran, with roughly twice Iraq's population, the official count exceeds 71,000. Neighboring Saudi Arabia, which has a smaller population than Iraq's, has more than three times as many confirmed cases. ""It is true we have cases that are hidden, and that is because people don't want to come forward and they are afraid of the quarantine and isolation,"" said Dr. Hazim Al Jumaili, a deputy health minister who is guiding the country's response to the coronavirus. The stigma attached to illness and quarantine in Iraq and some other Middle Eastern countries largely reflects cultural and religious beliefs. But it also involves an ingrained distrust of the government, historical experience and the fear that given the ragged state of Iraq's health care system, going to the hospital could be fatal. A recent video that was widely shared showed women patients in quarantine in a Basra hospital lying near each other without masks, coughing and calling for help as one of them died. ""Some believe the virus means that God is displeased with them, or maybe it is a punishment for a sin so they don't want others to see that they are sick,"" said Dr. Emad Abdul Razzak, a consultant psychiatrist at Iraq's Health Ministry. ""For many people it is a shame for a female to say she has this illness or any illness, even cancer or mental illness, and many people have no trust in the health system,"" he said. So strong are the stigma and the aura of sinfulness surrounding the virus that families of those who have died of other causes oppose their loved ones' bodies being in the same morgue or even graveyard as those who have died of the virus. In contrast to many Western countries, where celebrities have acknowledged having the disease, and even neighboring Iran, where senior political figures announced they were ill with the virus, there is only one instance in Iraq of a politician or prominent figure admitting to being infected. Some of the fear surrounding the disease stems from the Muslim rituals surrounding death, said Sherine Hamdy, a professor of medical anthropology at the University of California at Irvine who has worked extensively in Middle Eastern communities. ""You don't want to be forced into quarantine, you don't want to be forced into the hospital because those social, family bonds are very strong,"" she said. ""You want to die within the family. ""The worst thing in the world isn't to die, but it's to die away from your family and your community and to have no control over what happens to your body."" The Islamic tradition requires swift burial, preferably within 24 hours of death. The longer the delay, the more people fear for the soul of the deceased. Adding to the problems is the tradition of washing the bodies of people who have just died, which the authorities fear could spread the virus. ""The coronavirus and pandemics overall cause disruptions of social and religious practices, and it's not easy to tell people that the coronavirus is stronger than God,"" said Omar Dewachi, a professor of medical anthropology at Rutgers University, who was born and brought up in Iraq. Quarantining those who are infected imposes a double humiliation in many Iraqi communities. First, it assures that everyone in the neighborhood will learn about the illness. Second, if the victim is an adult male, it signifies that he is no longer able to protect his wife, his children or in the case of an elder brother, his younger siblings, and so has fallen short of fulfilling his role in the family. More traditional families sometimes deny their female relatives a coronavirus test for fear that if she tests positive she will be removed from the fortress of her family and possibly be sexually compromised. ""In this society, it is not OK for a female to be apart from the family,"" said Dr. Mona Al Khafaji, a radiologist in private practice in Baghdad. She mentioned the case of a 32-year-old female patient with fibrosis, which heightens her vulnerability to the coronavirus, who was having trouble breathing. Al Khafaji recommended the woman go for a COVID-19 test, but her father and brothers said no, and refused to budge even when her condition worsened. Lately, in an effort to overcome the stigma and put together an accurate picture of the scope of the epidemic, the Iraqi Health Ministry has resorted to random testing. But this program has brought a new set of troubles. For one thing, some healthy people could be falsely stigmatized. And to display its resolve, the government has assigned armed national security personnel to accompany health workers. Given Iraq's violent past, the presence of security forces is so unnerving it makes some people hide in their homes. ""It is so difficult in this culture because everything we do is a problem,"" said Dr. Mohammed Waheeb, a senior pulmonologist at Baghdad Medical City. ""If we send an ambulance to pick up the patient, then people are upset because the neighbors will see it."" ""The same happens or worse if we send the national security,"" he added. ""Then people feel it is like under Saddam,"" he said, referring to Iraq's former strongman president, Saddam Hussein. The Health Ministry says the use of security personnel is the only way to surmount the difficulties of persuading people to submit to quarantine. Doctors, however, say the security details are needlessly off-putting, at least when health teams are merely out collecting samples. The second day of random testing in Sadr City, a sprawling, impoverished neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, illustrated the recurring problems. In this part of the capital, houses are patched heaps of corrugated metal and brick, with garbage strewn on streets that are often unpaved. An old woman, wearing a long black abaya, opened her corrugated metal gate a crack and squinted into the brilliant noonday sun to see who had knocked. Looking down the street she saw more than 40 people - in surgical gowns and masks or full hazmat suits, accompanied by two or three television cameras, community police officers, young militia members from the organization of the nationalist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and a few local sheikhs. She slammed the gate closed. People in Sadr City are skeptical of the Health Ministry, said Dr. Bassim Aboud, who oversees the area for the ministry, as he knocked futilely at the woman's gate. ""If people think I am with the government, they will shut the door,"" he said. ""But if they see me as a doctor, they come to me for help.

The Corona in Iraq platform was originally developed by local web developer Mustafa Alwan, a member of CS50x-Iraq Developers Union which contains a pool of computer science and programming experts from Harvard University’s CS50 developers’ training program. Alwan designed the platform to support his country’s mission to tackle the spread of COVID19. When UNDP Iraq’s Accelerator Lab team – whose role it is to identify and upscale locally-designed solutions that attempt to solve a country’s most pressing challenges – discovered Corona in Iraq, the potential to develop it was tangible, present, and exciting. Iraq is one of 60 teams across UNDP’s global network of labs sourcing local solutions to respond to global challenges. “Absolutely take it to the next level!” was the initial reaction of UNDP Iraq’s Resident Representative, Zena Ali-Ahmad when the Accelerator Lab team pitched the idea. “In Iraq, misinformation about the virus is a huge challenge, and rumors are circulating within the community. Corona in Iraq is an innovative way to quell some of these rumors and provide people with real facts and necessary courses of actions if they feel they may have the virus,” she said. Stigma associated with COVID-19 is also prevalent in Iraq, with many people refraining from seeking medical advice due to a fear that, if tested positive or if perceived to have the virus, they would be shunned and discriminated against by their communities. “Through a portal that tracks symptoms, users are encouraged to speak up and consult medical professionals if they contain symptoms. This simple action is extremely important as we support the Government of Iraq in their efforts to limit the spread of the virus across the country,” adds Ms. Ali-Ahmad. Key features of Corona in Iraq: Raises awareness about the symptoms and risks of COVID-19 and dispels rumors about the virus. Corona in Iraq draws from the most up-to-date information and data from the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains localized information including statistics on the number of reported cases and fatalities in Iraq. It also provides information on how to stay hygienic and healthy in everyday life. A partnership with UNICEF will soon allow information specific to Iraqi youth, with an opportunity for young people to submit questions about the virus. This critical feature comes at a time when many young people are feeling anxious due to the strict curfews imposed across the country, limiting their schooling and social life. Tracks symptoms to encourage people to seek medical advice Stigma can be heightened by insufficient knowledge about how COVID-19 is transmitted and treated, and how to prevent infection. By using Corona in Iraq, users are able to track their symptoms through a multiple-choice questionnaire containing 10 simple questions. This feature fosters a testing culture, encouraging users to speak to a health professional if they are experiencing symptoms, which ultimately helps to prevent stigma associated with the virus. Geographical scanning of COVID-19 hotspots Also included on the platform is a geographical scanning feature which maps out the geographical spread of the virus across the entire country and the most affected areas that require increased support, such as sterilization and fumigation. This information helps government agencies effectively respond to the virus. UNDP Iraq’s response to COVID-19 The Corona in Iraq platform is part of UNDP’s US$25 million response package which supports the Government of Iraq to manage the coronavirus pandemic by helping to provide personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, building isolation wards to effectively manage cases, boost the testing capacity of hospitals, and undertake critical assessments to inform Iraq’s post-COVID-19 recovery strategy.

"143",2806,"https://cpj.org/2020/04/iraqi-regulator-suspends-reuters-license-for-3-mon/","Iraqi regulator suspends Reutersâ€™ license for 3 months over COVID-19 report - Committee to Protect Journalists","April 3, 2020 10:25 AM EDT New York, April 3, 2020 — Iraqi authorities should immediately reinstate the license of the Reuters news agency, and allow all media outlets to cover the COVID-19 pandemic freely, the Committee to Protect Journalists said today. Yesterday, the Communications and Media Commission, Iraq’s media regulator, suspended Reuters’ license for three months and fined it 25 million Iraqi dinars ($21,000) for a news report published the same day, which alleged that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country are much higher than official statistics, according to a statement from the regulator and news reports. In its statement, the regulator accused Reuters of relying on vague and untrue sources to fabricate news about pandemic in Iraq, and accused Reuters of endangering public safety and hindering the government’s efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. It also urged Reuters to issue a public apology to the government and the Iraqi people. “If Iraq’s media regulator continues to suspend media outlets critical of the authorities, soon there won’t be any outlet left in Iraq at a time when the flow of news is vital to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease,” said CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa Representative Ignacio Miguel Delgado. “We call on Iraq´s media regulator to restore Reuters’ license and allow its staff to do their jobs freely and without fear of reprisal.” The Reuters report cited three doctors involved in the COVID-19 testing process, a health ministry official, and a senior political official, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because medical staff have been instructed not to speak to the media. Those sources alleged that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was thousands higher than the official count of 772. After the report was published, the Iraqi government on its official Twitter account criticized “some news agencies” for falsely claiming that the numbers disclosed by authorities were inaccurate. In a statement sent to CPJ via messaging app, Reuters said it had not received any notification from Iraqi authorities regarding the license and was seeking clarification on the matter. The news agency said it stands by the story. Iraq has also suspended the printing and distribution of newspapers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to news reports. Yemen, Oman, Jordan, Morocco, and Iran have similarly banned newspapers, as CPJ has documented. On April 1, the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission issued a series of new regulations restricting the movement and work of journalists and media outlets, forcing radio stations and broadcasters to reduce their staff to a minimum, requiring journalists and media workers to wear protective gear, and providing the Joint Operations Command and the Baghdad Operations Command with a list of licensed radio stations and broadcasters, according to news reports and the local press freedom group the Press Freedom Advocacy Association in Iraq. The Media and Communications Commission did not immediately reply to CPJ’s request for comment sent via email and social media. CPJ is a 501(c)3 non-profit. Our EIN is 13-3081500.

In a statement released on April 9, the mysterious group called on both ambassadors to flee from the country within 48 hours threateniing to kill them. “According to the information, which we received, US forces of evil are planning to carry out an attack against the blessed Islamic resistance factions and the Iraqi people. So we tell them that out eyes are monitoring you everywhere… and to the US and British ambassadors in Baghdad [we say] if you don’t leave Iraq within 48 hours, you will be leaving dead [in body bags]. Forewarned is forearmed,” the statement reads. Click to see full-size image. The new faction is named after a group of Shiite scholars who were executed by the Saddam regime in 1974. The five scholars, headed by al-Arif al-Busri, were among the very first leaders of the Islamic Dawa Party that later supported the Islamic Revolution in Iran. QH is one of a few armed factions which were formed or emerged following the assassination of Popular Mobilization Units Deputy Commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Iran’s Quds Force Commander Maj. Gen. Qassam Soleimani in January 2020. Usbat al-Tha’ireen (UT), the faction that claimed responsibility for the March 11 rocket attack on the US-operated military base Camp Taji, was among the first groups that became active after the incident. Another group is ‘Ashab al-Kahf (AK). This group allegedly attacked a military convoy of U.S. forces in Saladin earlier this week. Other large Shiite armed group like Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH) have been threatening U.S. forces for a while now. However, they are yet to take any direct military action. The U.S.-led coalition has taken these threats seriously. It has withdrawn a large part of its troops and redeployed others to well-protected bases. These measures will not likely be very successful, if Iraqi factions decide to go for an “open war” with U.S. forces.

According to RojNews agency, ISIS mercenaries attacked the Iraqi soldiers on Mount Qereçox in the countryside of Maxmur district in Mosul governorate on Sunday. The attack in the area between the villages of Eliresh and Berdispi left two soldiers of the Iraqi army dead. Reports say that a military operation was launched in the area following the attack. Mount Qereçox is located directly behind the Maxmur refugee camp in the district of the same name, which since the independence referendum in autumn 2017 has been one of the disputed areas of the country to which the Kurdish regional government in Hewlêr (Erbil) has laid claim. On Mount Qereçox there is an ISIS base to which many jihadists have retreated after the military victory over the militia more than a year ago in northern and eastern Syria. The international anti-ISIS coalition has since carried out several air strikes against ISIS positions on the mountain. In early February, an ISIS group coming from Mount Qereçox attacked the Maxmur camp, injuring three residents. The attack had been repulsed by a guerrilla unit of the HPG, two jihadists were killed. Guerrilla fighter Ahmed Muradpur (Bekês Urmiye) was also killed in the fighting. Home | Contact | RSS Feed | Copyright © Ajansa Nûçeyan a Firatê 2022. All Rights Reserved","none","none",0,0,0,0

The 93-year-old architect and photographer was credited with designing some of Iraq’s most well-known structures, including the iconic “Freedom Monument” in the now protest hub of Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. “He was a giant of 20th century Iraq,” said Caecilia Pieri, a scholar focusing on Baghdad’s modern architecture who knew Chadirji well. Top Iraqi officials including President Barham Saleh and caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi mourned him on Saturday. “With the death of Rifat Chadirji, architecture in Iraq and the world has lost its modern lung,” Saleh wrote. Born in Baghdad in 1926, Chadirji studied in London and returned to Iraq in the 1950s to design his magnum opus – an elegant arch entitled “The Unknown Soldier” – as well as the capital’s post office and other public buildings. But when the Baathist regime came to power, it tore down “The Unknown Soldier,” replaced it with a statue of Saddam Hussein and tossed Chadirji into the infamous Abu Ghraib prison, where he remained for 20 months. He wrote about the experience in The Wall Between Two Darknesses, relating how Saddam had him released from prison to design a conference center. Chadirji moved to Beirut a few years later and lived abroad during most of the devastating 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, the 1990 Gulf War, a decade of international sanctions and the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam. When he returned to Iraq in 2009, he was scarred by what he found. “I cannot believe what has happened to the buildings in Baghdad, everything has been almost completely destroyed,” Chadirji said at the time. In 2019, another one of his famed buildings was torn down: the National Insurance Company in Mosul, a seven-story building from where the Islamic State group thew men accused of being gay to their deaths. The structure was ravaged by the months-long fight to oust IS from Mosul and a municipal committee later decided to demolish what was left of it, saying it could not be restored. The NIC building was seen as a prime example of modern Iraqi design, with rows of slim archways and projected windows reminiscent of Iraq’s beloved “shanasheel.” Chadirji had been a longtime advocate of preservation, working even under Saddam to halt the demolition of traditional Iraqi architecture in Baghdad. “A people that cannot take care of its creations is a people without a memory,” he said in 2009. – AFP This site, like many others, uses small files called cookies to help us improve and customize your experience.

"148",2903,"https://ekurd.net/iraqi-kurdistan-government-krg-2020-04-25","Iraqi Kurdistan government KRG and the spread of COVID-19","An old Kurdish man wearing a protective mask in Erbil after coronavirus outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, April 2020. Photo: Rudaw Dana Berzinjy | Exclusive to Ekurd.net When the scary coronavirus was spread in the world, some countries stopped public work hours to prevent the virus from getting spread. That was a clever strategy in order to save tens of thousand lives from getting the deadly virus. The Kurdish Regional Government showed a list of protective measures, including closing down hairdresser’s, beauty stores, and bars that offer alcohol, started on 13th March and it has been extended up to 10th of May 2020. The government commanded its citizens to obey the guidelines that were announced by the KRG’s health minister. Since the new political system was introduced after 2003, protests have targeted corruption undertaken by particular personalities who hold or held political power. These protests were a result of a failure to meet the people’s demands, which include a right level of wealth for all Iraqis without distinguish. The situation became so severe those basic services such as clean water, electricity, and other infrastructural projects failed to materialize. While Iraq and Kurdistan are very rich in natural resources, such as crude oil, gas but unfortunately, the Iraqi people including, Kurds, Assyrians, Arabs, Armenians, and Turkmen never experienced the full benefits of the natural resources offer. Poverty, corruption and fraud have been spread like a skyrocket among the government officials due to lack of good authority and the penetration of selfishness. Generally speaking the Iraqi people from north that is the city of Sulaimani up to Basra in south of Iraq do not trust the governments. Trust has been rusted badly and has a disgusting smell. So, the lack of trust and corruption in Iraq as a whole country absorbed a huge fraction of Iraq’s budget, which otherwise could have been used to support the weak and poor Iraqi people. So, let me just talk about Iraqi Kurdistan as an example of Iraq, which rules by Kurdish regional Government, (KRG). As we know the KRG has locked down all the shops without exception, even the Covid-19 according to the Kurdish TV Channels has killed four people and even the researchers were denied to be involved in any researches by some of the lecturers at university due to unknown reasons or national security excuse which has no any scientific bases. The KRG has closed all the shops including the pharmacies without having a plan or good preparation or leaving a space for poor people to move, or ask for help in case if someone is getting sick, they have not provided ambulances for people when they need it or to call an emergency numbers. I heard from one of the Kurdish citizens who asked for help due to having a sick person at home, but the hospital asked to get 50,000 Iraqi dinner for ambulance service, even the person was unemployed and did not have money to pay. So, unfortunately, KRG as a corrupted government has no plans whatsoever to support the people that live in Kurdistan. Imagine 70% of people rely on themselves without getting any financial support from the government. Say the population in Iraqi Kurdistan is 6 million people from this number 1, 200,000 people getting salary from the government, but I could say more than 80% of this salary goes to peshmerga and their supporters. Around 4,800,000 people locked up in their houses without essential and necessity support such as foods, medicine, clean water, financial support, and even there is not 24 hours electricity service is available. According to the NRT Kurdish TV channel one of the parents took her child to hospital, but the hospital did not have oxygen device in order to accept the child at the hospital. The mother started to give her child oxygen manually and the device is very similar to a balloon. I cannot believe a government has been running Kurdish Region for 29 years and was not able to buy a single oxygen device for the ministry of health. So, we have 4,800,000 people locked up in their premises with no basic resources, the majority of this people have shops, such butchers, green grocers, bakeries, grocers and so on. These shop owners paying rents, electricity bills, city council fees, sign fees, telephone lines, Internet and paying other taxes to the government. But, during this lockdown period these people have not got any income support or getting any financial help from the government in order to buy foods for their families on the daily bases and pay their bills. Even the KRG has asked people to support the government and the rich people gave the KRG over $20m, but still the government has not supported anyone financially even the public employees got paid their salaries after 5o days. In Iraqi Kurdistan we have so many farmers, they look after their farms, sheep, goats, hens, and cows in order to benefit from their products and sell them in the market. But, unfortunately, this corrupted KRG has not allowed the farmers to go back to their villages even to water their farms. As I mentioned it before, some of the shop owners threw out their meat, greens and products because they went off in their shops. The KRG does not take any responsibilities, but it is easy for them to lock up people in their houses without having any necessary resources to live on it. So this lockdown does not cost them a cent, and still begging to get help from Iraq or from the rest of the world. At the same time, the KRG is laundering people’s money to other countries such as Lebanon as we heard the news from the Lebanese TV and Kurdish channels. The illegal money was around $1b US dollars. I can not believe that KRG has been running the region since 1991, but the government has not kept a few billion dollars to spend it in a dark day like this and give it to vulnerable people such as handicapped people, retirees, farmers and shop owners. The entire world, including every state on this planet has got a great plan and provided a huge budget in order to get through this covid19 crisis, and to support their own citizens. I have mentioned Australia and Canada in this article in order to support my argument. Australian Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan delivered a higher education relief package to Australian students. The minister decided to provide 20,000 places short courses to cover nursing, teaching, health, IT and science. Australian universities will keep the $18 billion as planned for this year irrespective of any fall in enrolments The package also will include backing for new short courses for the unemployed people, and $100 million in directing relief for education providers. This is a great opportunity plan for everyone, especially unemployed people to use their time to study the above courses. But unfortunately, the KRG, Education Minster and a Minister of Higher Education and Scientific research have not provided even a dollar for Education system in Iraqi Kurdistan. What the KRG has done just shut down the gates of schools and universities without any plans. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also decided to fund from $1bn to cover industries battling the negative consequences of coronavirus, such as tourism, agriculture and education. But the KRG’s Prime Minister is very quiet in that regard. The Federal government has more plans by including that the tax office will provide administrative relief for some tax duties for people influenced by the coronavirus epidemic. The Australian Federal government has broadcasted a 2nd major economic release package as well, it worth $66 bn; in addition of the initial package that was $17.6 bn. The government also provided more than $100 bn in emergency banking measures to stop against a credit restriction. In this great Australian support package applies to small business and also includes a major boost to welfare receivers and for people who lose work as a result of the Covid19 pandemic. The entire economic support the government promised and obligated, it worth $189bn. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison will support Australian economy in case Covid19 crisis continues. In this package the government published that 6.5 million lower-income Australians will get a one-off $750 payment intended at domestic demand in the economy, costing the budget $4.76bn. So this $750 payment will be paid from 31 March to all social security, veteran and other income support receivers and eligible concession cardholders, and families receiving family tax benefits. I believe half of those that will benefit from this package are pensioners. But in Iraqi Kurdistan none of the unemployed people got paid even a dollar and the pensioners get paid their salaries in 50- 60 days instead of 30 days. Then, I have to stop here and ask the KRG and say, where are all the funds that you get from selling gas, oil, and the fund you get from the Iraqi Federal Government and all the taxes that you collect locally and internationally from Iran, Turkey and other countries from commercial activities in all the borders. Canada is also has passed a multi-billion-dollar relief package to respond to the coronavirus slowdown. So, the government permits to spend C$107bn ($75bn, £64bn) to support Canadian economy and incentive to help Canadian citizens that are struggling economically. This package provided to improve child benefit payments to families have children, wage grants for small business, and tax relief measures. The bill would give C$2,000 a month for the next four months for those people who lost their job due Covid-19. The support will be given to people who are isolated, and supporting ill family members. At the end I want to say the KRG does not take any accountabilities as a government, but the government’s duty is just to make a life harder for it’s citizens. This recent KRG’s Cabinet Ministers has no plans for the country because they are just carrying out their duties as a spay or they have been employed to work for their neighborhood states for instance Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. According to what the UN Security Council saying that “Adopting Resolution 2417 (2018), Security Council Strongly Condemns Starving of Civilians, Unlawfully Denying Humanitarian Access as Warfare Tactics.” I believe KRG falls under the UN Security Council rules and it is going to be liable under International Laws by making it’s people to starve for food or basic essential necessities.

Kadhimi, who is not affiliated with any Iraqi political party, is the third candidate for the post since Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned in November 2019 in response to widespread anti-government protests. Prior to his appointment as intelligence director, Kadhimi worked as a journalist and was previously editor of Al-Monitor’s Iraq Pulse. Salih’s first choice, Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi, a former communications minister, withdrew March 1 after failing to reach agreement on a new Cabinet within 30 days. Kadhimi appears to have widespread backing for his candidacy among Iraq’s key political parties. Salih described Kadhimi as a “patriot and cultural figure … well known for his integrity, moderation [and] giving consideration for all Iraqis regarding their general rights."" The United States and Iran both reacted relatively positively to Kadhimi’s appointment last week. US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said April 9, “If Kadhimi is an Iraqi nationalist, if he is dedicated to pursuing a sovereign Iraq, if he is committed to fighting corruption, this would be great for Iraq, and I think it would be great for our bilateral relationship.” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi welcomed “the consensus reached among Iraqi political groups today, resulting in the designation of Mr. al-Kadhimi as the new prime minister of Iraq, and considers it as a right step in the right direction.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred April 7 to the United States as “Iraq’s closest friend” when he announced a renewal of the US-Iraq “strategic dialogue” in June, to be led on the US side by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale. Schenker, in his remarks, said the threat from Iranian-backed militias to US forces in Iraq remains “significant,” adding that the strategic dialogue would encompass a wide range of financial, economic, security and diplomatic issues.
