The federal government's chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy confirmed the woman is in isolation and had tested positive to the virus in preliminary examinations. 'She is in isolation until the final confirmation. But NSW Health feel she's likely to be the fifth case in the country,' Prof Murphy said. Health authorities are now working to track down people the woman came into contact with and potentially infected. The news comes after three men in New South Wales, aged 43, 53 and 35, and one Victorian man aged in his 50s, caught the deadly disease. A 21-year-old woman has been taken to hospital after fears she may have contracted the deadly coronavirus The virus, which experts fear will 'highly likely' continue to spread in Australia, has so far killed 56 people in China and infected 2,000 people worldwide. Since the outbreak at the end of December, Chinese authorities have placed 56 million people in lockdown - including more than 100 Australian children aged between six months and 16 years old, the ABC reported. Photos taken outside Westmead Hospital on Sunday show a woman wearing a face mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and clothing. Prof Murphy said there would likely be more cases in the country. 'There is no cause for general concern,' Prof Murphy said in Melbourne on Sunday. 'I would not be surprised if there are some more cases... it's highly likely that we may see some more. 'We are incredibly well prepared to isolate and deal with that.' Emma Wei, from Melbourne, is trapped in Wuhan with her two children amid China's lockdown Medical staff are seen wearing protective clothing outside a hospital in Wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak NEW SOUTH WALES: 4 Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman. January 25 January 27 VICTORIA: 4 January 25 January 29 January 30 She is being treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital. February 1 A Melbourne woman aged in her 20s is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. She was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. QUEENSLAND: 2 January 29 January 30 SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 2 February 1 A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital. The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia. SA Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test. Australia has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no need for current concern. In the wake of the rapid spread, Chinese-Australian parents are now desperate for their children to get out of Wuhan in China's Hubei province. Yi Xu is demanding his six-month-old daughter be brought home to Australia. 'The Australian Government needs to follow what the US is doing [and] to charter a plane to evacuate its citizens for emergency,' Mr Xu told the ABC after reports the U.S was using a plane to evacuate Americans from the area. A father from Melbourne, Nathan Wang, said his 11-month-old daughter is stuck in Wuhan with his wife and other child. Mr Wang said his family was struggling to access medical resources. 'I can't even fall asleep. As a father, I was very desperate. I am guilty that all of the risks and pressure were put on my wife alone,' he said. Another Chinese-Australian man said the children who were left stranded in the areas were being cared for by their grandparents. 'They are desperate to get out, because there starts to see a shortage of face masks and other protective supplies,' the man who only wanted to be referred to as John told The Australian. 'Many children are running out of baby formula powders soon,' he said. The Australian government is now considering options to allow Australians in the infected areas to travel. A China Eastern Flight from Wuhan arrives at Sydney International Airport on Thursday where health authorities were screening passengers for coronavirus 'The Government acknowledges the concerns of Australians who are in Hubei Province in China and the concerns of their families and friends,' Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement on Sunday. Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms. If and when they do, typical signs include: The vast majority of patients – at least 97 per cent, based on available data – will recover from these without any issues or medical help. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. 'The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions. 'Given the circumstances of the spread of the Coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers. 'Our Embassy in Beijing and our Consulate in Shanghai are also working with international partners and the Chinese government to determine what support can be given to Australians on the ground.' Authorities are urging anyone who has travelled to the Wuhan region and experienced flu-like symptoms to contact their GP or local emergency department. The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers. A passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first Australian case of coronavirus He became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia on Saturday morning and is now in quarantined isolation at Monash Hospital in Clayton in Melbourne's east. Earlier on Saturday a baby was rushed from Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared of the virus. A Hobart man has tested negative for coronavirus on Sunday after he was admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital on Saturday with mild respiratory symptoms. The man in his 30s had travelled to China earlier this month and spent time Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began. He contacted a general practitioner with respiratory problems and was admitted into an isolation room in hospital while tests were conducted to rule out the infection. Public Health services identified the man's contacts since returning to Hobart in case he had been identified as carrying the virus. The man has been discharged from hospital after his results showed he was not infected. What is this virus? The virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory infections such as the common cold. But coronaviruses can also be deadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the early 2000s. Can it kill? Yes. 56 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus. What are the symptoms? Its symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some patients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. People carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such as a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek medical attention, experts fear. How is it detected? The virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the rest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose potential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to disease outbreaks. To contain the virus, airports are detecting infected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because symptoms have not appeared yet. How did it start and spread? The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission. What are countries doing to prevent the spread? Countries in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. Australia and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan. Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before? Experts have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere  Share what you think The comments below have been moderated in advance.

A group of 135 Chinese PhD students and 30 other visiting students sent an email to the state-owned Global Times tabloid newspaper, saying they had all experienced lengthy delays on their Australian student visa applications. The claims follow several reports last year detailing concern over the national security impacts of university research collaborations with Chinese entities. Australia's top universities could be aiding the Chinese Communist Party's mission to develop mass surveillance and military technologies. In response, universities adopted new voluntary guidelines to combat foreign interference and risky research partnerships. One of the would-be postgraduate students said they had been left hanging for 17 months, while the majority said they had waited more than five months since applying. Most of the students were studying in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) related fields, the newspaper reported. On its website, the Department says 90 per cent of applicants for postgraduate research visas receive a decision within four months. So are the long-waiting times due to ""paranoid voices against China"" in Canberra — as the Global Times suggested in a follow-up editorial — or is it just a case of bureaucratic bungling? The affected students told Chinese media their scholarships had expired, or were coming close to expiring, while they waited for Home Affairs to make a decision on their visas. They blamed their troubles on the cool relations between Beijing and Canberra, and the ongoing debate over Chinese political influence in Australia. Inside a massive cyber attack on the Australian National University that risks compromising high-ranking officials across the globe. Asked whether national security concerns were driving the alleged visa slow-down, Home Affairs told the ABC processing times were driven by a range of factors, including ""assessments in relation to health, character and national security requirements"". ""These requirements are not new and they are not specific to Chinese nationals,"" Home Affairs said in a statement. It said the student visa grant rate for visa applicants for Chinese postgraduate students was 98.9 per cent, which was slightly higher than the overall grant rate of 98.6 per cent. The University of Melbourne told the ABC it was supporting prospective PhD students ""from various countries"" experiencing slower-than-expected processing times. In a statement, it said there were in many cases ""considerable delays"" in getting their visas approved. ""[The University of Melbourne] is communicating with the Government about this matter to help them to understand the problems caused for the students and for the University by these delays,"" it said. Adam Ni, co-editor of the China analysis newsletter China Neican, told the ABC the main concern was that individuals could be linked to the Chinese Government, and conduct espionage including transferring sensitive technology to authorities there. ""At a broad level, there is increasing anxiety about Chinese party state influence and interference in Australia, this has extended into research collaboration, and recently into individuals that are conducting research,"" Mr Ni said. ""Certainly the cases are quite disturbing that came to light over the last decade about researchers that are conducting espionage or somehow infringing intellectual property."" A joint investigation by Four Corners, The Age and Sydney Morning Herald reveals fresh and compelling evidence of covert Beijing-backed political activity taking place in Australia. But Mr Ni said Australia should be cautious but not overreact, or else run the risk of creating ""an environment of distrust"". ""The problem was just a few individuals that had links to the [Communist] Party, rather than a whole body of researchers,"" he said. ""There are still tremendous advantages from research collaboration and having an influx of Chinese students, a whole range of benefits that are really important to Australia's national interest.""

Chinese authorities expanded the travel restrictions on Saturday to cover 56 million Chinese, Al Jazeera reports. At least 18 cities in central Hubei are now dealing with at least some level of travel restrictions. In Wuhan, the situation looks grim. The number of confirmed cases is exploding: another 300 were announced on Saturday, while the death toll is steady at 41. Yesterday, videos flooded Western social media (after being assiduously removed from Weibo and the rest of the Chinese Internet) purporting to show bodies piling up in hallways in Wuhan, with rumors that a doctor had succumbed to the virus. Those rumors have now been confirmed: A doctor who worked at a hospital in Wuhan, China, where coronavirus patients are being treated died Saturday morning, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, a two-year-old Chinese girl has become the youngest to be diagnosed with the virus. As it has all week, the South China Morning Post has kept an up-to-date running total of the confirmed cases & deaths. As of 10 am ET on Saturday, the total number stood at exactly 1400.  A map of the various cases shows the spread, though even the most up-to-date maps by Western news agencies appear to already be out of date, including this one by BBG.  Though China has pledged transparency, some suspect that the true tally of cases within Wuhan is much higher. With the epidemic spiraling out of control, President Xi called a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, a group of China’s top leaders, to discuss a response to the virus. At the meeting, the Communist Party set up a group to manage the response to the virus. The group will comprise members of the Party’s Central Committee, while being directed by the Standing Committee. During the meeting, President Xi said various ethnic groups must work together to contain the spread of the deadly virus. Xi also ordered party authorities to ensure that there are enough medical supplies in Wuhan – the capital of Hubei province and a city of 11 million five times the size of London and bigger than any US city. “Party committees and governments at different levels have to make proper plans to contain the virus under the guidance of the Central Committee,” he was quoted as saying. China’s National Health Commission announced on Saturday a nationwide plan to identify suspected cases of the deadly virus on trains, airplanes and buses. Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia will be “immediately transported” to a medical center. In the city of Haikou, the authorities said they would set up a 14-day observation center for all tourists who came from Hubei. They will not be allowed to leave the hotels where they are staying. At least 450 additional military and medical personnel have been deployed in Hubei to help with the situation. Following reports last night of a suspected case in Sydney, Australian authorities have confirmed the first case of the virus. Yesterday, several cases were also identified in France. But that’s not all: Malaysia has confirmed that three cases of the virus have been detected. Japan is now up to three cases, all Chinese nationals, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. Following reports that the virus may have originated from people eating bats or rats, the party has ordered more inspections of agricultural products, and has temporarily banned the trade in wild animals. It has also shut down movie theaters, LNY-related events and other mass gatherings across the country, warning that people should avoid coming together en mass until the outbreak is contained. Qinghai province in northwestern China confirmed its first case on Saturday, leaving Tibet as the only administrative area of China that remains virus-free. In Wuhan, the horror stories are getting worse: One woman told the SCMP that her husband was turned away by several hospitals despite coughing up blood, a sign of very advanced pneumonia. “I have nothing. No protective clothing, only a raincoat, and I am standing outside the hospital in the rain,” said the woman, who gave her name as Xiaoxi. “I am desperate, I have lost count of time and days. I don’t know if we will both live to see the new year.” The rapid rise in the number of cases doesn’t necessarily mean the outbreak is getting worse, according to a spokesman from the WHO. Instead, it could reflect better monitoring and intervention by government authorities. As far as determining the severity of the epidemic, it’s still too early to say. “It’s still too early to draw conclusions about how severe the virus is because, at the beginning of any outbreak, you would focus more on the severe cases,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva. Video from inside Wuhan, a city that has been nearly entirely sealed off from the outside world, the situation appears increasingly dire.  A lot of attention has been paid in the Western press about the effort to build a new, 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan as the city’s current health-care infrastructure has been completely overwhelmed. They’re hoping to finish the building in under a week, an astonishing pace. State media reported Saturday that a second hospital will also be built.  Foreign governments including the US and Russia are hatching plans to air-lift their citizens out of Wuhan. This could include journalists covering the outbreak, meaning the flow of information out of the city could soon slow to a trickle. Meanwhile, scientists are scrambling to determine the virus’s infectious potential before victims start showing symptoms. If it’s confirmed that the virus spreads in this way, than that would make full containment virtually impossible. Article source: Zerohedge.com Subscribe for natural health news to your inbox.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago China likes to contrast its own policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries with US interference in places such as the Middle East. After the US killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on Iraqi soil last week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement urging all parties to “abide by the purposes and principles of the basic norms of international relations”. It said the US in particular should exercise restraint. Yet the latest twist in the case of Wang Liqiang, who is seeking political asylum in Australia and claims to be a former Chinese spy, provides an insight into how China is spreading its influence worldwide. The details are confusing and, like everything to do with Mr Wang, open to multiple interpretations. But, as the Herald reported this week, Mr Wang says he was the target of an extortion attempt by figures aligned with the Chinese Communist Party who wanted him to take part in a plot to influence the result of Saturday’s crucial elections in Taiwan. China insists Taiwan is part of its territory and is backing the more pro-Beijing Kuomintang Party which is currently in opposition to beat the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Mr Wang, who claims he used to run campaigns for Beijing against independence and democracy movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan, says a Kuomintang official and a Chinese businessman threatened him and offered inducements to make a video statement implicating the DPP in corruption. The story has been denied by the Kuomintang official and it raises as many questions as it answers. But Australian officials have taken the matter seriously enough to brief Taiwanese authorities about what they know. It would hardly be surprising that China is interfering in Taiwan’s internal affairs as it often threatens grave consequences if the DPP formally announces Taiwan’s independence from China. But it would be an extraordinary twist if it was trying to do so through Mr Wang, now on Australian soil and seeking Australian protection. It would be yet another sign of China’s extensive covert networks. China, through its United Front movement, uses front organisations such as student groups and business associations to harass overseas dissidents and anyone in the diaspora who opposes its policies. They target protesters against China’s breaches of human rights in Tibet and Xinjiang, and China’s creeping threat to Hong Kong’s special status and democratic institutions. Australia has taken the lead in pushing back against Chinese influence of our political system by passing one of the world’s toughest foreign interference laws. Yet the enormous value of the trade and investment between the two countries gives China leverage either directly or through individual Chinese businesses. When a Chinese businessman hands over $100,000 to a political party it is hard to know whether they are acting in their own interest or at the suggestion of the Chinese Communist Party. While vigilance is needed, it would be wrong to exaggerate the threat China poses directly to our democracy. In the current case, Australian authorities have briefed Taiwanese authorities. It shows that our institutions are quite capable of standing up to Chinese pressure. Australia also has plenty of neighbours who share our concerns. This week Indonesian President Joko Widodo travelled to islands in waters disputed by China where Indonesian and Chinese vessels have been in a stand-off for more than a month. Of course, Australia relies first and foremost on its alliance with the US to manage China’s influence. That is one more reason why Australia should counsel moderation by the US in the current instability in the Middle East. If the US stumbles unnecessarily into conflict with Iran it could distract its attention from our region and stir up anti-US hostility in Muslim countries. President Donald Trump has mostly confronted China economically by starting a tariff war against what he has called unfair trade policies. Yet in a US election year that campaign might falter. Chinese and US trade negotiators are expected to sign a ceasefire in the tariff war next week which leaves many of the underlying issues unresolved. It is certainly in the interest of the world economy for China and the US to end the uncertainty but the spread of Chinese influence around the region remains a concern. Like other countries, China has legitimate interests to defend around the world but its contempt for democracy, its wealth and the dizzying technological tools at the disposal of its secret services increase the challenge of responding to it. Australia needs to work closely with the US and be prepared to take a firm stand in cases, perhaps like Mr Wang’s, where China has gone too far.

Before going aground on the island's shore, the boat, which sailed from the coastal province of Jiangsu in China, has reportedly been floating in the waters near Rote Timur district after an Australian patrol vessel drove it away from its territory. Rote Ndao Police chief Sr. Comr. Bambang Wibowo said the Chinese citizens — identified as Fan Shenghong, Cui Henggo, Hang Yongsheng, Wang Sisen, Han Baolin and Chu Kaishan — were still on board their boat as of Tuesday evening and were under police custody because they did not possess complete travel documents. ""The [Chinese citizens] were previously questioned in the middle of the sea on board an Australian patrol boat for two nights before they finally got released and escorted to Indonesian waters,"" Bambang said on Tuesday. Two Indonesians who accompanied the Chinese on the boat, identified as Aba and Madan — residents of East Flores and South Sulawesi, respectively — were questioned by the Rote Timur Police as they were accused of helping to smuggle the foreigners to neighboring Australia. According to the police, the six Chinese nationals initially attempted to sail to Australia in a wooden boat identified as the KMP Indah. The journey took three nights. After getting intercepted by the Australian authorities, the latter gave the Chinese nationals a new boat and two jerry cans of fuel after confiscating the KMP Indah. However, they ran out of fuel just after arriving in Indonesian waters at about 8:15 a.m. Indonesian Central Time. They proceeded to drop anchor close to the FaiFua salt mine in East Rote district. “They were found by two patrol boats from Polairud [a water and air police unit] and the Rote Navy base, which were patrolling together at that time. They found the Chinese residents when they were inspecting the boat,” Bambang said. The police summoned health officers from Rote Ndao to see if the Chinese residents were infected by coronavirus. “The result was negative,” he added. The police are still coordinating with the Kupang immigration office to see if the Chinese residents could be moved to Kupang. (dpk)  © 2016 - 2022 PT. Bina Media Tenggara","AUS","chinese",0,0,0,0

The post reads: “NOW WATCH THE BIG CHINESE TOURIST INVASION BEGIN. 200 MILLION CHINESE VISA's ALLOCATED FOR AUSTRALIA ALLOWING A 10 YEAR STAY.” Below is a screenshot of the post: The claim is false. Australia's Department of Home Affairs told AFP via email on January 23, 2020 that “there is no such allocation of 200 million visas"". According to the Australian Embassy in Beijing, Chinese citizens can obtain a visa through the “visitor visa (subclass 600) program,” which generally allows only three-month stays. Frequent Chinese visitors to Australian can apply for the program’s Frequent Traveller stream, which grants visas that are valid for 10 years but also limits each entry to a maximum three-month stay. According to the Department of Home Affairs website, the frequent traveller visa is for citizens of the People's Republic of China “who travel often to Australia for business or personal reasons.” Between July 2018 to June 2019, there were 1.43 million Chinese visitors to Australia and is the ""largest source country of short-term visitor arrivals"", according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

In Portugal there has been promised an investment of millions, but nothing has progressed, despite remaining linked to four Portuguese companies. Less than a year ago Macau Business reported a strange investment of Chinese capital in Portugal, which promised millions but went bankrupt a few months later. The company in question – Prospect Time International – is based in Kowloon and announced several investments in Portugal (Alentejo region), reaching 1.8 billion euros (approx. MOP16 billion). The owner of this same company has just been accused of being behind “a Chinese espionage ring” who is trying “to install an agent for Beijing in a seat in Australia’s Federal Parliament”. On the basis of the accusations are revelations made by a Chinese defector, Wang Liqiang, who said to the Camberra authorities he had worked as a spy in Hong Kong and Taiwan. From these revelations, the Australian intelligence services came to the conclusion that “the suspected Chinese intelligence group offered a million dollars to pay for the political campaign of Liberal Party member and Melbourne luxury car dealer Bo ‘Nick’ Zhao, 32, to run for an eastern suburbs seat. The plot appears to be part of an operation to place a Chinese agent in Parliament,” according to a journalistic investigation by Australian media outlets The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes. A few days after the journalistic revelations, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) director-general of security Mike Burgess issued a statement entitled “Foreign interference”, saying ASIO “takes seriously” the allegations reported by the journalists about Mr Zhao. From the deserter’s allegations, ASIO questioned Mr Zhao and he identified the man who, according to him, approached him, Brian Chen. Brian Chen (Chinese name Chen Chunsheng) is the CEO of Prospect Time International, and who met with several mayors of Portugal, where he promised these millions of investment. The investigation of The Age, Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes also reveals that Mr Chen has denied knowing Mr Zhao or being involved in Chinese intelligence activities. “However, sources say Australian authorities have determined that Mr Chen had been in contact with Mr Zhao.” However, last March, Mr Zhao was found dead in a Melbourne motel room. Nobody has said how he died. “There is no suggestion that Mr Chen has any knowledge or involvement in Mr Zhao’s death,” state the journalists. “Where is the investment of the Chinese?” One of the authors of the article was in contact with Macau Business in the weeks before the story was published. He sought to learn more about the caricatural details surrounding Prospect Time International’s entry into Portugal. Despite our willingness to cooperate, unfortunately it was not possible to find out much more: none of the various promised investments advanced, nor did the Hong Kong-based company give signs of life. On the contrary, it erased from its website all references to Portugal, which ranged from several photographs of the investment promises to the office address of the delegation in Portugal. At this time, there is no reference to this investment intent; although Brian Chen remains linked to four small companies based in Portugal. Two of the companies are in the real estate area, one is dedicated to solar energy and the fourth (Prosperscenery – Culture and Travel) presents itself as providing consulting services. Brian Chen is the managing partner of the four and, although he has both Portuguese and Hong Kong partners, he has full control of the companies. “The Age, Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes have confirmed from multiple Western security sources that Mr [Brian] Chen is a suspected senior Chinese intelligence operative” In common is the fact that the four companies have no known activity, either because they were created about a year and a half ago or because their share capital is very small (varies between MOP50,000 and MOP100,000). Still, Macau Business learned that one of the four, Joint Yeld Investments, was incorporated less and moved to Lisbon less than a year ago (this was Brian Chen’s last administrative act in Portugal). The chairman of one of the political parties in the district where he was promised a major investment, Portalegre, asked in June “where is the investment of the Chinese”? A very sensitive and uncomfortable subject “The suspected plot to fund Mr Zhao’s campaign would be the clearest example of Chinese government foreign interference ever detailed in a Western country, and provides some insight into the scale and nature of the threat that ASIO has labelled ‘unprecedented’ but which has never been publicly explained in detail,” stated The Age, Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes. Those media outlets also have “confirmed from multiple Western security sources that Mr Chen is a suspected senior Chinese intelligence operative, a claim Mr Chen has confirmed was put to him by Australian officials at Melbourne airport in March but which he vehemently denies.” There is no indication that Brian Chen’s interests in Portugal could be related to these allegations. On the other hand, the Portuguese secret services do not make public statements, so no comment could be obtained. Still, from the many contacts made by Macau Business to sources linked to the secret services, we understand at least that it can be understood as a very sensitive and uncomfortable subject. “Hong Kong and Chinese corporate records reveal Mr Chen runs several companies involved in the military, public security and energy sectors and his business partners include firms linked to the Chinese government,” state the journalists. Already the investments announced for Portugal between 2017 and 2018 were mainly in real estate and tourism, which contrasts with the areas promoted by Prospect Time on its website. “How Beijing’s spies are infiltrating Hong Kong’s democracy movement” It all started with the revelations that emerged with the defection to Australia of a man claiming to be a Chinese spy. The Age, Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes said that Wang Liqiang, who allegedly was an intelligence operative, “claimed the Chinese government used front companies and influence campaigns to infiltrate Hong Kong’s independence movement, organise kidnappings and assaults on democracy activists and interfered in Taiwan’s elections.” The report also “has given previously unheard details about the kidnapping of five booksellers from Hong Kong and their rendition to the Chinese mainland.” According to the journalists, “his testimony shows how Beijing’s spies are infiltrating Hong Kong’s democracy movement, manipulating Taiwan’s elections and operating with impunity in Australia.” ","AUS","chinese",0,0,0,0

Chinese tourists enjoying the unique scenery are welcomed by Falun Dafa practitioners who offer them information they are not allowed to see in China. Practitioners greet tourists with banners and posters and demonstrate the gentle Falun Dafa exercises. They explain what Falun Dafa is, answer questions, and clarify any misconceptions that the tourists may have due to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda. Many tourists decide to sever their ties with CCP organizations after talking to practitioners. One couple from northeastern China read the information about the self-immolation hoax at Tiananmen Square and asked a practitioner several questions. When they were told that hundreds of millions of Chinese have quit the Party's organizations and asked if they also wished to quit, the husband immediately said, “Of course!” He explained that he had joined the Communist Youth League as a child. The wife smiled and said she hadn't joined any CCP organizations. A young man in his 20s was part of the same tour group. After quietly listening to the conversation and reading the banners, he said that he had joined the Young Pioneers and asked how he could quit. When a practitioner said many people used pseudonyms, the woman from northeastern China suggested a pseudonym for him. He nodded in agreement. Most of the tourists in this group chose to quit the CCP organizations. Chinese tourists stop to read posters and banners containing information not available in China. A minibus stopped at the tourist site one day. Using a megaphone, a young Chinese tour guide pointed out the site's attractions. He also mentioned that they would see Falun Dafa volunteers who could help them quit the CCP organizations with either their real names or pseudonyms. As the tourists finished taking photos, their guide reminded them about quitting the CCP. One young woman who had been reading the posters said she knew the CCP was vicious and wanted to quit. A practitioner helped her quit the Youth League and Young Pioneers. A group of five tourists from Shanghai were influenced by the CCP's propaganda against Falun Dafa and were initially cold to practitioners. One woman demanded, “How much money are you paid to stand here?” A practitioner told her that many practitioners work during the week but volunteer to go there on weekends, adding, “Practitioners have benefited so much from Falun Dafa. I had a few chronic illnesses but I was fine after I began practicing.” She explained that practitioners want to tell people their stories and clear up their misconceptions. The practitioner explained that people in over 100 countries practice Falun Dafa. She also told her how she could overcome the CCP's online censorship and access unfiltered information overseas. The woman's attitude changed, and she said she wanted to learn the exercises, so the practitioner demonstrated the movements. Before they left, all five tourists thanked the practitioners and said they would read the information about Falun Dafa. Besides offering information, practitioners try to help tourists. One tour group and its guide were hostile towards practitioners and refused to interact with them or accept any materials. One couple accepted some water, however, as the public water fountain malfunctioned and could not be turned off. A practitioner came over and said she'd contact the city to repair it. Since the practitioner was not upset by their earlier hostile attitude and instead offered help, the tour guide told the group, “Practitioners are good people who follow the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance.” The practitioner took the opportunity to explain why she was there and that she just wanted to let people know what was really going on in China. The guide and the tourists thanked her. A tour group from Shandong Province stopped to read a poster about the staged self-immolation. A man in his 20s pointed to it and explained to his family, “It seems this was planned ahead of time so it could be filmed.” A practitioner pointed out that the videos were taken from different angles with various focal lengths. The man’s father agreed and said, “Yes, at that time no one had smartphones to take videos. The average person wouldn't be able to film videos like this unless it was arranged ahead of time!” The other tourists all nodded in agreement. They spoke at length with the practitioner about the CCP’s mistreatment of people who hold spiritual beliefs. More tourists joined the discussion. When one person disagreed, another tourist told him, “The CCP has killed tens of millions of people and is rotten to the core.” A Chinese man in his 50s and his daughter in her 20s were enjoying the scenery. Drawn to the practitioners' posters, the man stopped in front of each one and read slowly. After his daughter finished taking her selfies, she came over and asked him to photograph her. “I have to read this,” he replied. “This information is very important.” He asked another tourist to help his daughter take photos. After he finished reading, the man chatted with a practitioner. He said because his family was wealthy, they were targeted during the CCP's political campaigns. As a result, he never joined any CCP organizations. He said he supported practitioners' efforts to help people renounce their memberships in the CCP. When his daughter returned, a practitioner asked if she wanted to renounce her membership in the Youth League and the Young Pioneers. With her father's encouragement and approval, the daughter agreed before they boarded their bus.

However, many people don’t know that there is much more to the Chinese zodiac than that. Chinese astrology is extremely in tune with the natural world and the natural order, which is why there are five elements that also affect your zodiac sign: Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal. The Chinese also believe in the concept of Yin (feminine, passive, dark energy) and Yang (masculine, light, active energy). All of these symbols and energies come together to make you who you are. Were you born on one of the luckiest birth dates of your Chinese zodiac sign? Even if you weren’t, these days will still be among the luckiest for you. The Rat is the Chinese zodiac sign known for being inquisitive, shrewd and resourceful. The Rat is also the first in the rotation of the 12 zodiac signs, meaning that a Rat year is a year of renewal. So when a Rat year comes, it generally delivers new experiences with favourable outcomes for all of the signs. The Metal element aspect also indicates success, as this is the element of production. Metal is strong, determined and resolute. With all of these properties combined, TheChineseZodiac.org suggests that 2020, the year of the Metal Rat, looks to be a year that is filled with growth and accomplishments. Birth years of the Rat: 1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008 Next year of the Rat: 2032 According to TravelChinaGuide.com, the Chinese zodiac is ruthlessly ironic in the fact that the sign whose year it is tends to be the most out of luck. Since 2020 is the year of the Rat, people under this sign may feel like they have a dark cloud hovering over their heads. However, it is important to note that this is largely a matter of perspective. The year of the Metal Rat is filled with opportunities for success for everyone, so don’t let anxiety or negativity ruin it for you. Of course, the Chinese zodiac isn’t the only zodiac. Find out what your astrological star sign reveals about your career. Birth years of the Ox: 1913, 1925, 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009 Next year of the Ox: 2021 Those born under the Ox sign are dependable and strong, but sometimes their steadfastness makes them a bit stubborn. This can pose a problem during a year that is ruled by the Metal element since Metal is also tough and unwavering. Success and luck are still ready and waiting for the Ox in 2020, but people of this Chinese zodiac sign will need to be more flexible in order to attain great things this year. Birth years of the Tiger: 1914, 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010 Next year of the Tiger: 2022 Described by Horoscope.com as powerful, adventurous and passionate, the Tiger should enjoy great fortune in 2020. This year is all about the willingness to take the jump into new, unexplored territories, and the Tiger is ready to pounce. It will be a rock-star year for this sign, as long as they don’t get involved in too many high-risk scenarios and get in over their heads. Birth years of the Rabbit: 1915, 1927, 1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011 Next year of the Rabbit: 2023 The Rabbit is a refined, sensitive and rather reserved zodiac sign. In a year that prizes the ability to put oneself out into the world and engage in new experiences, the Rabbit may end up feeling a bit uncomfortable. The Rabbit’s need for peace and quiet may inhibit them from going out and taking full advantage of this auspicious year. Be willing to take more chances. Find out what your birth order reveals about you. Birth years of the Dragon: 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012 Next year of the Dragon: 2024 Dragons are flashy, wild and charismatic. They love any opportunity to shine, and the year of the Metal Rat gives them ample opportunity. The Dragon will be riding high this year – but therein also lies potential danger. Dragons can easily get carried away, so be sure to maintain a level of self-awareness before things get out of control. Dragons should also beware of their own arrogance. Birth years of the Snake: 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013 Next year of the Snake: 2025 The Snake is a complex character: generous yet cunning, cautious yet sly. The focus of 2020 for the Snake is going to be on relationships, both professional and personal. How you cultivate these relationships will determine how far you get in discovering your true self and what you ultimately want to do in life. Birth years of the Horse: 1918, 1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014 Next year of the Horse: 2026 The Horse will have the opposite problem that the Rabbit will have in 2020. Where the Rabbit will naturally be cautious about the new prospects springing up in the year of the Metal Rat, the Horse will perhaps be too eager. The year of the Rat has positive implications for everyone, but the excitable Horse will need to rein in excessive emotions in order to reap those benefits. Still, the Horse also has an admirable sense of independence, which will prove useful when pursuing new endeavours. Birth years of the Goat: 1919, 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015 Next year of the Goat: 2027 According to ChinaHighlights.com, the Goat (or Sheep) is gentle, passive and family-oriented. With their even temper, those born under this Chinese zodiac sign will be able to sail through 2020 with minimal problems. Don’t let your love of peace and stability stand in the way of change and golden opportunities, though. SUBSCRIBE NOWLATEST ISSUE © 2022 Reader’s Digest Australia .

The Olaroz project in Argentina is a joint venture between Orocobre, Japan’s Toyota Tsusho Corp, and Jujuy Energia y Minera Sociedad del Estado, a mining investment firm owned by the local government. Orocobre said Toyota Tsusho signed one contract for supply of 7,200 tonnes of battery grade lithium carbonate and a second order for 2,880 tonnes of micronised battery grade lithium carbonate. The orders will be delivered over three years with the first shipment expected in the March quarter, the company said in a statement. Last month, Orocobre cut its lithium carbonate sales price for the December quarter to ensure retention of market share, as prices of the metal used in batteries of electric vehicles have plummeted due to lower demand from Chinese customers.

The flight, operated by China Eastern Airlines, will take nine hours. The flight is the first of a trial service between Shanghai and Perth over the Chinese New Year season, WA Tourism Minister Paul Papalia announced in Shanghai during a tourism forum on Monday. The service will operate each Monday, Wednesday and Friday until February 17. ""Ongoing direct flights between Shanghai and Perth would open up a massive new visitor market,"" said Papalia. ""We want this trial service to become a permanent connection between the two cities and we are in ongoing talks."" ""Direct flights from key markets such as China are critical to growing the state's tourism industry,"" he said. Papalia led a delegation to Shanghai in the lead up to the inaugural flight and met with travel agents and tourism officials. Perth will host a massive Chinese New Year Festival, with celebrations and performances, Papalia announced at the forum. Group tour operators are also preparing to receive Chinese visitors who want to get out and explore destinations that are further away from cities, Papalia added.

We also have the Grammys to look forward to this weekend, as the impeachment trial rumbles on. Here's what you need to know: Today, Donald Trump becomes the first president ever to attend the March for Life anti-abortion rally held in Washington D.C. The march occurs each year on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in all 50 states. According to its website, March for Life is the largest annual human rights demonstration in the world, with more than 100,000 attendees. This year's rally comes before the Supreme Court's March 4 hearing of June Medical Services v. Gee, a case with big implications for the future of abortion rights—and the first major abortion case involving Trump's newly-appointed Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Trump will be making a public address at the event. The march begins on Constitution Avenue at 1 p.m. EST. January 25 marks the Chinese New Year, or Lunar New Year. On the first new moon of the lunar calendar, celebrations commence in many Asian countries and around the world. An estimated 1.5 billion people observe the holiday, or more than one-fifth of the world's population. But some festivities in China have been cancelled due to fears of the deadly coronavirus continuing to spread. The World Health Organization has decided for now not to declare the virus a ""global health emergency,"" though they warned that ""it may yet become one."" ""Music's Biggest Night"" is happening on Sunday. The 62nd Grammy Awards will air on CBS at 8pm EST at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Musicians will be recognized in 84 categories, Alicia Keys will host and musical performances will include Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Aerosmith, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, Camila Cabello, H.E.R., the Jonas Brothers and others. Prince will receive a special Grammy tribute concert. These awards come amid a PR nightmare—Deborah Dugan, the first female CEO of the the National Academy of Recording Arts, has been placed on leave after filing a sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit and for questioning the integrity of the Acadamy's voting process. January 26 is for the ""land down under."" Australia Day is the official national holiday for Australians to honor their history and take pride in their country. The holiday commemorates the 1788 arrival of Royal Navy Captain Arthur Phillip, whose 11 prisoner ships landed in Sydney and thus founded Australia as a penal colony for the British. Australia Day 2020 will undoubtedly feel different—and emotional, given the national tragedy of the bushfires that have burned huge swaths of the country and killed at least 25 people and an estimated 1 billion animals. Having taken their full 24 hours in 8 hour increments over three days, and with no witnesses called, the House managers have concluded presenting their case to impeach Donald Trump.

A men’s downhill had been scheduled for February 15 at Yanqing to start a two-race weekend. FIS said in a statement that it would advise later if the downhill and super-G races will be be rescheduled. That followed a decision by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) to postpone Pro League games in China, and qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympics, scheduled in February in football, basketball and boxing, being moved outside China. The Chinese women’s hockey team was due to host Belgium for two games on February 8-9 in Changzhou. Those were postponed on Tuesday by the FIH, citing “current uncertainties around the outbreak of the coronavirus in China”. The governing body said it was “following the recommendations of the World Health Organisation”, ahead of future matches. China is scheduled to host Australia for two games on March 14-15. The biggest upcoming event in China is the Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai on April 19, which draws large crowds for the race and for practice and qualifying. Olympic qualifying events scheduled in China in February to help decide entries for the Tokyo Games have also been affected in recent days. Women’s football and women’s basketball games were moved to Australia and Serbia. The football games had already previously moved from Wuhan, at the centre of the outbreak, to Nanjing. Boxing tournaments for the Asia and Oceania regions will be held in Jordan in March. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike acknowledged her concern about the virus ahead of the Olympics. Games organisers put out a statement on Wednesday, saying: “Counter measures against infectious diseases constitute an important part of our plans to host a safe and secure games,” and officials will “carefully monitor any incidence of infectious diseases and we will review any counter measures that may be necessary with all relevant organisations”.","AUS","chinese",0,0,0,0

(Australian Office Taipei photo) The Australian representative office in Taipei said Tuesday (Jan. 21) that its government's disclosure of a case involving a self-confessed spy from China, who was seeking asylum in Canberra late last year, was not aimed at influencing Taiwan's general elections, as has been alleged. In an exclusive interview with CNA Tuesday, Gary Richard Cowan, head of the Australian Office Taipei, said there was no truth to the allegations that the Australia government or people were seeking to influence Taiwan's election. ""There is no circumstance under which Australia would seek to interfere in an election in Taiwan,"" Cowan said, adding that only the Taiwanese people have the right to choose their leader and decide who should represent them. The case of the self-confessed Chinese spy Wang Liqiang (王立強) was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald and other Australian media outlets last November, during the campaign leading up to Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections on Jan. 11. According to the reports, Wang went to Australia's counter-espionage agency last October with information on how China's intelligence officers had been funding and conducting spying operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. China's law enforcement agencies denied the reports, saying Wang was a fugitive wanted for fraud. In Taiwan, some news commentators said the timing of the reports indicated that the Australian government had fed Wang's story to the media in a bid to help Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) win her second term. Cowan, however, said that was not the case, as the Australian government does not take sides in Taiwan politics. ""Australia has had longstanding and good relations with people across the political spectrum in Taiwan for a long time, and we expect that to continue,"" Cowan said. He congratulated Tsai, her running mate Lai Ching-te (賴清德), and all the legislators-elect on their victory and lauded Taiwan's democratic development since its period of martial law ended in 1987. On the question of future cooperation between Australia and Taiwan, Cowan said the focus will be on education, trade, energy and science. This year, he said, the theme of the bilateral relations is ""discover Taiwan, discover Australia,"" as chosen by his office. Meanwhile, Cowan expressed thanks to the Taiwan government for donating 6,000 respirator masks to Australia, which is battling a series of devastating bushfires, and to the Taiwan Red Cross for launching a donation drive. Cowan urged the Taiwanese people to continue visiting, studying, working and investing in Australia, saying those are the best ways to support the country's recovery. ""The emergency is ending,"" he said. ""We are very much open for business and looking forward to welcoming people there.""

The Australian Patrol boat previously drove the Chinese away from Australian territory into Indonesian waters.  January 30th, 2020 | 10:33 AM | 410 views ROTE ISLAND, EAST NUSA TENGGARA  Six Chinese nationals have been stranded on Rote Island, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), following a failed attempt to reach Australia in a wooden boat.  Before going aground on the island's shore, the boat, which sailed from the coastal province of Jiangsu in China, has reportedly been floating in the waters near Rote Timur district after an Australian patrol vessel drove it away from its territory.  Rote Ndao Police chief Sr. Comr. Bambang Wibowo said the Chinese citizens — identified as Fan Shenghong, Cui Henggo, Hang Yongsheng, Wang Sisen, Han Baolin and Chu Kaishan — were still on board their boat as of Tuesday evening and were under police custody because they did not possess complete travel documents.  ""The [Chinese citizens] were previously questioned in the middle of the sea on board an Australian patrol boat for two nights before they finally got released and escorted to Indonesian waters,"" Bambang said on Tuesday.  Two Indonesians who accompanied the Chinese on the boat, identified as Aba and Madan — residents of East Flores and South Sulawesi, respectively — were questioned by the Rote Timur Police as they were accused of helping to smuggle the foreigners to neighboring Australia.  According to the police, the six Chinese nationals initially attempted to sail to Australia in a wooden boat identified as the KMP Indah. The journey took three nights.  After getting intercepted by the Australian authorities, the latter gave the Chinese nationals a new boat and two jerry cans of fuel after confiscating the KMP Indah.  However, they ran out of fuel just after arriving in Indonesian waters at about 8:15 a.m. Indonesian Central Time. They proceeded to drop anchor close to the FaiFua salt mine in East Rote district.  “They were found by two patrol boats from Polairud [a water and air police unit] and the Rote Navy base, which were patrolling together at that time. They found the Chinese residents when they were inspecting the boat,” Bambang said.  The police summoned health officers from Rote Ndao to see if the Chinese residents were infected by coronavirus.  “The result was negative,” he added.  The police are still coordinating with the Kupang immigration office to see if the Chinese residents could be moved to Kupang.

He admitted to lying to immigration officials by claiming he arrived from Hong Kong, when he in fact flew to Sydney from mainland China. The government brought in emergency measures over the weekend which bar any passenger who has left or passed through mainland China from entering Australia. There are already 12 people in Australia with coronavirus, which has killed 362 worldwide and threatens to become a global pandemic. Daily Mail Australia alerted the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force to the breach, but did they did not respond to requests for comment. The student claimed he flew into Brisbane airport (pictured, other passengers arriving at the coastal airport before the ban) The student, whose name was given as Xiao K, started his journey in China, changing planes in Hong Kong before arriving in Brisbane. Revealing he lied on his yellow incoming passenger card, he bragged that he quickly crossed out 'China' as his place of departure and instead wrote 'Hong Kong'. Worryingly, he boasted that customs officials didn't even check his luggage. 'Fortunately, they were focusing on people. 'In the end, they didn't even check my suitcase.' The student admitted he had no idea about the China ban, but when he found out about it decided to flout the rules and enter Australia illegally (pictured, the first of series of texts) In an incriminating message (pictured) the student says he changed his arrival card to say 'Hong Kong' instead of 'China' as his original place of departure Passengers arriving in Australia are required under Australian law to identify themselves and provide certain information. When you arrive in Australia from a foreign country, you are given a passenger card to fill in. One of the boxes asks for the name of the 'country in which you boarded the flight'. But this Chinese student wrote 'Hong Kong' in this section, despite starting his journey in China. With this, he claims authorities did not question him and simply waved him through. If he had written 'China' in the box, he would have been stopped and questioned. The student claimed he didn't know about the ban when he first boarded a plane in an unknown Chinese airport. He claimed to have thought he would have to go into isolation for 14 days when on Australia soil, but was soon informed about the travel ban by a friend. Before going through immigration in Australian, he then exploited an airport loophole to change his arrival card. 'When I was clearing immigration a customs officer checked my arrival card,' he explained in a series of damning texts seen by Daily Mail Australia. 'Because I’d heard the news about the China entry after landing I’d changed mine to say Hong Kong. 'They looked at me and told me to go through a different channel with my luggage. 'They just let me go through.' He was then asked if he meant the immigration declaration card. The student admitted he was waved through immigration in a series of shocking text messages, which have been translated by Daily Mail Australia China has gone into lockdown after the virus claimed more than 400 lives (pictured, students in Beijing) Australia is one of many countries organising evacuation flights home (pictured, Singaporeans boarding a charter flight) The travel ban measures were announced on the same day Qantas (airline staff pictured on Friday) revealed plans to suspend its direct flights to mainland China He replied: 'Yes. The yellow one. I crossed off ""China"" and changed it to ""Hong Kong"".' Asked how he felt after flagrantly disregarding the rules, which are intended to keep Australians safe, he replied: 'Really lucky!' The Department of Foreign Affairs has raised its travel advice for China to the highest level of 'do not travel'. From February 1, foreign nationals who have left mainland China are not allowed entry into Australia. Visitors flying in from mainland China are being denied entry to Australia. Pictured are passengers at Brisbane Airport on Friday, just hours before the ban came into place Three more cases of coronavirus (pictured) confirmed on Saturday took Australia's tally to 12 The student claims he left China on February 1, just hours after the ban came into place, and arrived into Brisbane at 11.45pm. People arriving from mainland China, not just the Hubei province, are required to self-isolate for 14 days after they leave the country. But for this student, it was only a matter of hours - potentially leaving the public at serious risk of harm if he were to be infected. Permanent residents and their immediate family are still able to enter Australia, as well as airline crews who have been using appropriate personal protective equipment. The beefed up measures came on the same day three more coronavirus cases - one in Melbourne and two in South Australia - were confirmed, taking the national tally to 12. Qantas also announced on Saturday that it was suspending its two direct services to mainland China from February 9 until March 28. 'Our first responsibility is to Australians,' Mr Morrison told reporters on Saturday afternoon. 'As of Saturday, all travellers arriving out of mainland China are being asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they depart the country. 'In addition to that, there'll be advanced screening and reception arrangements put into place at the major airports to facilitate identifying and providing this information and ensuring the appropriate precautions are being put in place,' Mr Morrison said. A man wearing a face mask cycles past the body of a man who collapsed and died on a pavement in Wuhan on January 30 (pictured), the city at the epicentre of the outbreak 'There's a half a million masks that will be provided to those airports to support those who are coming off these flights as well as those who are with those coming from those flights. 'There'll also be thermometers which are provided to those airports and we're working with those airport authorities now to ensure we can put those arrangements in place.' The announcement came just hours after two more victims of the virus were identified in South Australia. A Chinese couple in their 60s from the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, were visiting family in the state. SA Health Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said: 'They have followed all of the procedures and information that they have been asked to through communicable disease control branch. People wearing face masks queue for hours at a cosmetic store on Monday to buy sanitary masks in Hong Kong amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak (pictured) 'They developed symptoms and were tested at a public hospital before self-isolating at home. 'We do not think there have been any contacts with anybody else in the state and they have been in self-isolation for the required time.' A fourth case in Victoria was also confirmed on Saturday. The woman aged is in her 20s, lives in Melbourne and is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. The first Australian citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan have landed on Christmas Island (pictured arriving in WA before transferring to a charter flight for last leg) Two Australians wore face masks as they spoke about their rescue flight out of Wuhan (pictured) Health authorities insisted she was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed tests proved humans caught it the virus from animals at the Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market in Wuhan city. The highly-contagious virus has infected more than 17,000 people worldwide. It has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Footage emerged showing the Australian citizens aboard the Qantas rescue flight (pictured) which left Wuhan on Monday Those aboard the rescue flight from Wuhan were met by army and medics and taken to buses ahead of a 14-day quarantine on Christmas Island (pictured) Australia citizens trapped in Wuhan have now been evacuated and have landed on Christmas Island, where they will enter a quarantine for 14 days. It is understood that 72 people were on board the first of four charter flights expected to take more than 240 evacuees to the Indian Ocean island. The Airbus left Western Australia's RAAF Base Learmonth, near Exmouth, on Monday night, and touched down on Christmas Island about 9pm local time. Those on board were among the 243 who had earlier been evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus, on a Qantas flight.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Saturday that foreign travellers who have left or passed through mainland China will be barred from Australia in a desperate effort to prevent the outbreak from spreading further. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families will be exempt from the strict measures. It also extends to airline staff who have used personal protective gear.

Australians are advised not to travel to mainland China after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the nation grew to 12 on Saturday. South Australia confirmed two cases of the potentially fatal coronavirus on Satruday, taking the national total to 12. A Chinese couple in their 60s from the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, were visiting family in South Australia. SA Health Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier on Saturday confirmed that the two new cases have been admitted to hospital. 'These cases were people that have come from Wuhan, China. They are visiting relatives in South Australia,' she said. 'They have followed all of the procedures and information that they have been asked to through communicable disease control branch.' They developed symptoms and were tested at a public hospital before self-isolating at home. Their relative has been tested, with results pending. 'We do not think there have been any contacts with anybody else in the state and they have been in self-isolation for the required time,' she said. The couple is understood to have left Wuhan on January 20. It comes after 25 people have been tested in South Australia with 15 of those tests coming back negative earlier on Saturday. The measures were announced on the same day Qantas (airline staff pictured on Friday) revealed plans to suspend its direct flights to mainland China Three more cases of coronavirus (pictured) on Saturday have taken Australia's tally to 12 NEW SOUTH WALES: 4 Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman. January 25 January 27 VICTORIA: 4 January 25 January 29 January 30 She is being treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital. February 1 A Melbourne woman aged in her 20s is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. She was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. QUEENSLAND: 2 January 29 January 30 SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 2 February 1 A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital. The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia. SA Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test. Australia has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no need for current concern. 'Some very strong measures have been put in place regarding travel to and from China. We will be working hand in glove with the federal government on this issue,' Premier Steve Marshall said. 'We will be doing everything we can to make sure that they (South Australians) remain safe and we take every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus.' A fourth case in Victoria was also confirmed on Saturday. The woman aged is in her 20s, lives in Melbourne and is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. Health authorities insisted she was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. There are four cases in New South Wales, and two more in Queensland. 'It is a very difficult time. There is absolutely no question about,' foreign minister Marise Payne told reporters. 'A very difficult time for China, for its citizens, for Australians who are currently in China will have family in China, and indeed for the international community. 'It is a significant period of disruption and we are very conscious about and endeavouring to work as constructively as we can.' It came on the same day national airline carrier Qantas suspended flights to China, where the death toll has climbed past 250. Its two direct services to mainland China - Sydney to Beijing and Sydney to Shanghai will be suspended from Sunday February 9 until March 29. 'This follows entry restrictions imposed by countries including Singapore and the United States, which impact the movement of crew who work across the Qantas International network,' a Qantas statement read. 'These entry restrictions pose significant logistical challenges for rostering crew to operate mainland China services, leading to the need to temporarily suspend these flights. There is no change to Qantas services to Hong Kong, which is exempt from current travel restrictions. Qantas warned it may bring forward the planned suspension if demand levels or other factors change. 'The date for flights to resume will also be regularly reviewed based on the circumstances,' the statement added. Suspending flights arriving from China was not part of the advice provided by health chiefs, Mr Morrison added. Meanwhile, government officials are expecting the Chinese government to approve a plan to evacuate Australians in Wuhan using a Qantas plane 'very soon', Minister Payne said. 'I would like to register my thanks to the Chinese authorities for their cooperation on this operation in exceedingly difficult circumstances,' she added. Some individuals confirmed to have been infected with novel coronavirus have since been discharged from medical facilities, Mr Morrison said. He had stood behind a decision to send Australian citizens to a detention facility on Christmas Island as an appropriate quarantine measure. The prime minister said he had been in regular contact with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden, and is seeking to ensure border arrangements between the neighbouring countries are aligned. The federal government measure comes after Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called for incoming flights to be halted until the virus is contained. 'I don't often agree with Donald Trump, but I do agree with the US authorities on this occasion that I think we should take every measure possible to combat this virus,' she said. But Mr Morrison said the current advice from medical experts was not to move to 'that level of action'. 'This provides (Australians in mainland China) with the opportunity to return to Australia,' he said. Half a million face masks will be provided to major airports under the government measures 'Our first responsibility is to Australians,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured) announced What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.

A 37-year-old Chinese woman travelling in Queensland has been confirmed as infected with the deadly virus. The woman was travelling with the same tour group as the previously confirmed cases and is currently isolated in a stable condition at Gold Coast Hospital. All nine members of the tour group are in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital after they arrived to the city on Tigerair flight TT566 from Melbourne on January 27. A fifth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Queensland. A computer artwork of the virus is pictured A 44-year-old man, a 42-year-old woman, a 37-year-old man and an eight-year-old boy from the group have also contracted the illness. It's the state's fifth confirmed case of the virus, while there are four each in NSW and Victoria, and two cases in South Australia Of those, three people have recovered and been released. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in mainland China. Two Australians on a cruise ship off Japan also contracted coronavirus after being exposed by a previous passenger. The pair were among 10 people including three each from Japan and Hong Kong, one from the US and one Filipino crew member who tested positive aboard the Diamond Princess. Two Australians on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan also contracted coronavirus after being exposed by a previous passenger More than 100 Australians have been evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Seventy-two people, including infants, were flown on a Qantas flight to Western Australia on Monday before they were taken to Christmas Island. Another 35 Australians joined an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland before they were transferred to another flight to join the others. The group will be held on Christmas Island for 14 days, provided they aren't diagnosed with the illness. Dr Jeanette Young, the state's Chief Health Officer, on Tuesday urged anyone who has returned from mainland China in the past 14 weeks and who feels unwell to seek medical help immediately. 'This is for the safety of those individuals,' she said. 'It's a very early stage of the development of this outbreak, so we don't fully understand what it means to people, so we really want to test people very early.' She said she was concerned federal government officials hadn't handed over all of its data relating to passengers who had flown from mainland China. More than 400 people have been assessed for coronavirus since screening started at Brisbane International Airport on Sunday. Meanwhile, a Sunshine Coast doctor is leading a team of medical experts treating hundreds of Australians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan to Christmas Island on Monday. Doctor Daniel Holmes is steering the team providing treatment while the group sits out 14 days of quarantine. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has begged the federal government to activate natural disaster relief funding in response to the outbreak. She says the tourism industry is being bled dry by travel bans with the Cairns region alone losing $200million in forward bookings, and exporters including seafood producers who service China losing their entire markets. Meanwhile, businesses in suburbs such as Eastwood and Chatswood in Sydney fear they will go under due to lack of sales. More to come.

The Morrison government's decision to extend the travel ban by an extra week is an “overreaction”, according to the embassy. ""We express our deep regret and dissatisfaction over the Australian government's announcement,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""Only Australia and a small number of countries have taken such extreme measures which are an overreaction indeed."" From Friday, foreign nationals who have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left. However the embassy says the ban should be scrapped as the World Health Organisation hasn’t yet recommended travel restrictions from China. The US and New Zealand have made similar bans to Australia to help contain the virus. 'Disgusting' trend spiralling 'out of control' amid coronavirus outbreak Fears over coronavirus 'super spreader' – but what does it mean? Parents' regret after Aussie toddler ends up stranded in coronavirus epicentre Labor leader Anthony Albanese stood by the federal government over the decision, saying the safety of Australians was paramount. “We need to defend our national interest in the safety of Australian citizens,” he said on Friday. Some Chinese nationals living in Australia, particularly students, are resorting to travelling to other countries for a quarantine period of two weeks before heading on to Australia, circumnavigating the ban. Experts believe the education system could take an $8 billion hit as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The University of Canberra has asked its Chinese students to defer their studies due to ""complications from the Chinese firewall"" in accessing study materials online. Businesses have also been hit hard with the lack of Chinese tourists flooding into Australia. The Australian banking industry is offering deferred loan payments, waiving fees and restructuring loans to small business impacted by the effects of the virus – coming on top of a summer of drought, bushfires and floods. ""Banks have hardship teams in place to walk businesses through the assistance on offer if they have been impacted by events outside of their control,"" Australian Banking Association CEO Anna Bligh said in a statement. There are now more than 60,000 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the province of Hubei where it was first detected, and 1357 people have died. Of the 15 cases in Australia, six have been cleared and the remaining nine are all stable. No quarantined Australians at Christmas Island and Darwin have tested positive for the virus, with the first group of evacuees due to return home on Monday. With AAP Do you have a story tip?

The guilty country is not named, but obviously is China: Australia’s national intelligence agency has broken up a large foreign spy ring but faces an unprecedented level of espionage directed from overseas, its director-general has revealed. Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), said it had stopped a “sleeper” agent running a spy ring that provided logistical and financial support for foreign agents engaged in intelligence-gathering and the harassment of dissidents. “The level of threat we face from foreign espionage and interference activities is unprecedented,” Mr Burgess said. “It is higher now than it was at the height of the Cold War.” This is rather chilling: Mr Burgess said: “We’ve seen visiting scientists and academics ingratiating themselves into university life with the aim of conducting clandestine intelligence collection.” That certainly has happened here, too. “ASIO has uncovered cases where foreign spies have travelled to Australia with the intention of setting up sophisticated hacking infrastructure targeting computers containing sensitive and classified information,” Mr Burgess said. “And perhaps most disturbingly, hostile intelligence services have directly threatened and intimidated Australians in this country.” He said that the case of the sleeper agent unmasked by his agency read like a “Cold War thriller”. “The agent lay dormant for many years, quietly building community and business links, all the while secretly maintaining contact with his offshore handlers,” Mr Burgess said. “The agent started feeding his spymasters information about Australia-based expatriate dissidents, which directly led to harassment of the dissidents in Australia and their relatives overseas. Whatever the Chinese have done to infiltrate and spy on Australia, we can be sure they have done orders of magnitude more to infiltrate and spy on the U.S. Chinese influence on American universities, which has been bought and paid for, is particularly alarming. Given what we now know about the conduct of China’s Communist regime, it is hard to understand the deference that the American government paid to the Chinese prior to the Trump administration.

Mother Xing Lan Ren, who lives in China, wanted to see her 22-year-old son Xiao Li in Melbourne before he passed away but her visa was not approved in time After the crash, Ms Ren payed $1,415 to fast track her visa application, which normally takes two working days. However, three days later Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a two-week ban on foreign arrivals from mainland China in order to stop the spread of coronavirus. Mrs Ren was shocked by the news and told a local Chinese-language publication that she just wanted to say goodbye to her only son. 'My family is completely in the dark, and now I just want to see the [son] for the last time, but Australia has issued a travel ban,' she told Sydney Today. 'I really don't know what to do.' Family friend Simon Lee started a Change.org petition pleading for Ms Ren and her brother Shi Luming to be allowed into the country. The petition was directed at Federal MP Gladys Liu and garnered almost 3,000 signatures. 'We pledge that the temporary visa of Mrs Ren and Mr Shi to be granted so they can visit Mr Li (son of Mrs Ren and nephew of Mr Shi) in the Intensive Care Unit of Royal Melbourne Hospital; and Mrs Ren and Mr Shi to be allowed enter to Australia despite the travel restrictions,' it read.

Chinese tourists in Australia are scrambling to extend their visas to avoid heading home where coronavirus has killed around 563 people Legal experts say Chinese visitors will have a good case to extend their visas if travel restrictions due to the coronavirus outbreak make their journeys home difficult. Jennifer Zhu, a Sydney migration lawyer, said she has been working overtime to deal with a high volume of applications. 'A lot of them are very urgent due to the remaining days on their visas,' she told the ABC. 'Some of them might only have a few more days before they must leave and they need professional advice instantly.'

The company the move to save money because not enough customers were booking flights as coronavirus spreads around the world. The airline decided to axe some international routes and cut 750 jobs after it lost $350million in 2019. In November it announced its service from Melbourne to Hong Kong will stop on 11 February - and it also slashed several domestic routes. Patients infected by the coronavirus rest at a makeshift hospital at Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan City Virgin Australia Group Chief Commercial Officer John MacLeod said the spread of the coronavirus and recent protests played a part in the decision to also cancel the Sydney route. He said in a statement: 'Hong Kong has continued to be a challenging market. 'With a decline in demand following ongoing civil unrest, and growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in the wider region, we have made the decision to withdraw services. 'While the decision to withdraw from the Hong Kong market has been a difficult one, it demonstrates our strong focus on driving greater financial discipline through our network. 'Current circumstances demonstrate that Hong Kong is no longer a commercially viable route for Virgin Australia to continue operating, however international tourism remains an important part of our strategy through our other international routes and partner airlines.' Last month several airlines cancelled flights in and out of China as the coronavirus spread from Wuhan - but only Virgin has cancelled flights to Hong Kong. DFAT's advice for Australians travelling to Hong Kong is to 'exercise a high degree of caution'. All passengers entering or connecting in the city will have their temperatures checked and will not be allowed to board if they have a fever.

The Matildas were dominant from the start, with the midfield in particular showing their class in unlocking the visitors defensive-minded formation. Foord struck first in the 10th minute, calmly sliding the ball past the Taipei keeper when she was played into the box by Kyah Simon. The second goal was much the same, experienced Matildas midfielder Emily van Egmond threading the ball through delightfully with a no-look pass from the edge of the box. Foord danced around the keeper and poked home from six yards. Left back Steph Catley scored just her third international goal just after the half-hour mark, her aggressive darting run behind the backline rewarded by a pinpoint Van Egmond pass. Catley only just managed to beat the Chinese Taipei keeper to the ball and proceeded to chip neatly into the back of the net.

Her first touch set up Foord for yet another relatively simple finish. Van Egmond was substituted at half-time, while Kerr arrived off the bench in the 61st minute. By that stage, Hayley Raso had made it 5-0 with a zippy counter-attack. As four Matildas charged towards goal - facing just one defender and the keeper - Raso stepped around the keeper calmly and banged home. Kerr scored just three minutes after arriving off the bench in the 61st minute, the Matildas continuing to create a host of chances - and Kerr was never going to miss from close range. The chances kept flowing but the clinical finishing faded, at least until Katrina Gorry volleyed home from eight yards after the keeper deflected a cross in her direction.  Australia coach Ante Milicic was proud of his team’s ruthlessness in spite of Taiwan’s defensive intent. “They went away from their usual set-up. With a 5-4-1 block, it’s easy to get frustrated,” Milicic said post-game. “I was pleased that we went in at halftime with a good lead, but at the same time we didn’t stop. Second half we wanted to build on that, and we did. “So overall, very pleased.” The Matildas now move top of Group A in the Asian qualifying region, needing to finish in the top two of the four-team group to earn an Olympics play-off. China won their opening match against Thailand 6-1 earlier on Friday, setting up a blockbuster and potentially decisive final match next Thursday.","none","none",0,0,0,0

The sedan has received a significant update to match the brand’s current range. With the launch of the HS mid-size SUV, MG is left only without a mid-size hatch/sedan combination or dual-cab ute to be a challenging force in all of Australia’s highest-selling segments. While the brand has ruled out its Extender ute for our market for the time being, it is also turning its focus to electric cars. It is understood that the electric version of the MG ZS small SUV will be Australia’s cheapest electric vehicle when it launches later this year, with a starting price of $46,990, undercutting the next-cheapest Nissan Leaf ($49,490). The MG6 was finally discontinued from the Australian market in 2019 after a selling slowly since its introduction alongside MG’s 2016 relaunch. MG does not currently offer the MG6 in any right-hand-drive markets. Since then, the sedan has received a significant update to match the brand’s current range in its newfound home market of China. It is sold there with the same 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine (119kW/250Nm) found in the HS, or as an eMG6 plug-in hybrid. The plug-in hybrid variant employs a 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine and an electric motor for a claimed combined power output of 170kW. MG does not currently offer the MG6 in any right-hand-drive markets, including the UK or Thailand. The Volkswagen Amarok has an official unveil date, with US reports pointing to...

"62",259,"https://thepienews.com/news/regulations-relaxed-in-australia-as-new-taskforce-focuses-on-coronavirus/","Online study a solution for Chinese students grounded en route to Australia","Standard operational procedures for education providers in Australia are being relaxed so that discrepancies in attendance and facilitating online study can be accommodated, as the education sector pivots to cope with temporary travel restrictions from China. 50% of full-fee paying high school students in Australia are from China, with a new school year just beginning “Where providers determine that enrolment in a wholly online or distance learning mode of study is in the student’s best interest for semester 1 or trimester 1 2020, TEQSA will not pursue regulatory action,” announced industry regulator TEQSA. “ASQA acknowledge the challenges providers’ face,” reiterated Saxon Rice, chief commissioner at ASQA, which regulates VET and English language providers. “Providers may wish to consider extending online or distance components of courses for impacted overseas students during the first half of 2020 or implement similar measures.” Meanwhile, IEAA’s Phil Honeywood, the chair of a new Global Reputation Taskforce, has warned of a AUS$8 billion dollar risk as the travel ban impacts many of the 200,000 Chinese students typically hosted annually in the country. “Most of the new and continuing students have been caught off guard because many were brought home to celebrate Chinese new year,” he said. Swift & supportive action from @TEQSAGov to ensure #intlstudents can continue studies. Also shows the resources and talent our institutions have in #digital & #online to respond so quickly 👍🙏. For students- https://t.co/iIZQZEcIH6 aggregates all agency’s info in one place📱 https://t.co/c4pJDBK0WJ — Austrade_Education (@Austrade_Ed) February 1, 2020  While educators rally to work out how to deliver an education to Chinese students unable to get to Australia, Honeywood went on national TV to explain some of the many difficult dimensions to the situation. He underlined that 50% of full-fee paying high school students in Australia are from China, with a new school year just beginning. “We’ve got a massive impact across the whole range of the education sector,” he said. Some Chinese students have pets left in boarding kennels and are unable to return He also described accommodation operators getting in touch to alert him that some Chinese students, two years into a three year degree, have pets left in boarding kennels and are unable to return to Australia because of the travel ban. Honeywood also acknowledged there could be a challenge in “the extent to which the government of China is willing to facilitate online learning and video-based teaching by Australian schools and universities into China”. The Australian government announced a travel ban on February 1 for two weeks, for Chinese nationals entering the country, barring Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family. Those able to enter are also being advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. An international student at UNSW was confirmed as being one of the 12 (at the time of publication) travellers having tested positive for coronavirus in Australia. The country’s largest university, Monash University in Melbourne, has delayed the start of classes on campus, while the University of Sydney is offering affected students additional time to enrol or defer. English Australia is holding a webinar with Austrade on Wednesday February 12 to focus on specific actions being undertaken to support English language students. IEAA and Austrade are also hosting a webinar for all stakeholders on Monday February 10. Meanwhile, social media was reporting that the overnight nature of the travel restrictions had created difficult scenes of Chinese students landing in Australia only to be told they had to return immediately. Universities Australia confirmed it held a meeting on February 3 with education minister Dan Tehan “to identify further measures to minimise disruption caused by new travel restrictions imposed on February 1″. “That offer of ‘maximum flexibility’ from government is so important,” said UA chair, professor Deborah Terry. “We appreciate the commitment to work closely together through the challenges this situation presents. Professor Terry said Australian universities and the government were “as one” in sending a strong message of support to our students in China. “To our students still in China – our care, concern and empathy are with you,” she said, underlining that the UA board will meet the minister again next week. Extolling support to Chinese students also onshore, Terry noted, “You are crucial members of our close-knit university communities – and we will meet this challenge together.” “We will meet this challenge together” Minister Tehan announced the formation of a Global Reputation Taskforce following a meeting of international education stakeholders on January 21 about the impacts the bushfire crisis has had. A participant of the Taskforce, the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia, has said the impact of the coronavirus on the independent tertiary education sector is currently being assessed in order to develop strategies to support both students and providers. Australia’s independent tertiary education sector enjoys a strong international reputation, with independent providers supporting around 90% of all international students undertaking vocational education and training. Government data for February 2020 suggests that the vocational education and training sector was set to support some 13,604 students that were residents of China. Of these some 10,935 are already in Australia with a further 2,669 holding a student travel visa still outside the country, ITECA noted. “As new challenges arise, we’ll collaborate with the Australian government” “Our interest is in supporting these students through the current difficulties and ensuring that when current travel restrictions are lifted, the students are able to undertake their studies in Australia and access the quality outcomes that independent providers offer,” said Troy Williams, ITECA chief executive, in a statement on February 5. “As new challenges arise, we’ll collaborate with the Australian government on developing an appropriate response.” International education is the country’s fourth-biggest export industry and around 29% of all international students in Australian universities are from China, a number that is growing at around 10% per year.

"66",269,"http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/2/27/183417.html","Media Exposes Chinese Consulate's Attempts to Stop Falun Gong Activities in Western Australia","(Minghui.org) The Chinese Consulate in Western Australia has contacted the City of Perth on many occasions, attempting to persuade officials to stop the city from issuing permits to Falun Gong practitioners for their activities and demonstrations. According to a report by Nathan Hondros published by digital media WAtoday on February 11, 2020, the Chinese Consulate frequently contacts the city's executive management team to complain about Falun Gong practitioners' protests, but officials have always rejected these requests. The City of Perth's community development general manager Anne Banks-McAllister told Mr. Hondros that the City of Perth has noted the Consulate's concerns, but continues to issue permits for Falun Gong practitioners' activities because they have always complied with the law.  Falun Gong practitioners in Western Australia hold activities to raise awareness of the ongoing persecution in China in the capital city's central business district on July 19 and 20, 2019. Falun Gong practitioners in Western Australia regularly hold activities throughout the city's Central Business District and near the Chinese consulate office to raise awareness of the Chinese Communist Party's torture and illegal detention of practitioners because of their belief. In 2018, the Chinese Consulate's attempt to have Falun Gong barred from participating in the Perth Christmas parade was exposed by Australian media. Falun Gong had participated in the parade every year since 2008. Albert Lin, representative of the Western Australia Falun Dafa Association, said the CCP had tried to stop their peaceful protests on countless occasions. “The City of Perth has done the right thing,” he said. Mr. Lin said that practitioners were often harassed or threatened in Perth. “Suspicious people would cause trouble at our information booths in the city. They shout at you and you cannot reason with them. For instance, at an event held in the city last year, a man yelled at us. Three passersby asked him to stop, but he refused. They called the police and he quickly left,” Mr. Lin said. In recent years, countless reports have been published in Australian media about the CCP's infiltration and these reports have drawn the attention of elected officials, as well as ordinary Australians. Mr. Lin told Minghui that a Federal Member in Western Australia once told him a story which provides insight into the Communist regime's attempts to influence Australian politics. “A Federal Member won an election several years ago. When he was in office, he kept refusing practitioner's requests for a meeting. When I met this politician a few years later, he told me he had received a letter from the Chinese ambassador to Australia after winning the election warning him not to see Falun Gong practitioners. He was shocked and angry at the audacity of the ambassador. But he chose to heed the warning over the years as it was in his interest to do so,” Mr. Lin said. The CCP tries to influence Australian society through bribing politicians, making contributions to influence policy making, controlling student organizations and Chinese media in Australia, and setting up organizations such as the Confucius Institute and so on. In a piece he wrote for China in Perspective in August 2016, Chen Yonglin, a former consular officer who defected to Australia in 2005, warned that the Australian Government has caused Australia to gradually become China's backyard. “The Communist Party of China had begun a structured effort to infiltrate Australia in a systematic way,” Mr. Chen wrote. Former Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) boss Duncan Lewis, in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald published in November 2019, said that any person was a political target. As well as targeting politicians, Chinese authorities were working to win influence over social, business and media circles, so as to place themselves in an advantageous position. Mr. Lewis was ASIO's director-general of security for five years. ASIO is an intelligence agency and its primary role is to guard against foreign interference. He said without inhibition in the interview, “Covert foreign intrusion from China into the heart of Australian politics is overwhelming” and was “something we need to be very, very careful about.” He also told the Sydney Morning Herald, “The Chinese-Australian community could and should be as vital in the work against foreign covert influence.” Chinese version available Category: Persecution Outside China “Falun Gong Presented at Health Expo in Odense, Denmark” “Save Sentient Beings with Compassion in the Face of Coronavirus Epidemic” ","AUS","chinese",1,1,0,0

The result shows the effects of myriad challenges on a company that has sought to reinvent itself as a relatively simple domestic business after a mass arrest in China in 2016 prompted it to tear up its global expansion plans. “Normalised” net profit, which removes variance in win rates, fell 11% to A$172.7 million ($115.62 million) for the six months ending Dec. 31, the company said, as turnover from high rollers on gambling trips, known as “VIPs” and largely Chinese, tumbled more than a third. The company was “impacted by continued soft market conditions and exacerbated by the recent negative publicity,” new Chief Executive Ken Barton said on an analyst call. Crown, which is 37% owned by billionaire James Packer, was rocked late last year by media reports linking it to money-laundering, local gambling law breaches and Chinese tour operators with connections to organized crime. The reports, which Crown took out full-page newspaper advertisements to deny at the time, prompted several regulatory probes in Australia. The company has since installed a new CEO, Barton, and a new chairman. Crown said on Wednesday it was now experiencing a new challenge: travel restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus epidemic originating in China and “community uncertainty” were keeping gamblers away from its tables. “People would be cautious about going into crowded places at the moment,” Barton said on the call. A quiet period for its gambling tables adds to Crown's woes stemming from the coronavirus. This month, Hong Kong's Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd MLCO.O scrapped a plan to buy a 9.99% stake in the company from Packer, citing temporary casino closures and a plunge in travelers in its home market. Crown shares were down 1% by mid-session on Wednesday, and are down 3% so far this year. “Crown’s first-half 2020 results highlight a weak operating performance,” said credit-ratings firm Moody’s in a client note. “We expect the coronavirus will have a moderate impact on full-year 2020 earnings, with the company having reported softer trading conditions following the travel restrictions as well as general uncertainty around the virus,” Moody’s said. Crown declared an interim dividend of 30 Australian cents per share, unchanged from the same period a year earlier.

Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China. Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak - to apply to return. The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who are successful will be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said. ""It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. ""It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step."" Mr Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students. Chinese students made up almost 40 per cent of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data. That broader population has grown by more than 10 per cent over each of the past three years, contributing more than A$30 billion (S$27.8 billion) to the domestic economy. Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within two weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country. Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempted from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb 29.

""Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,"" the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

Updated: Home Affairs refutes the claims, however.    window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); As The Australian reports, an error in the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) system, which is used to verify visas for overseas residents seeking to enter Australia, has left at least 100 Chinese students unable to board planes and fly back to Australia to commence or recommence their studies. The error is reported as existing because the system hasn’t properly registered those students as being eligible for visas, even after passing the recommended 14-day isolation period around fears of spreading the COVID-19 Coronavirus. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); It’s the latest in a long series of indignities heaped on Chinese students affected since the travel ban on Chinese nationals came into effect on 1 February 2019. The error in the VEVO system appears to have affected students who should otherwise have been granted visas on February 15, because that’s 14 days since the travel ban was enacted, allowing those students the requested time to ensure that they’re not likely to be carriers of the virus. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); The Australian quotes an unnamed student left in travel limbo as being sent an email that simply stated: “Unfortunately, at this time VEVO will continue to be unavailable. However, we encourage you to recheck VEVO when the travel restrictions are lifted.” Gizmodo Australia has contacted the Department of Home Affairs and received the following direct response from a department spokesperson, challenging the Australian’s story: VEVO is a system used by visa holders and third parties such as employers, to check an individual’s visa conditions, particularly in relation to work or study rights. “¢ VEVO is not the system airlines use to check a traveller’s visa. Airlines use the Advance Passenger Processing (APP) system to check that a traveller has both authority to travel to Australia and the appropriate travel documents. “¢ All visa holders can access their visa details, including their grant letter and visa conditions, online via their personal ImmiAccount. “¢ The Department is providing advice directly to visa holders impacted by the travel ban via their ImmiAccounts. Advice is also available on the Department’s website and through the global call centre. “¢ Travellers, including students, are still able to travel to Australia, provided they have not left or transited through mainland China in the last 14 days. “¢ Claims that Chinese students are being penalised or targeted by the current travel restrictions are incorrect. “¢ The restrictions are in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus to Australia. They apply equally to anyone, of any nationality, who has left or transited through mainland China in the last 14 days (unless exempted, such as Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members). International students, including those from China contribute significantly to the Australian economy; in 2018 according to ABS statistics there were 690,000 international students in Australia, adding $34 billion to the economy that year. Continued issues and tensions around COVID-19 could significantly impact that kind of economic stimulus.

Despite this, we all have to respect the Australian government’s travel restrictions.” Among the 12 Chinese entries listed on the world cup’s website are four-times world champion Zhang Chenglong, who claimed the men’s team gold at the 2012 London Olympics and bronze at the Rio Games.

The program was suspended in early February after an outbreak at the Melbourne Airport Holiday Inn, but resumed on Thursday as the state re-opened borders to returning overseas Australians. On Saturday morning, the Victorian Health Department said they had reported one new case overnight. ‘Yesterday there was one new case reported. The case was acquired overseas and is in hotel quarantine,’ the department tweeted on Saturday.  Victoria has reported its first positive coronavirus test since the state resumed its hotel quarantine system  The state had a five-day lockdown in February after an outbreak at the Holiday Inn The new case is the first in Victoria since March 29 and there has been no community transmissions in 42 days. The state has been the hardest hit by the pandemic, registering 20,484 of the country’s 29,390 total cases and 820 of its 909 deaths. Victorians were locked down for 112 consecutive days in the second half of 2020 after a mass outbreak brought the Melbourne to its knees. They faced another five-day lockdown in February following the Holiday Inn leak.  The new case is the first Victoria has seen since March 29 and have had no community transmissions in 42 days Covid-19 Victoria Commissioner Emma Cassar said the new system is ‘as safe as can be’ but admitted it would be reviewed on a daily basis to ensure there was not a repeat scenario. ‘We have done everything we can to make this as safe as we can, and will continue to ensure that the program keeps ahead of this virus,’ Ms Cassar said on Wednesday. ‘It isn’t a risk-proof program, we’ve been clear on that, but what we can do is ensure that we are… looking at the research and looking at what else we can do or other control measures that we need to put in place.’ More than 100 travellers landed in Melbourne on Thursday, with police saying they had inspected every room to ensure it was secure.

Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China. Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak - to apply to return. The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who were successful would be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said. ""It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. ""It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step."" Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students. Chinese students made up almost 40% of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data. That broader population has grown by more than 10% over each of the past three years, contributing more than A$30 billion (£15 billion) to the domestic economy. Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within two weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country. Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempted from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb. 29.

The team is understood to have arrived in Brisbane last week, but had to be quarantined having trained in Wuhan prior the trip.  Whereas none of the team members has exhibited signs and symptoms of the deadly disease, they remain confined in their secured hotel. The team is in Australia as part of the qualifying competition for the Olympic summer Games in Tokyo in the summer. SunSport reports the event was slated to take place in Wuhan which is the origin city of the virus before having it moved to Nanjing, the capital of China's eastern province of Jiangsu.  However, with increasing fears over the spread of the pandemic across China, the country's Football Association relinquished hosting rights altogether, moving the event to Sidney instead. The Chinese team is scheduled to play three matches in the qualifiers, which include fixtures against Thailand, Chinese Taipei and Australia. But they will have to do that without their star player in Wang Shuang who is said to be stuck in Wuhan after returning to play for her hometown club, Wuhan Chedu Jiangda.

AS we at CAAN read this article, it failed to challenge some of the statements being attributed to Irvine. Whilst not wanting to appear ageist, it is a concern a person of his skill and background is chair of the FIRB at this point in his life. -Is he in a position where the past represents more in his thinking than what is happening right now? -Has the CIC been set up to ‘assist’ him overcoming some difficulties in understanding what a lot of Australians are concerned about? -How well equipped is the FIRB to deal with the complexities of foreign organisations? -Is the devil in the detail? Bloomberg’s Michael Heath says we ‘(Australia) should be more relaxed about Chinese cash’ . Well, perhaps that is the very reason why we should be concerned: .how do we know where this cash came from?.how was it gained.is it supposedly privately sourced, or is it derived from State involvement? (In Australia some individuals and companies have already been identified, and are in the public record, at best, probable China-State connected operatives) EXAMPLES: -Greenland, China-backed developer of Lachlan’s Line gated estate North Ryde Precinct -John Holland, now owned by Chinese state-owned engineering and construction behemoth CCCC International Holding is set to diversify into residential development and hotel investments -ASX-listed Boyuan Holdings the Chinese developer with a commercial in confidence proposal for the Badgery’s Creek land currently before the Greater Sydney Commission -Pilot shortage: Chinese-owned airport in Australia looks to increase its flights by 1000%; Kempsey one of three pilot training schools used to train Chinese pilots .do we have reciprocal access to China (heaven forbid why would you seek a slice of one of the most polluted places on earth) or even to their markets? The answer is clearly , no. .’snapping up everything from real estate to infrastructure’ there it is, if any Australians were ever in doubt about what’s happening they should no longer wonder about our fait, the race is on to swallow up as much as possible -Unlike the message we are getting in this article that our relationship needs to be managed and a balance struck between two very different countries and cultures, most Australians are indeed very concerned about being consumed by ‘our biggest trading partner’ A very modest review of Australia’s circumstance would most likely reveal concerns re: -What about the vertical integration of Chinese business activities in Australia? -Why aren’t the Chinese ‘companies’ investing in their own country? -The TITLE DEEDS of our domestic housing being exported at frightening rate and even more alarming the purchasing of rural/mining/construction entities -The lack of credible proof there is a real separation between State and private actors in the acquisition of assets in Australia -The real extent of PROXY buying and visa manipulation, something that is probably beyond our current capacity given the preoccupation the Federal government has had with efficiency dividends for the past five (5) years; slashing departmental budgets and their remits -Despite assurances to the contrary Australia is vulnerable to the subtle and overt coercion that has given rise to loss of SOVEREIGNTY from Australia’s ports to all manner of assets with less than a whisper … it has been effective. Our openness and sensitivity to any blowback has allowed this to happen, as detailed by Clive Hamilton Finally, it is an observation that as it is our misfortune to have inadequate regulations in place that protect our NATIONAL INTERESTS over private gain it is seen at the very least to be our fault, and so is an invitation to foreign entities and individuals to exploit such opportunities!

But their growing presence simply reflects China’s burgeoning power, and Australia needs such capital for its economic development, said Foreign Investment Review Board chief David Irvine. “Having a largest economic partner who is not a traditional ally, that’s I think one of the big challenges of Australian foreign policy,” Irvine said in an interview. “It’s a fact of life. We will adapt to it.” Australia is struggling to strike a balance between security and prosperity. The former is underpinned by the U.S. and the latter by China, two nations currently butting heads over trade, investment and influence in the Asia-Pacific. That’s complicated by China being the fastest-growing foreign investor in Australia: scooping up everything from farmland to Sydney apartment blocks, and generating a political and social backlash in the process. The U.S. still remains by far the biggest overall overseasinvestor in Australia, with China seventh in 2016 rankings, government data shows. The Shopping List Chinese investors are snapping up Australian property and infrastructure Source: KPMG, University of Sydney Note: Chinese outbound direct investment in Australia 2016 (excl. residential property) Irvine, 71, was appointed FIRB chairman last year in the wake of a debacle over Chinese firms’ efforts to buy a power network in New South Wales state. He’d previously headed up Australia’s domestic and foreign spy agencies and served as the nation’s ambassador to China, providing him with a rounded view of Australia’s position in the international arena. “It’s somewhat understandable, but I think it’s a mistake to look at foreign investment in Australia only through the prism of Chinese investment and of developments in Australia-China relations,” Irvine said. “The facts are that Australia has always welcomed and indeed encouraged foreign investment into our country. We’re a capital-importing country.” China’s emerging role as a major investor comes as governments, particularly at the state level, are offloading utilities to help finance roads and rail projects. For local authorities, the size of Chinese checkbooks is enticing; for federal officials it raises questions over what infrastructure is essential, what is connected to national security and what’s in the national interest. In response, Australia has established the Critical Infrastructure Centre to create a register of assets including water, ports and energy. It assesses risks such as espionage and cyber security, and Irvine said FIRB will be looking to the CIC for advice on foreign bids. Happy Customer China led Australia’s foreign investment approvals in fiscal 2016 Source: Foreign Investment Review Board Note: Data is for total approvals 2015-16 The CIC was created in the wake of the Ausgrid fiasco, when two Chinese bidders for the electricity network were vetoed at the 11th hour on national security grounds, leaving global investors scratching their heads about whether Australia really wanted their cash. Irvine is seeking to improve the predictability of FIRB decisions. “Whatever views people may have had of FIRB in the past, the current government is very keen to see people talk to the FIRB early,” he said. The environment is growing more complex. Australia is planning 5G mobile phone networks — and the technology of China’s Huawei Technologies Co. will likely be competitive with U.S. and European rivals on price and performance. The company was blocked from tending for contracts in Australia’s national broadband network in 2012 on security concerns. President Donald Trump raised concerns with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over Huawei and security, local media reported in March. Australia’s parliament passed a bill Thursday protecting critical infrastructure. It strengthens the government’s hand to combat espionage, sabotage and coercion arising from foreign involvement in the nation’s assets. Biggest Partner China isn’t just a keen investor in Australia, it’s the nation’s largest trading partner. It buys around a third of Australian exports and dominates iron ore and education, the nation’s No. 1 and No. 3 overseas earners. China is also increasingly trying to harness the influence its commercial relationships provide. As tensions rise over construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea, so have perceptions of China as a potential enemy. In 2017, 46 percent of Australian adults said it’s likely China will become a military threat to Australia in the next 20 years, up 7 percentage points from 2015, according to a Lowy Institute survey. “How you negotiate the ups and downs of a relationship between two very different countries and two very different cultures, that of course all requires management,” Irvine said. “But I certainly see Australia’s future not excluding a very strong economic partnership with China. I personally approach investment proposals from China with that objective in mind.” — With assistance by Kimberley Painter","AUS","none",0,0,0,0

China dairy giant Mengniu recently received approval from the ACCC to buy parts of the Australian dairy industry for $1.5 billion. Mr Joyce told Sky News host Chris Kenny he wanted to make sure “Australian industries are Australian owned”. “When you get an excess of 70 per cent which is foreign owned you’re starting to have… your own domestic control taken away”. He said the main danger of the sale was that the mechanism of pricing in Australia could become determined by the “whims of those who are overseas”. According to Mr Joyce, if a large section of the dairy industry were operated by a multinational company, the Australian market could be supplied by imported produce from any corner of the world.

Robbie Katter slams the LNP and ALP for selling off remaining dairy industry assets to a Chinese government company. “Governments have proven time and again that they are less than willing to correct that imbalance.” The State Member for Traeger said it was a bad outcome for the nation’s dairy farmers. “While foreign investment is nothing new to the dairy industry, it still remains a characteristic of the government culture in Australia,” he said. Federal Member for Kennedy, Bob Katter said he was sick of the blood sucking Sydney suits selling their country out. “They get their 30 pieces of sliver for selling their country but I am certain they will rot in Hell,” Mr Katter said. “The government is a joke. It’s not a government. It doesn’t bear any resemblance to a government. “They are not reflecting the will of the people. The only will Australia’s governments reflect is the one they see in the mirror.” Mr Katter said he was taking his fight against the foreign takeover of Australia to the Parliament; just last week he introduced the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment (Strategic Assets) Bill 2020.

Why can’t the remaining Dairy farmers start a co op and supply milk at a suitable price to the public. The current pollies look to what is good for them also to the next election to ensure they can keep their snout in the trough what is good for them but not what is good for the country.

In December, Payne said Yang was being shackled in his prison cell. The writer’s detention had strained ties already soured by Australia’s decision to ban Chinese technology equipment maker Huawei from its 5G broadband network and Canberra’s accusations of Beijing’s meddling in domestic affairs. “The government strongly objects to the formal indictment of Australian citizen and academic Dr Yang Hengjun in China on suspicion of espionage,” Payne said in an e-mailed statement, calling for his immediate release. It is unacceptable that Australian consular officials have been denied access to Yang since the end of 2019, she added. A former Chinese diplomat turned online journalist and blogger, Yang was formally arrested in August 2019 on suspicion of espionage, seven months after originally being detained in the southern city of Guangzhou. Espionage is punishable by death in China. Australia denies that Yang has ever spied for it. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said Australia should respect China’s judicial sovereignty. He urged it to “cease interfering by any means in China’s handling of legal cases according to law”, and reiterated that Yang’s legal rights have been guaranteed. Consular visits had been suspended during a coronavirus pandemic that emerged late last year in China but would resume once the situation “stabilises and makes a turn for the better,” Geng told a daily briefing. China is Australia’s largest trading partner, and previous diplomatic spats have disrupted exports of coal and wine, as Canberra has become increasingly wary about Beijing’s influence within its borders and across the Pacific. Last year, Reuters reported that Canberra had determined that Beijing was responsible for a cyber-attack on Australia’s parliament and three largest political parties, just months before an election.

Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the “Chinese public” could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China’s foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. “Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?” Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have “second thoughts” about visiting Australia. “The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia’s biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an “honest assessment” of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO’s role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. “China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesn’t mean the virus originated in China,” he told reporters. “Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed.” The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago Billionaire miner Andrew Forrest has been accused of ambushing the Australian government after he parachuted one of China’s top diplomats into an official event, blindsiding Health Minister Greg Hunt. Mr Forrest, the Fortescue chairman, surprised Mr Hunt by inviting China’s consul-general for Victoria Zhou Long to speak alongside him on Wednesday after he secured 10 million coronavirus tests from China, a 20-fold increase in Australia’s testing capacity. Health Minister Greg Hunt walks away from Chinese consul-general Zhou Long and Andrew Forrest after the press conference.Credit:AAP The audacious bid to mend a deteriorating political relationship between Beijing and Canberra follows increasing pressure from corporate leaders for Australia to back down on its public threats to pursue China’s role in the coronavirus outbreak. Beijing has spent the past week accusing Australia of being a bully pushing US interests in the region and warned Chinese consumers could walk out on Australian brands if it continues to lobby for a global independent inquiry into the disease. Mr Hunt did not introduce Mr Zhou and did not allow him to take questions. The Foreign Minister's Office and the Prime Minister's Office also were not informed of Mr Zhou's attendance at the media event, which was held at the Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Melbourne. Mr Zhou used the opportunity to repudiate the Australian government's criticisms and praise China's handling of the crisis. The consul-general said China had worked in an ""open, transparent and responsible"" manner with the World Health Organisation. Government sources said the hijacking of the press conference could work in Australia's favour by demonstrating it was willing to put a week of escalating tensions behind it. Mr Forrest, who has made significant investments in China through iron ore, urged Australia and global health authorities to delay any inquiry into the virus until after the US election in November and said it should not just be focussed on China. ""That would make it instantly political,"" he said. ""Australia needs to walk that line where we have a best friend in America, a best friend in China, best friends across South-East Asia."" Victorian Liberal senator James Paterson said Mr Forrest ""is worth listening to on how to run a successful mining company. I don’t think the government will be following his advice on foreign policy.” China’s consul-general for Victoria Zhou Long (right) and Health Minister Greg Hunt.Credit:AAP Another Liberal MP, Tim Wilson, said ""in a diplomatic disagreement it's a pretty basic expectation for Australians to be loyal and back their own, not invite a platform for a foreign spokesperson”. Other MPs said Mr Hunt was clearly ambushed and given little warning. The chairman of medical company BGI, Wang Jian, praised the strength of the business relationship between Mr Forrest and China. Mr Wang sold the test kits to Mr Forrest's philanthropic Minderoo Foundation for $320 million. ""We were able to protect supply chains for this extremely rare equipment and have Andrew deliver it straight to Australia,"" he said. The privately sourced kits will see Australia's testing capacity bolstered by 10 million more tests as it looks to expand asymptomatic testing and re-open the economy. As of Wednesday, Australia has conducted more than 500,000 tests. Tony Battaglene, chief executive of industry group Australian Grape and Wine, said he was concerned about the ongoing broader diplomatic spat between China and Australia being played out in public. ""[The market] is even more important now with COVID-19, in that China is going to be the first export market to recover in the world and we need to be in a position to take advantage of that. Because that will drive our recovery,"" he said. China is going to be the first export market to recover in the world and we need to be in a position to take advantage of that. ""I don't think tit-for-tat stuff through the media is the right way to treat a respected trading partner. And I think if Australia wants to talk about these things then it needs to actually go to China individually, or else work through a coalition with the UN."" Bega Cheese chairman Barry Irvin said he hoped the dispute would be resolved and ""good relations are restored in a reasonable amount of time"". Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday Australia would press ahead with its pursuit of the inquiry after calling European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen overnight.

""Australian side's erroneous words and deeds recently have upset the Chinese people and that may impact bilateral relations,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday night. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said China’s criticisms of Australia were ""ludicrous"".

But increased competition across the globe to obtain PPE has led to countries like China driving up the prices, according to The Daily Telegraph. Chinese companies have jacked up the price of face masks being sold to Australia by 1,000 per cent during the coronavirus pandemic. Pictured: Health workers at a drive through COVID-19 testing centre The international procurement squad, overseen by Police Commissioner Mick Fuller and organised by businessman Rod McGeoch, have used business contacts to forge international deals. Mr McGeoch - who was a driving force behind Sydney securing their 2000 Olympics bid - said there had been price hikes by China. 'There have been shifts in the prices as demand has become so intense but nonetheless we have audit controls,' he told the publication. 'Having beaten China for the Olympics by one vote I always wondered if they'd one day make me pay for it - maybe that's why the prices are going up.' A senior government minister claimed the Chinese approach was borderline 'extortion' but was confident the team was securing the best deals on the table.

In sourcing contacts, Mr McGeoch said neurosurgeon Charlie Teo connected him to a Chinese contact in Sydney, while former UBS banker Matthew Grounds linked them to contacts through management consulting firm McKinsey and Atlassian founder Scott Farquhar. Health Minister Brad Hazzard praised the commitment in ensuring NSW frontline workers access the equipment they need. 'I'm blown away by the work that not only health but police, treasury, customer service, investment and the private sector are doing to get to the front line all of the PPE that the rest of the world is scrambling on,' he said.

Global Times editor Hu Xijin said relations between Canberra and Beijing were likely to deteriorate further as Australia pushed for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus. “After the epidemic, we need to have more risk awareness when doing business with Australia and also when we send our children to study there,” Mr Hu wrote on Weibo. “Australia is always there, making trouble. It is a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of China’s shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off.” Mr Hu’s scathing attack was the latest in a series from Chinese state media as Australia continues to demand an inquiry into the origins of coronavirus. The coronavirus outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. As it spread around the world, it has infected more than three million people, including nearly 7000 Australians. So far, 212,000 people have died worldwide. Ambassador Cheng Jingye has floated a Chinese consumer boycott of Australian products, including agriculture, education and tourism in response to the probe. The Chinese embassy also controversially released details of a private conversation with Australia’s top diplomat. “Ambassador Cheng elaborated clearly China’s relevant position, stressing that no matter what excuses the Australian side has made, the fact cannot be buried that the proposal is a political manoeuvre,” an embassy spokesperson said. “Just as a Western saying goes: Cry up wine and sell vinegar.” The saying is a reference to offering up a good product but substituting it with a sham. With relations in the doldrums, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is refusing to back down on his push for a global coronavirus inquiry. “We will of course continue to support moves to ensure there is a proper independent assessment of what has occurred here,” he said on Wednesday. “It is not a remarkable position. It is a fairly common sense position and one that we don’t resile from.” Mr Morrison said he would keep up the pressure for an investigation ahead of a World Health Assembly meeting in May. Earlier, China released details of Mr Cheng’s phone call with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson in a major departure from diplomatic convention. After DFAT expressed regret over the release, the Chinese embassy retaliated by accusing Australia of leaking details of the phone call first. “The Embassy of China doesn’t play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,” a spokesman said. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton censured the ambassador for releasing details of the private call. “I think some of the comments are very much out of line and regrettable,” he told 5AA Radio. “We aren’t going to be held to ransom or succumb to threats from anybody.” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg described China’s latest criticisms of Australia as ludicrous. “We won’t bow to economic coercion, we will continue to talk up in Australia’s national interest and we won’t trade off health outcomes for economic outcomes,” he told Sky News. Labor leader Anthony Albanese echoed Mr Morrison in downplaying the significance of a coronavirus inquiry. “I regard as completely unremarkable the idea that there should be an investigation into this,” he told Sky. Crossbench senator Rex Patrick will have a sixth crack at establishing a parliamentary inquiry into relations with China when parliament sits next month. “The ambassador revealed China’s true diplomatic face and confirmed concerns about China’s preference for control and coercion rather than partnership,” he said. -with AAP Get The New Daily free every morning and evening.

Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the “Chinese public” could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China’s foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. “Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?” Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have “second thoughts” about visiting Australia. “The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia’s biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an “honest assessment” of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO’s role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. “China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesn’t mean the virus originated in China,” he told reporters. “Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed.” The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

Ambassador Cheng Jingye on Monday said the push was “dangerous” and could encourage Chinese citizens to not purchase Australian exports or travel to the nation. The government however is not backing down from the call for an independent inquiry, with Foreign Minister Marise Payne criticising the threat of an economic hit due to the push. “Australia has made a principled call for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak, an unprecedented global crisis with severe health, economic and social impacts,” she said. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global co-operation.” Per Yahoo, China’s ambassador in Australia has warned that demands for a probe into the spread of the coronavirus could lead to a consumer boycott of Aussie wine or trips Down Under. Australia has joined the United States in calling for a thorough investigation of how the virus transformed from a localised epidemic in central China into a pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people, forced billions into isolation and torpedoed the global economy. In a thinly veiled threat, ambassador Cheng Jingye warned the push for an independent inquest into the origins of the outbreak was “dangerous”. “The Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what Australia is doing now,” he claimed in an interview with the Australian Financial Review published on Sunday. “If the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think ‘why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China?’ The tourists may have second thoughts,” he added. “It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?'” Cheng also threatened the flow of Chinese students to Australian universities, a key source of revenue that is already under threat from pandemic travel restrictions. “The parents of the students would also think whether this place which they found is not so friendly, even hostile, whether this is the best place to send their kids here,” he said. The comments mark a significant escalation in tensions between Beijing and Canberra, whose relations are already strained. They also reflect the willingness of a new generation of Chinese diplomats to aggressively and publicly push Communist Party interests, using Chinese economic might as leverage if necessary. Experts have said a full investigation into the coronavirus outbreak could prompt scrutiny of China’s rulers and their response to the crisis, and open the door for the type of criticism of the Party that is rarely tolerated.","AUS","chinese",0,0,0,0

"154",669,"https://smallcaps.com.au/chinese-trade-western-australia-post-covid-19-mines-minister-bill-johnston/","Chinese trade still on radar for Western Australia post COVID-19 according to mines minister Bill Johnston"," Western Australia’s Minister for Mines and Petroleum Bill Johnston has dismissed suggestions that trade relations between his economic powerhouse state and China may take a hit in the wake of the deadly coronavirus. In a wide-ranging interview with Small Caps, Mr Johnston said after a record year for sales in the resource sector, to the tune of $166 billion, trade between WA and China remained a top priority. “China is a key economic partner for the Western Australian resources industry so if they come back strongly then that will obviously benefit us.” There’s mounting speculation China will recover from the ravages of coronavirus by July and Mr Johnston said the benefits for his state were enormous. “We’ve been lucky, iron ore volumes have remained fairly steady even at the height of the health problems in China and that means there has been some strength in the iron ore price and we’re very pleased with that,” he said. “We have a strong trading relationship with China because it’s in our mutual interests. China needs resources and we are a great low-cost provider of resources.” On top the of the best sales for the sector the industry also employed 133,094 workers in WA, another record, up from 120,511 in 2018. While China’s appetite for Australian resources is unlikely to slow down, Mr Johnston admitted the effects of COVID-19 demonstrated the need to have “strong multiple logistics chains”. He said the battery space was a new window to grow in Western Australia. “We’re very strongly of the view that further processing of raw materials here in Western Australia is a good business case and one of those reasons is that it would allow the users of those materials to have a security of supply rather than relying one logistics chain,” he said. “So, we do think there is a strong reason for a continued chemical processing of battery materials, and we’ve been talking to a range of investors globally and we think that COVID-19 has strongly endorsed the challenges of relying on one logistics partner.” “There is a real opportunity for investment for further processing of battery materials here in Western Australia for the supply of potential domestic users but also for partnering with a whole range of countries for their electric vehicle responses.” With WA’s hard border in place, the state government is determined to limit the spread of COVID-19 particularly in regional and remote areas. Under WA Premier Mark McGowan’s strict lock-out measures, no-one can cross the border into WA unless it’s an essential service.” Fly-in fly-out workers have been given access to come from inter-state, but they must serve the mandatory 14-day quarantine before being allowed on site. According to Mr Johnston, mining companies are doing their bit to comply with the law of the land. “People are moving to longer swings for FIFO work to reduce the number of transport movements. They’re introducing very strict social distancing policies at work camps and are working very hard on their pandemic plans to make sure the virus won’t spread among work groups.” “We are of course exempting workers from the internal Western Australia borders that we’ve established, but again the reduction in movement is very important to our management of the pandemic.” Mr Johnston stopped short, however, in saying he’d shut down an operation if a worker tested positive to COVID-19. “We’ll always respond to any development if there was a worker to be caught with the affliction on site … there are actions to be taken by the company, but the first thing would be to evacuate the worker to hospital or to other care and then isolate the workgroup,” he said. “We’d then have to see what we’d do with the worksite but clearly the first effort is to prevent COVID-19 getting into a work camp.” Meanwhile, there’s growing scepticism about the future of FIFO workforces once the COVID-19 threat wanes with Australian Government Resources Minister Keith Pitt throwing doubt over its practicality. Mr Pitt told a national newspaper this week he felt more and more companies would lean towards establishing residential workforces. It’s a philosophy Mr Johnston partially agrees with but noted WA’s mining operations were often on a different scale compared to those on Australia’s east coast. “Many operations are extremely remote, and there is not really a practical way to do anything other than fly-in fly-out,” he said. “On the other hand for those mines that are closer to established communities we have always called for companies to give people more choice so that if people want to live residentially they can and those who choose a FIFO lifestyle can choose that.” “I’m concerned when I hear about mining companies insisting on workers doing fly-in fly-out from Perth rather than allowing drive-in drive-out say from Port Hedland if that’s a closer community.” “There shouldn’t be an inflexibility from employers to prevent people from living in regional communities if that’s their choice.”   Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); ","AUS","none",0,0,0,0

Mr Jingye spoke with government officials on Sunday. He said Chinese embassies “have been very forthright in terms of publicising on twitter and things like that, which is banned in china of course, but publicising the assistance that China has offered to countries that are suffering through the pandemic”. “I think you can see that there is a lot of sensitivity with China that they’re wanting to sort of get their side of the narrative out there,” he said. “They are sort of very much more aware of getting their message out in western media and trying to shape the debate.” Image: News Corp Australia Read More Our Apps","AUS","chinese",0,0,0,0

Wondering just how Australian Virgin Australia really is, I looked around and the most recent information I could find is an article from SBS. https://www.sbs.com.au/news/virgin-australia-s-ownership-in-spotlight In summary; Now this tallies to 75.6% with no mention 24.6% ownership details. Regardless, it appears Virgin Australian is a minor owner, with three other countries filling out the balance. I’m tired of hearing about Chinese interests waiting to pounce on Aussie business etc in trouble. In this case, perhaps the headlines are a little misleading to gain attention, or, perhaps it will be another buyout by China. Without accounting for the 24.6 %, Chinese interests have a pretty good chunk of the airline available if New Zealand sell. It would be good to keep at least some of Virgin Australia as Australian and the QLD Gov’t intends to go halfway with, I’m guessing, the Federal Gov’t to achieve that. The Federal Gov’t doesn’t consider the rescue necessary. What about Qantas? Was there not a moratorium put in place by the Morrison Gov’t, to review any such monetary investments post COVID-19? Will the company collapse or will we still have our Aussie Virgins flying the skies?

In a recent interview with the Australian Financial Review, Cheng said Scott Morrison’s push for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a boycott from the people of China, risking economic repercussions. He also repeated recent criticisms that Australia was “teaming up” with the US government to “launch a kind of political campaign against China”. “It’s a kind of pandering to the assertions that are made by some forces in Washington,” he said. READ MORE: Frydenberg defends Dutton after Chinese Embassy comments Cheng suggested Chinese tourists and students may stop visiting Australia, and the public may choose not to consume Australian products. “The Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what Australia is doing now,” he said. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham on Tuesday told ABC News Adamson had called the ambassador following the comments, but wouldn’t reveal details of the discussion. “That’s for the ambassador to choose to make public,” he said. He said the federal government would continue to push for an investigation. “Australia is no more going to change our policy position on a major public health issue because of economic coercion or threats of coercion, than we would change our policy position in matters of national security,” he said. However, he noted Australia was still keen to maintain a positive relationship with China. “Our economy is a crucial supplier to the Chinese economy, just as China’s economy supplies valuable goods, resources and services to Australia’s economy,” he said. “We want to maintain that positive relationship and enhance it where we can.” Scott Morrison, foreign affairs minister Marise Payne, and home affairs minister Peter Dutton have all vocalised their support for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, calling for transparency from the Chinese government.

While running a Reverse Image Search on the keyframes from the video along with the keywords, we came across a Daily Mail article. The byline was for Daily Mail Australia. It shows that the two individuals were fighting over the purchase of baby formula. The article states that Big W and major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths enforce a two-tin baby formula limit due to the popularity of ‘daigou shoppers’ buying the product in bulk to sell for a profit online to China.  The two men got into a brawl when the older man asked the younger individual to put back the baby formula tin. The couple can be seen holding tins. According to the woman who posted the original video, the young couple had already been inside the store to purchase four tins. The couple in question in this video were later told that they couldn’t buy the tins and were asked to leave. Hence, it is not true that Chinese people are no longer allowed in Australian supermarkets.

Andrew Forrest, head of mining giant Fortescue, said he had used contacts to secure an order for the tests with Chinese genomics firm BGI Group at a significantly lower cost than from rival providers, amid fierce competition. Australia, which has been one of the most successful countries in containing COVID-19, has so far carried out around 500,000 tests in a population of 25 million people. Delivery of the new tests would dramatically improve the country's track-and-trace programme and help build the kind of monitoring needed to reopen the country's economy, said Health Minister Greg Hunt. ""What that says to Australians is we have the supply lines, we have the health capacity and we have the pathway back (to normality),"" he said. The deal comes with Australia and China at loggerheads over the pandemic. China's ruling Communist Party has angrily dismissed Australian calls for an independent investigation into the spread of the disease from the Chinese city of Wuhan. Beijing's ambassador Down Under this week threatened a trade boycott if calls for an investigation continued, leading to a public rebuke by Australian authorities. The deal comes with Australia and China at loggerheads over the pandemic Photo: AFP / Saeed KHAN US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has piled pressure on China over the pandemic, waded into the dispute Wednesday as he sarcastically said that Australia upset Beijing through its ""temerity"" to ask questions. ""Who in the world wouldn't want an investigation of how this happened to the world?"" Pompeo told reporters in Washington. ""The solution to this crisis will come from freedom-loving people around the world. I'm very confident that authoritarian regimes are poorly designed to deal with the kind of crisis that this pandemic has engendered,"" he said. Just hours after the latest verbal volley between Beijing and Canberra, the Chinese consul general in the state of Victoria, Zhou Long, spoke at the announcement of the testing deal -- calling it a tribute to the ""friendship and the cooperation between our two countries"". China had released information related to COVID-19 in an ""open, transparent and responsible manner"", he said. Australia's vast mining industry is deeply reliant on Chinese business and China has depended on Australian resources to fuel its rapid economic and infrastructure development. Forrest said his Minderoo Foundation had set aside Aus$320 million ($210 million) to assist the project, which will eventually be paid back by the taxpayer. Australia has confirmed more than 6,700 COVID-19 infections and 90 deaths, with the number of new cases falling below 20 per day for the past week. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the country was ""not too far away"" from easing social-distancing measures in place for more than a month.","AUS","chinese",0,0,0,0

So far, 59 thousand 141 people have died from coronavirus worldwide. The number of infected has reached 10 lakh 98 thousand. At the same time, two lakh 28 thousand 405 people have also become healthy. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in an interview to a news channel on Thursday that China's weight market (meat grazing) was behind the coronavirus infection. He appealed to the World Health Organization (WLHO) and the United Nations (UN) to take action against the meat market. He said that this Chinese market is a serious threat to other countries and people of the world. Corona is believed to have started in December last year from the illegal cattle market in Wuhan.  New York: Infection cases exceed one million  In the US, about 1480 people have died in 24 hours (Thursday 8.30 to Friday 8.30), while more than 32 thousand cases of infection have been reported. With this, now 7 thousand 392 people have lost their lives in the US and two lakh 77 thousand are infected. According to the New York Times, 562 people died in New York from Thursday midnight to Friday midnight. That is, one person has died every two and a half minutes. This is the largest figure of those who died in a day. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday — he has signed an order that states that hospitals in the state that have less need for ventilators will be moved to hospitals that are suffering from deficiency. They said that they would not let people die like this. There have been more than one lakh cases of infection in the state.  America: Trump said - elections will be held on time  According to the New York Times, President Donald Trump has said that the elections will be held on November 3 at its scheduled time. They said that they are not in support of the ballot used for voting. Voting should be done at the polling booth. However, several states have postponed elections due to Corona and the Democratic Party has also postponed the nomination conference to be held between July and August due to the epidemic. CDC recommends wearing cloth masks: Trump During a press briefing at the White House on Friday, President Trump said, ""The CDC has stated in its recommendation that citizens can use non-medical clothes (clothing) as they wish."" That he himself would not wear a mask. The news agency Xinhua said in its report that the CDC's recommendations are based on recent research. Trump said the CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks. The N95 Respirator Mask needs to be saved for medical staff.

The coronavirus outbreak, dubbed COVID-19, which broke out at the close of 2019, has led to a medical emergency across the world, with the World Health Organization officially declaring the novel coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In an attempt to avoid contraction in the overall economy, the Australian government has so far announced two economic packages. The first, unveiled on March 12, is a A$17.6bn ($12.4bn) stimulus package, including tax relief for small businesses and one-off cash payments. The second is a A$66bn ($46.4bn) safety net' economic package that provides cash payments for SMEs as well as financial assistance for households, retirees, and sole traders. In addition, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) twice reduced the bank interest rate in March - each time by 25 basis points, with the bank rate now at a historic low of 0.25%. The RBA will also disburse at least A$90bn ($63.3bn) to banks over a three-year period at 0.25% for SME lending. This report focuses on the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on both the economy and the cards and payments industry in Australia. Based on proprietary datasets, the snapshot provides a detailed comparison between pre-COVID-19 forecasts and revised forecasts of total payment card, debit card, and credit and charge card transactions by value and volume. It also offers information on measures taken by the government to combat coronavirus.

Water ownership in Australia is an increasingly lucrative investment for both domestic and overseas buyers. The reduction of water available in key river systems has seen the price of water steadily rise. Water has been a tradable commodity since water rights were ""unbundled"" from agriculture and property interests. Since 2014, restrictions on trading water allocations were also relaxed in the Murray-Darling Basin. Despite water's essential value, there are increasing concerns about the amount of oversight of water markets compared to financial or property markets. ""It is a commodity and yet it doesn't have the same governance and due diligence around it as other commodities like gold or minerals, and I think that's what's of concern to people,"" Mick Keelty, former Australian Federal Police commissioner and now the interim inspector general of Murray-Darling Basin Water Resources, told 7.30. 7.30 has been investigating how water entitlements held by foreign investors are regulated in Australia and has identified at least two Chinese state-owned enterprises that own water entitlements. Contact Paul Farrell using the Signal secure messaging app on +61457262172, or at paulfarrell1@protonmail.com or using the ABC's SecureDrop server. Unibale Pty Ltd is listed as an Australian subsidiary of the state-owned COFCO Corporation, one of China's major agriculture companies. Unibale Pty Ltd owns more than 7,000 megalitres of water entitlements in the Gwydir River system in the northern end of the Murry-Darling Basin in New South Wales. The conduct of another COFCO subsidiary, Chinatex Australia, has been criticised in Federal Parliament over its failure to pay a sizeable Federal Court order to compensate a local beef provider. COFCO and Unibale Pty Ltd did not respond to questions from 7.30. 7.30 can also reveal that private foreign investors buying into Australia's water markets are largely exempt from investment restrictions put in place to prevent a fire sale takeover of Australian assets during the coronavirus pandemic. Duncan Bedford, a partner at law firm McCullough Robertson, told 7.30 that water purchases by private foreign investors will generally not be scrutinised by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). That is despite new restrictions being imposed by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg that require the FIRB to review essentially all foreign purchases in Australia for assets such as land and real estate. The restrictions were announced due to concerns that large foreign investors would try to capitalise on the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the measures imposed by the Government effectively apply to all land purchases, Mr Bedford says water assets largely fall outside the review board's oversight, with the exception of direct purchases by foreign governments. ""The acquisition of water entitlements is treated as the acquisition of a business asset and doesn't fall within any of the categories that require compulsory FIRB approval,"" Mr Bedford said. ""FIRB approval may be required for the acquisition of water assets when it forms part of a broader business acquisition. But on their own, water entitlements do not require FIRB approval."" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told 7.30 in a statement: ""The foreign investment review framework balances the need to ensure Australia remains an attractive destination for foreign investment while also ensuring individual foreign investments are not contrary to the national interest. ""The Government also recognises the importance of transparency around foreign ownership of agricultural land and water. For this reason, the Government introduced public registers covering foreign investment into these asset classes."" Concerns about the acquisition of water assets by foreign investors are primarily around the level of oversight. ""Why does water escape the same sort of scrutiny that other foreign investments have to put themselves through?"" Mr Keelty said. ""I think the more we treat it the same as other high-value commodities in the market, the less concerned the community will be about it."" The most significant attempt to gain a greater understanding of foreign ownership of water was made in 2017, when the Federal Government passed new laws creating a foreign ownership register. The register, which is managed by the Australian Tax Office, is a self-reporting regime where entities that own water are required to declare their interests. The 2018 report shows that across each state and territory, about 10 per cent of all water assets are held by foreign entities. The largest investors are from the United States and China, followed by the United Kingdom. But the register itself is not public, so there is no information about individual owners or even the water holdings of state-owned enterprises. ""I think what is of concern is that it is a voluntary scheme to identify yourself to the Tax Office and register yourself with the Tax Office, that you are a foreign investor in water … it's an honour system,"" Mr Keelty told 7.30. There has also been limited enforcement by the ATO to ensure that all foreign water owners have registered their interests. ""As I say in the report that I delivered to the Government towards the end of last year, there is no compliance action taken by the Australian Tax Office,"" Mr Keelty said. Farmers Federation chief executive Tony Maher also said the register currently does not offer enough information about the extent of foreign investment. ""It's out of date and there isn't enough detail about who owns what water and what they're doing with it,"" he said. ""Particularly off the back of the driest period this country's ever seen, we need more transparency and more data on what is happening in the water market right now."" A spokeswoman for the ATO said the agency has had ""limited opportunities"" for compliance activity since the register was established. She added that it was unable to publish more detailed information about foreign investments. ""There are no exceptions allowing protected information to be disclosed publicly,"" she said. ""We have worked to establish the register and produce the first report and there has been limited opportunity for compliance action. To date, no penalties have been issued."" Each state and territory administers its own water register, but there are complex overlaps between different levels of government and even between government agencies. Issues like foreign ownership would generally be considered a matter for the federal government. In NSW, more than 38,000 water licences have been issued but individual ownership is difficult to determine. The register itself is not freely accessible and a fee must be paid for every search. In order to conduct a search for the owners of water licences currently issued in NSW, it would cost approximately $558,600 to search the entire register. A spokeswoman for NSW Water Minister Melinda Pavey said: ""The NSW Government is already working to improve the transparency of trades in NSW by publishing an online trade dashboard that provides allocation and entitlement trade volumes and a weighted average price. ""The extent of domestic and foreign ownership in the Murray-Darling Basin water market is currently the subject of an extensive review being conducted by both the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] and the MDBA [Murray–Darling Basin Authority]. We look forward to both reports being finalised and made public."" A spokesman for Water NSW told 7.30 it processed water licence applications in strict accordance with Government regulations, including whether an applicant had a legal entitlement to hold a licence. ""The public water register is administered on behalf of the NSW Government by the office of NSW Land Registry Services,"" he said. ""With respect to the public availability of customer information, Water NSW operates within the legislative framework as required, and otherwise seeks to balance transparency with the right to privacy."" There has been substantial discussion in recent months about the future of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement and the management of water assets across the country. Mr Keelty has recently completed a report that found a significant reduction in the amount of water flowing into the river system. He spent several months visiting community groups and consistently heard accounts from farmers and irrigators frustrated with the complexities of the system. ""There needs to be more transparency around how this Murray-Darling Basin is governed,"" he said. The ownership and trading of water is a divisive issue within many communities. ""There is a segment of the community who says, 'why should people own water who don't have any interest in agriculture?'"" Mr Keelty said. ""Equally, there's a section of the community that says, 'well, the Government made this decision that gave us some options to trade in water and we have actually invested in that trade'."" The ACCC is currently undertaking a major report into water trading markets in the Murray-Darling Basin. A spokeswoman for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority said that water markets and licences are the responsibility of each state government. ""The MDBA supports greater transparency in the water market in order to build public confidence, which is essential,"" she said. ""MDBA's main task is to ensure that water extraction in the Basin is sustainable and that compliance by the states is robust. Both the ACCC and MDBA have a role in regulating water markets, but this doesn't extend to the ownership of water.""

Unibale Pty Ltd - a subsidary of major state-owned Chinese agriculture company COFCO Corporation - has acquired 7,000 megalitres of water in the Gwydir River system in the north of New South Wales' Murray-Darling Basin. Foreign investors in the region emerged after the easing of basin trading rules in 2014 - which allowed companies to buy and sell water more easily. Former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty, who is now the Inspector General of the basin's water resources, said many in the community were frustrated by the arrival of interloper companies to buy up the scarce resource.

A Chinese communist party-owned company is buying up rights to Australia's scarce water supply 'There is a segment of the community who says why should people own water who don't have any interest in agriculture?' he told 7.30. 'Equally, there's a section of the community that says, ""well, the government made this decision that gave us some options to trade in water and we have actually invested in that trade.""' Water is already scarce in the region - which has struggled through 'extreme drought' for the past two years, according to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It is not clear what Unibale are doing with the water supply but Daily Mail Australia has contacted COFCO Corporation for comment. Mr Keelty said while a foreign ownership register was introduced in 2017 which required overseas companies to declare their interests, the register was not accessible to the public. He added the sale and purchase of water commodities was not overseen to the same degree by the government as materials like gold or minerals. 'It is a commodity and yet it doesn't have the same governance and due diligence around it as other commodities, and that's what's of concern to people,' Mr Keelty said. Former AFP commissioner Mick Keelty (pictured) said many in the community were frustrated non-agricultural companies were free to buy up water supplies McCullough Robertson law firm partner Duncan Bedford said the Chinese acquisition skirted around the Foreign Investment Review Board. 'FIRB approval may be required for the acquisition of water assets when it forms part of a broader business acquisition. But on their own, water entitlements do not require FIRB approval,' he said. Adding to the frustration of farmers in the Murray-Darling region, the perceived lack of government oversight comes despite the Treasury saying it would review nearly all foreign asset purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Locals are seen on the Louth bridge over the Darling Barka river, as a flow of water from upstream arrives on February 24, 2020. The Murray-Darling has fought through drought for the past two to three years The importance of water assets was highlighted when it recently emerged that Australia could soon run out of rice because of mismanagement of the water supply during the coronavirus pandemic. The Southern Murray, which stretches across the south-eastern states, is normally responsible for 60 per cent of the country's grain and dairy production. It is widely regarded as 'Australia's food bowl' but with the Murray in a state of zero-water allocation for the past two years, rice and dairy farms aren't growing produce. The Murray-Darling Basin stretches across the south-eastern states and covers South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales A general view of a parched Wilcannia weir on March 4, 2019 in north-western New South Wales 'Rice is definitely a big risk because we haven't been using the water we've got to grow rice,' Ms Slattery, a former employee of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, said. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has hit back though, saying: 'There is no problem with our food security and it’s mischievous and misleading for vested interest groups to use COVID-19 to push their biased and incorrect positions.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Unibale Pty Ltd for comment. 'The foreign investment review framework balances the need to ensure Australia remains an attractive destination for foreign investment while also ensuring individual foreign investments are not contrary to the national interest.

Australia was the second country, after the United States, to call for an independent inquiry into the global pandemic, a move which sparked a diplomatic row with China. But last night, at a meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, China indicated it would likely back a European Union motion that called for an ""impartial, independent and comprehensive"" evaluation of the response to the global outbreak. More than 100 countries, including Australia, had already co-signed the motion for the probe into the global outbreak. The motion then passed at the WHA gathering on Tuesday night. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Some Coalition MPs and senators have been cheered by the broad international support for the inquiry, with former Cabinet minister Matt Canavan saying Australia had been ""massively vindicated"" by the ""outpouring of support from other countries in the world"". But Beijing's embassy in Canberra issued a statement saying the inquiry being considered by the WHA was ""totally different"" to the one Australia proposed and to claim vindication was ""nothing but a joke"". ""A close look at the draft itself can easily come to such a conclusion,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""All those who know the consultation process that led to the resolution understand this. ""To claim the WHA's resolution a vindication of Australia's call is nothing but a joke."" The skirmish came after China imposed an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley overnight, all but killing a lucrative market for exporters. China's ambassador to Australia had previously warned there could be trade ramifications if the Federal Government pursued its bid for an investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Australia initially demanded that the inquiry be led by an organisation outside the World Health Organization (WHO), with Foreign Marise Payne saying it ""strikes me as a bit poacher and gamekeeper"". Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Australia has backed away — at least for now — from its call to hand WHO officials the same powers as weapons inspectors. But the Government argues that Australian officials worked hard to toughen up the language in the draft motion so it specifically says the inquiry must be impartial and independent. The Government also points out that the draft motion states the WHO should investigate the source of the virus, as well as how the virus jumped from animals to humans. Find out more Trade Minister Simon Birmingham called the embassy's comment ""provocative"" but said Australia would not engage in ""cheap politicking"" over COVID-19. ""I would have thought the appropriate response from China's ambassador would be to welcome these outcomes and welcome the opportunity for us to work together on this important issue,"" he told Sky News. Senator Canavan said the stoush demonstrated why Australia would ""need to move away from relying so much on China"". ""The conduct of the Chinese Government over this period, but also the last few years, has been hard to predict,"" he said. ""It's an increased risk for Australian business.

Tensions between the US and China have lately been focused around Beijing’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and Washington’s accusation of a cover-up regarding its severity and possible origin. Some of the US’ global allies, like Australia, have been following its lead, provoking Chinese displeasure. The Global Times, a popular Chinese tabloid generally considered to be reflective of the government’s position, ran with some pretty insulting words about Australia over its siding with the US’ position. The nation is a “giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US,” the paper cited an anonymous Chinese netizen as saying. Now it will “hit a deadlock with China on trade disputes in sectors like coal and beef. Hopefully, the US will compensate it!” the comment continued. The Global Times said it was an example of how Chinese people online were mocking Australia for subverting its national interests to support hawkish US foreign policy goals. The quote was interpreted by some Australian media outlets as Beijing alluding to possible repercussions for Australian businesses. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the Chinese government may target Australian goods – including wine, dairy, seafood, oatmeal, and fruit – with various restrictions, and call on the Chinese public to boycott products made in Australia. The article in the Global Times centered around this week’s session of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of the World Health Organization. The WHA passed a resolution calling for an investigation into the global response to Covid-19. Beijing was among the motion’s supporters, insisting it was now substantively different from what its early sponsors, including Australia, were aiming for. Beijing rejects the US’ accusations and says insinuations that it somehow mishandled or even initiated the pandemic are just an attempt by Washington to defer responsibility for its own botched response.

The Global Times – a publication well known for expressing the Chinese Government’s agenda – published comments from social media network Weibo of Chinese citizens unloading on Australia. “It seems that Australia, this giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US, will hit a deadlock with China on trade disputes in sectors like coal and beef. Hopefully, the US will compensate it,” one Weibo post read, as reported by The Global Times. The article preceded the damning comment by saying Chinese citizens had “mocked” Australia over its attempt “to become a martyr for defending so-called independence and transparency while its ideas are denounced by the global community”. It had said Australia’s demands for a probe into China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak have been rejected by the international community who had instead supported a World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution for a global investigation into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. It continued to criticise “some Western politicians” efforts to politicise a “post-epidemic evaluation” in attempts to spread anti-China rhetoric. This stance, the article argued, had been “officially denounced” by the global community, which it said would not accept “unfair and unscientific appeal”. The article also claimed that China was welcoming Australia to abandon “politicising the pandemic”, accusing the country of “playing the loyal deputy to the US in slandering China”. Three mistakes Australia must avoid to prevent second wave Hidden threat as pubs and cafes begin to open WHO warns coronavirus ‘may never go away’ “It (is) also mistakenly thought that China would be isolated by the international community at the WHA and wanted to bring Taiwan into the body,” Yu Lei, a researcher at the Research Centre for Pacific Island Countries at Liaocheng University, told the publication. “Australia also thought its proposal would get recognition from most of the WHO (World Health Organisation) member states, but the reality tells the opposite.” Australia sparked a diplomatic spat with China after calling for a global coronavirus inquiry. China has since slapped an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley and suspended imports from four major abattoirs. The WHA has adopted a resolution to establish an independent coronavirus inquiry with the support of a record 137 nations. The inquiry resolution does not mention China, instead committing to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the pandemic. With AAP Do you have a story tip?

On Monday night, Australia joined more than 100 countries at the World Health Assembly to co-sign a motion for an inquiry into the global outbreak. The WHA resolution calls for an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected to pass at the WHA gathering in Geneva later on Tuesday. Australia was the first country to call for an inquiry, a move that sparked a diplomatic row with China. Senior Coalition figures claim the inquiry vindicates the government’s stance, prompting a scathing response from China’s embassy in Australia. “The draft resolution on COVID-19 to be adopted by the World Health Assembly is totally different from Australia’s proposal of an independent international review,” a spokesman said on Tuesday. “To claim the WHA’s resolution a vindication of Australia’s call is nothing but a joke.” A close look at the draft motion “itself can easily come to such a conclusion”, the spokesman said. “All those who know the consultation process that led to the resolution understand this.” Senior cabinet minister David Littleproud denied the investigation was about confronting China. “This wasn’t about persecution, this was about understanding a pandemic that 300,000 souls lost their lives to,” he said on Tuesday. “We should be damn proud Australia is now leading the world.” Health Minister Greg Hunt argued Australia’s case for the inquiry at the assembly. He said the probe should look at health risks from wildlife wet markets, where the virus is likely to have originated in China. “We need to learn the lessons from this pandemic and ensure we have the strongest possible global health architecture, with an enhanced ability to prevent and respond to future outbreaks,” he said. Chinese President Xi Jinping also backed a World Health Organisation-led review, saying his country acted with openness, transparency and responsibility all along. “This work needs a scientific and professional attitude and needs to be led by the WHO. And the principles of objectivity and fairness need to be upheld,” Mr Xi told the meeting. Mr Xi also said China would stump up $3.1 billion in the next two years to help deal with the disease. The WHO promised the review would happen at the earliest appropriate time. US President Donald Trump supported the probe by tweeting an AAP Newswire/SBS story on the motion. He followed that up within hours with a threat to permanently freeze US funding to the WHO and reconsider US membership unless the organisation, which is governed by the WHA, reforms. “If the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership in the organisation,” Mr Trump told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday (Australian time). Mr Trump froze US funding to the WHO in April, after accusing the organisation of being “China-centric” and bungling management of the coronavirus outbreak. He said “so much death has been caused by their mistakes”. “It would have been so easy to be truthful,” Mr Trump said. “We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms.” The US contributed nearly $US900 million ($1.4 billion) to the WHO’s budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency’s website. That represents a fifth of its total $4.4 billion budget for those years. -with agencies Get The New Daily free every morning and evening. Follow The New Daily Copyright © 2022 The New Daily.

"199",867,"https://www.theepochtimes.com/proactive-stance-on-chinese-regime-benefited-australia-in-virus-response_3360070.html","Proactive Stance on Chinese Regime Benefited Australia in Virus Response","Commentary While many countries remain in COVID-19 pandemic lockdown or are just slowly starting to ease restrictions, Australia began opening up public beaches and relaxing rules in late April and has continued staying ahead of the curve in its efforts to protect its citizens’ lives. As of May 24, with a population of 25.7 million, Australia has seen approximately 7,110 cases of infection and 102 deaths as a result of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus. In contrast, as of May 24, Canada, with 37.9 million people, recorded over 84,000 cases and more than 6,300 deaths. By early April, Financial Times journalist John Burn-Murdoch had already taken note: “Australia a rare example of an Anglophone country on a gentle trajectory,” he wrote in a tweet. Now that more businesses are reopening and more internal travel bans are being lifted, some sense of normalcy is gradually returning. While no one knows when and how the pandemic will end, it’s important to reflect on how a country like Australia managed to beat the odds and what it can do to stay the course as it tackles the complex challenges ahead across all sectors of society. In this regard, much of Canberra’s success appears to stem from its vigilance and determined action when it comes to the Chinese communist regime. A key move that helped Australia contain the spread of the virus was closing the border to visitors from China on Feb. 1—despite Beijing’s protestations and against World Health Organization (WHO) advice. This was “the right decision” and “one of the most important decisions made by an Australian government in decades,” Health Minister Greg Hunt recently told Sky News. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese regime’s hoarding of personal protective equipment in January and February, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and hand sanitizer, led to shortages worldwide. Australia was no exception. As The Epoch Times previously reported, the regime had directed its United Front Work Department to mobilize overseas pro-Beijing groups to buy large quantities of these vital medical supplies and ship them to China. Greenland Group and Risland, two Chinese-linked companies in Australia, were widely reported by Australian media to have sent large volumes of protective equipment to China. According to Chinese government data, Beijing amassed an estimated 2.5 billion pieces of protective equipment in just two months. Canberra promptly announced a ban on the non-commercial export of these supplies, stipulating fines and jail terms for violating the ban. Meanwhile, global concerns arose over foreign takeovers of distressed companies amid the pandemic, especially by authoritarian states like Beijing, that could undermine supply chains and countries’ national security. In response, on March 29, Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced changes to the country’s foreign investment review policy, requiring every proposed foreign takeover to be reviewed regardless of value. This was to avoid “predatory behaviour that is not in the national interest” and would be effective for “the duration of the current crisis,” he said. Coincidentally, data from Australia’s Health Department indicated a noticeable downward trend of new daily cases shortly after that day, continuing until today. Then in mid-April, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for an independent review into the pandemic’s origins including Beijing’s handling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan. She quickly received backing from shadow foreign minister Penny Wong followed by support from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and others. The Chinese regime tried to discredit the request by accusing Canberra of politicizing the pandemic and warning that Chinese citizens may boycott Australia in various areas including beef, wine, tourism, and international students. When Canberra refused to back down, Beijing banned beef imports from four major Australian producers and imposed 80 percent tariffs on Australian barley. Despite Beijing’s disinformation and economic coercion, Canberra remained firm, winning support from over 120 countries for a co-sponsored motion seeking an independent evaluation of the global response to COVID-19 including the source of the virus and its route of transmission to humans. The WHO passed the motion at a virtual assembly on May 19. Australia’s vigilant response to the CCP during the pandemic is consistent with Canberra’s actions in recent years that clearly show its growing awareness of the urgency and necessity of resisting the threats posed by the communist regime. These threats are not limited to health and economic consequences but also include significant political interference and espionage activities. In 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a report on the extent of foreign interference in Australia. The classified report, which was leaked to the media in 2018, found that the CCP had over the past decade been making attempts to influence Australian political parties and policy-making at every level of government. In response, Turnbull’s government introduced legislation that banned foreign donations to political candidates, broadened the definition of espionage activities, and required all those working on behalf of foreign entities to publicly declare who they are working for. Australia was also one of the first countries to ban Huawei from its 5G networks on national security grounds. In 2018, Canberra blocked Huawei from providing 5G technology to Australia, while barring ZTE, another Chinese tech company, at the same time. “The fundamental issue is one of trust between nations in cyberspace,” wrote Simeon Gilding, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), in a commentary in January. “Over the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party has destroyed that trust through its scaled and indiscriminate hacking of foreign networks and its determination to direct and control Chinese tech companies,” added Gilding, who until December 2019 was head of the Australian Signals Directorate’s signals intelligence and offensive cyber missions. Due to concerns about cyber attacks originating from China, Australia had already excluded Huawei from bidding on a project to build out the country’s national broadband network back in 2012. Canberra’s vigilance combined with informed and timely action against the CCP could well be the most significant factor contributing to Australia’s much-better-than-expected pandemic outcome thus far. It also attests to the kind of sound China policy and direction that will likely continue to serve the country well in the critical times ahead. In this context, there is bipartisan backing and broad public support for Canberra’s decisions including its Huawei ban and its leadership in pushing for a global inquiry into the pandemic. And Beijing’s overt use of coercion and disinformation has damaged its own image and helped to alert Australians to the serious threat that it poses. “Managing relations with an assertive China requires Australian patience, consistency and steadfastness on policy over the long term,” wrote Richard Maude, executive director of policy at the Asia Society Australia, in an article in May. Maude is also a former Australian deputy secretary of foreign affairs and trade. “The task is harder because China increasingly is conducting its diplomacy in a manner it would never accept from others. That diminishes China but is the nature of authoritarian power.” Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, an analyst at the ASPI, wrote in an opinion piece that “Australia must not bow to China but seek wider trade options” and “look to our real friends.” In her article, published by the Sydney Morning Herald on May 21, Xu advised forming a strong alliance with like-minded nations and thinking long-term in reducing reliance on China to better allow Australia to overcome Beijing’s tactics. A survey by Newgate Australia conducted in the third week of May shows that 79 percent of Australians believe the country is responding to the pandemic at an appropriate level and that 67 percent believe the government is doing a “good” or “excellent” job. Despite concerns about the economy and jobs, “Australians continue to have strong faith in the performance and actions of government,” the survey found. Australia’s prime minister in turn has strong faith in his spiritual belief. In a video published in March on the Eternity News website, Morrison says a prayer for his country and people as well as his government colleagues. He prayed for God to “give us strength in this country, give us wisdom, give us judgment, give us encouragement, and let your peace reign.” Morrison has also declared that Australia would never “trade away our values” and would deal with other countries “fairly and honestly and openly,” reported The Guardian in May. “We have always been independent … and we will always stand our ground when it comes to the things that we believe in and the values that we uphold,” he said.

In what is emerging as a second-order effect of recent actions by China related to Australian barley and beef, analysts and traders said fears that orders for unrelated goods could be delayed were beginning to influence behaviour. There are also concerns that threatened consumer boycotts could become a reality. Chinese buyers could shift from Australian dairy products due to fears rising political tensions will get in the way of trade. Eddie Jim ""As far as I know multiple Chinese dairy buyers are shifting their orders to other countries such as Europe or New Zealand. They are terminating some deals with Australian suppliers,"" Song Liang, a Beijing-based dairy analyst, said. ""I would expect a dramatic decrease in Australian dairy exports into China in the second half if the situation does not change.” Over the past week China has communicated a draft decision to hit Australian barley with 80 per cent import tariffs and suspended imports from four Australian abattoirs. China insists there is no link between these actions and the Morrison government's push for a coronavirus inquiry but it seems more inclined to advance than retreat and Australian exporters fear restrictions could be extended to other products. Traders and analysts in China said while there was no directive from the Chinese authorities to cancel Australian orders, that might happen anyway because buyers were worried about supply disruptions or a backlash from consumers if the political spat escalated. ""Although I don't want to reduce my orders, we have to make preparations if the bilateral relationship keeps deteriorating, "" said one beef trader who sells Australian meat in China, who declined to be named. He said he was worried the hostile posturing on both sides could cause Chinese consumers to doubt the quality of Australian meat. ""I’m worried Chinese social media will blow this issue up. Although I don't want to reduce my orders, we have to make preparations if the bilateral relationship keeps deteriorating. In the second half I might have to import more beef from Russia, New Zealand and the United States,"" the trader said. Last month, Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye told The Australian Financial Review there could be a consumer boycott of Australian products due to political tensions over coronavirus. But there is no sign that is happening in China so far. Social media has been relatively quiet on Australia this week and there has been little coverage of the dispute in the Chinese media, apart from the hawkish Global Times. However, traders who spoke to the Financial Review said it was unclear if that would change. Some said they hoped it was a temporary blip that wouldn't affect demand for Australian produce, which remained strong. But they also warned should tensions escalate to a point where there was a backlash from Chinese consumers, they would start cancelling orders. They said they also had to assess the risk of Australian shipments being held up at customs by onerous inspection requirements and red tape because local officials believed the country was out of favour with Beijing. The Australian dairy industry raised concerns about the political tensions with the government this week. Exporters such as The a2 Milk Company have said distribution channels were opening up again in China and demand for Australian products remained high as consumers focused more on health. China has become an increasingly important market for Australian dairy in recent years and now accounts for about one third of all exports. About 12 per cent of all Australian milk ends up in China.

Sign up to the Daily Star's newsletter As military tensions continue to ratchet up in the world, Australia has unveiled its first new military combat aircraft in half a century. The world is in a state of fear with China, North Korea and the US exchanging an increasingly aggressive war of words in the last few months. Now, Australia has launched its own defence with the Loyal Wingman program, developed by Boeing Australia, which is much more than just another combat drone. While current ones are remote-piloted by a controller on the ground, Loyal Wingman flies in support to crewed aircraft, using artificial intelligence to determine its own targets within parameters outlined by the pilot of the lead aircraft. The drone, built by Boeing Australia with a $40 million (£20 million) investment from the federal government, has a unit cost of around $3million (roughly £1,550,000). One of the features that makes Loyal Wingman so cost-effective is its modular design. A detachable nosecone system means that different payloads can quickly be fitted to the basic airframe. The eight-and-a-half foot long Thunderbirds-style modular nose offers around 9,000 cubic inches of space for electric warfare system, advanced infra-red or radar tracking, anti-missile lasers – whatever the mission needs. That way a swarm of Loyal Wingman airframes can be equipped with many capabilities to counter whatever the enemy has in the air. The designers envision giving between four and six of the smart drones to each crewed aircraft. Loyal Wingman represents the first time Boeing has built a grand new combat airframe outside the United States and the first time the RAAF has done so in over fifty years. Australian Minister for Defence Christopher Pyne, speaking at a launch event for the drone, said “This is the first [military] aircraft concept that Australia has invested in since the Boomerang in 1942 to 1945, so it is a red-letter day."" The 11.7 m (38’ 5”) aircraft has a range of around 3,700 km (2,300 miles) While Loyal Wingman is intended to be sold to other air forces around the world, the USAF already has its own next-gen drone – the Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie – which is designed to fulfil a similar function. Both aircraft will vastly multiply the power and effectiveness of a single manned fighter, keeping trained pilots and expensive crewed aircraft out of harms way while providing a wide range of reconnaissance and interdiction capabilities. With China revealing its own deadly new military hardware there will be no shortage of countries in the Pacific region looking for an affordable way to boost the size and effectiveness of their air defences.","AUS","none",0,0,0,0
"205",883,"http://asaa.asn.au/censorship-and-sinology-in-the-era-of-chinese-neo-authoritarianism/","Censorship and Sinology in the Era of Chinese Neo-Authoritarianism - Asian Studies Association of Australia","As China changes, so does Sinology or the study of China. Under President Xi Jinping, China has become more repressive at home and more assertive internationally. These changes are having direct impacts on the Chinese studies community in Australia and beyond, causing scholars to make some difficult decisions about what they say in public, what they choose to study, and how they manage their relationships with colleagues, students, friends and even family members. Similarly, a more authoritarian China brings new pressures to bear on academic institutions that simultaneously seek to uphold academic freedoms while maintaining valued collaborations with Chinese partners. This is not a new problem for the field, but rather one that has become more complex as the geopolitical rivalry between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the West intensifies. Scholars who have had a deep and sustained connection with the PRC have found themselves in a position – for one reason or another – where they needed to modify their words and actions, if only to protect their research participants, colleagues or friends in China from potential harm. Are these acts of self-censorship, tactical decisions or simply cross-cultural courtesies? Kevin Carrico calls out our “moral culpability” and provocatively labels the failure of Sinologists to speak out about ongoing human rights abuses in Xi’s China as “the epitome of narcissistic self-absorption.” American journalist Isaac Stone Fish claims there is “an epidemic of self-censorship” among China scholars, with the PRC’s growing economic and political might curtailing debate and subtly reshaping the research agenda. Others argue the problem is overstated and poorly understood. Based on a survey of over 500 China scholars, Sheena Greitens and Rory Truex conclude “repressive research experiences among China scholars are a rare but real phenomenon,” while also arguing that tackling sensitive topics can sometimes prove beneficial to one’s profile and career. A failed effort to collaborate has embroiled the three of us in this debate. In response to previous speculation and inaccuracies and after weeks of discussion – including frank exchanges over whether we could agree on a collective response – we thought it was important to set the record straight and offer our own reflections on the new challenges confronting Sinologists. The incident, we believe, offers broader lessons for the study of contemporary China, as well as those who study other authoritarian countries in Asia. ———– Following a December 2016 symposium at La Trobe University, the three of us, along with other scholars, developed a journal special issue proposal that we pitched to The China Quarterly in early 2018. Leibold wrote the proposal and the other authors worked individually on their papers in preparation for submitting a final proposal and the articles to the journal. However, before final submission, Erie and Joniak-Lüthi decided to withdraw their papers from the proposed special issue. Erie’s and Joniak-Lüthi’s decisions were motivated by a number of factors, such as the cohesiveness of the special issue and duplication among the papers, the special issue’s impact on the safety of research participants and collaborators, and the chosen venue for publication (a China-focused area studies journal rather than a disciplinary one). As a result of these disagreements, the proposed special issue was abandoned. Still, each of us published our research in other venues: Leibold published his paper on surveillance in Xinjiang in the Journal of Contemporary China in May 2019; Erie published his paper on Islamophobia and sharia in China in the Journal of Law and Religion in April 2019; and Joniak-Lüthi published her article on infrastructure construction and environmental degradation in Xinjiang in Political Geography in December 2019. At no point did any of us suppress the writing of anyone else. Yet the collapse of our collaboration revealed some significant disagreements. At the time, Leibold was upset and frustrated over the wasted time he put into the project, and disappointed by Erie’s and Joniak-Lüthi’s decisions. He dismissed the idea that any negative ramifications would flow from the special issue or their participation in it. He failed, at the time, to understand their perspective. Censorship and repression were forefront in his mind as Cambridge University Press and other academic presses admitted censoring information on their PRC websites, including articles published in The China Quarterly and other leading area studies journals. Evidence was also beginning to emerge of the Chinese Communist Party’s mass extrajudicial internment of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. Leibold believes the Sinology community has an ethical responsibility to probe the darker corners of the Chinese Party-state system and ensure their research findings are made publicly available well beyond narrow disciplinary or even academic outlets. Informed public debate requires a holistic picture of China and its efforts to reshape global norms under Xi Jinping. Yet his situation – tenured academic position, no family in China, reliance on open-source Chinese-language documents and related methodologies – puts him in a position of greater comfort to explore and write about sensitive topics like Xinjiang and Tibet. He must also accept the consequences. An Australian Research Council funded project on the impacts of urbanisation on Tibetan communities in Western China led by Leibold, for example, has elicited significant harassment. Someone claiming to represent the Chinese Embassy in Canberra threatened La Trobe’s Research Office with unspecified consequences if the university proceeded with the project. Colleagues associated with the project in Australia and China were warned to disassociate themselves from the project. Leibold was denied a visa to visit China in October 2018, as was one of his colleagues in 2019. He is subjected to constant online trolling and cyber-attacks. Erie and Joniak-Lüthi, like other junior or pre-tenure scholars, particularly those who conduct long-term ethnographic research, have different strategies as they grapple with trade-offs. Joniak-Lüthi shifted her research temporarily to the other side of the border due to the incarceration and harassment of her Uyghur and Han research collaborators in Xinjiang, and the fact that her presence exposed her research participants to police harassment. Since 2018, east Kyrgyzstan has been her main field site. Erie has experienced surveillance and harassment during fieldwork in China, which has resulted in him prematurely ending fieldwork so as not to endanger interlocutors. As with other scholars who use ethnographic methods, Erie and Joniak-Lüthi have ethical commitments to protect the wellbeing of their interlocutors in the field. These commitments inform all stages of knowledge production, from data gathering and data analysis to write-up and dissemination. Each of these stages requires tactical choices to advance scholarly debate without creating excessive risk, first and foremost for their research participants and collaborators in China to whom they owe a duty of care, and secondarily for themselves. The critical knowledge produced is circulated through various outlets, not only in university teaching and academic publishing, but also through lectures for non-academic audiences and policy consulting. Despite our differences of opinion, we all agree that each scholar needs to navigate this fraught landscape in light of their own situation and relationship to their interlocutors and their disciplines, and thus it is foolish to expect or demand some uniform standard of knowledge production and distribution. Generally, we agree that self-censorship is exercising control over what one says and does to avoid negative repercussions. Beyond this, however, we have different understandings of what this means in practice, and we view these differences as productive and conducive to an engaged debate. ———– Some Sinologists in the West have decided to moderate their language and actions or be far more circumspect as to where and under what circumstances they will speak and publish. For some this is about maintaining access to China for field research, protecting informants, friends and family back in China or being able to closely collaborate with Chinese colleagues and institutions. Motivations vary from complex ethical concerns over the very real possibility that their actions may be used as justification to inflict harm on individuals and communities, to efforts to balance academic and more activist work (whether public or behind the scenes), or simply the desire to remain apolitical and focus on their scholarship. Meanwhile our Han, Uyghur and Tibetan colleagues are in a far more invidious position. Some are PRC citizens or work inside PRC institutions. We know many of them are deeply concerned about the direction China is heading under Xi Jinping and feel frustrated by their inability to speak out publicly. We should not pass judgement on their decisions, especially when we do not fully understand the details of their personal circumstances. There is a range of contributions that scholars can make to our understanding of China which require not only different methods but also different sorts of questions. At the same time, however, we would be foolish to ignore the consequences of censorship and the erosion of academic freedoms on our university campuses. The increased reach and opacity of the Chinese Communist Party means we can never be certain when we will cross the line and become persona non grata. The path from a “China hand” (中国通) to “anti-China force” (反华势力) is a convoluted yet real one. The need to navigate this tightrope does have a chilling and transformative effect on the Chinese studies community, and shapes (often unconsciously) the decisions of individual academics and their institutions. Area studies has long been complicit in the projection of imperial power. Sinology sought to know China in order to transform China—and some now argue Sinology in the West can function as a form of “academic colonialism” (学术殖民) when it comes to the production of knowledge about China. Meanwhile Geremie Barmé continues to espouse the benefits of “New Sinology” (后汉学) in the West, a nuanced and multifaceted understanding of China that is “grounded in an ability to appreciate critically the living past in China’s present.” That means, of course, coming to terms with the messy politics of the PRC’s place in the contemporary world, and the way knowledge and power are co-constituted and ever-shifting in balance. Where there is power, of course, there is also money. Many Western academic institutions and publishing houses profit handsomely from China through the enrolment of students and the making of publication deals, and the desire for new sources of revenue can sometime cloud the judgement of senior executives and erode academic freedoms and autonomy over time. Researchers working on China are constantly making decisions about what they will study and how they will study it, which requires a delicate negotiation with autocracy, surveillance and corporate profiteering. These pressures not only constrain what we know about China but also constrict what people are willing to say about China in public. This is a real problem for the field and requires further discussion and research, but little is to be gained by ad hominem attacks on individual researchers for the decisions they make. China’s authoritarian turn under Xi Jinping is splintering and polarising the Sinology community and social media seems to feed this sense of factionalism. China watchers are making judgements, often unconsciously and without any factual basis, about the politics of colleagues, placing them in binary pro (red) or anti (blue) camps in ways that belie the complexities of the individual situations and favours emotion over evidence. This divide is regrettable and unnecessary. Divisiveness and hostility among China scholars weakens the field, and can play into the hands of those who seek to use our research findings for political and financial gain. Scholars will naturally disagree about these issues and what to do about them, but, minimally, we must find ways to work together and support one another. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of empathy and kindness. Studying China is now more difficult than it was in the past as the Party-state system and its censors grow increasingly sophisticated in their efforts to control the narrative about China and our sources of information on it. Sinology needs to encourage a culture where these new challenges can be openly and robustly discussed without fear of condemnation. The doyen of Chinese studies in the United States, John King Fairbank, was in the habit of stating that a new generation of Sinologists “must stand on the shoulders and faces of the older generations” in order to advance the profession. Fairbank’s salutary kind of face-standing is distinguishable from destructive attacks. As we learned through our failed collaboration, the latter benefits no one, and can actually prevent us from discussing our healthy disagreements.

In a blunt statement and sign of worsening bilateral relations, China imposed anti-subsidy duties totalling 80.5 percent on Australian barley imports. The move, which is expected to impede a billion-dollar trade between the two nations, as per the global thinktank reports. In an emailed statement, a Chinese embassy spokesman said the draft resolution on COVID-19 to be adopted by the World Health Assembly is totally different from Australia's proposal of an independent international review. To claim the WHA's resolution a vindication of Australia's call is nothing but a joke, the statement read. Further, China launched an attack on Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying that he began lobbying international counterparts for an investigation last month, a media report confirmed. In bitter dialogues further, China Ministry’s website wrote in a statement, ""The investigating authority has ruled that there was dumping of imported barley from Australia and the domestic industry suffered substantial damage.” Read: Yemen: Deaths In Aden Increase Five Times Amid Coronavirus Pandemic Read: Queensland Might Not Open Interstate Borders Till September Amid Coronavirus Fears As trade tensions between China and Australia intensify, Australia might challenge the 80 per cent import tariff through the World Trade Organization, as per reports. While downplaying the links between China’s objections and Australia’s vocal about the COVDI-19, Australian government ministers on May 19 told a press conference that there was “no trade war”. However, China accused Australia of a political “maneuver” against Beijing with respect to Covid-19 review as a motion drafted by the European Union and strongly backed by Australia is expected to pass the World Health Assembly (WHA) today, May 19, according to international media reports. Co-sponsored by over 120 countries, the motion calls on the WHO’s director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to initiate an impartial, independent, and comprehensive evaluation into COVID-19. In a press conference held in Sydney, Trade minister Simon Birmingham indicated that Australia will appeal the imposition of a 73.6% anti-dumping tariff and a 6.9% anti-subsidy tariff applied to all Australian barley by China. Further, he was quoted saying that Australia was “deeply disappointed” with China’s decision to impose duties and rejected the basis of the abrupt decision.

Mr Cheng has issued several strident statements regarding Australia’s push for an international investigation into the origins SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as COVID-19. Recently, the Chinese embassy said it was laughable for Australia to feel vindicated after a World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution into the origins of the novel pathogen. “All those who know the consultation process that led to the resolution understand this,” an embassy spokesperson said on Tuesday. “To claim the WHA’s resolution a vindication of Australia’s call is nothing but a joke.” The federal government was the first nation to call for an investigation into COVID-19, a virus that has killed over 320,000 people and ground large swathes of the world economy into a halt. Mr Sharma, a former diplomat to Israel, said the Chinese embassy in Canberra’s stance on the investigation differs to Chinese president Xi Jinping, who endorsed the inquiry. He told Sky News the Ambassador’s interventions “a little strange.” We had President Xi Jinping address the World Health Assembly last night, speaking strongly in favour of such an international investigation, but we have the ambassador here telling us they are opposed to it.” “They seem to be on different pages there,” he said. “Also, frankly, the job of an ambassador is to charm the locals and help communicate their views back to their capital and help them understand it. “I don’t know if this is necessarily the best way to go about charming Australians.” Image: AP Read More Our Apps","AUS","none",0,0,0,0

The new assessment indicates it is more likely that the virus originated in a Chinese market. “It is highly likely it was naturally occurring and that the human infection was from natural human and animal interaction,” an official associated with the Intelligence told CNN. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Five Eyes alliance shares a broad range of intelligence with one another — in one of the world’s tightest multilateral arrangements. Trump and Pompeo, in recent days, have doubled down on the assertion that the outbreak originated from a accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than a market in the same region. Hence, this new assessment now stands to increase pressure on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claim, which it has failed to do so far despite the increasingly aggressive rhetoric. The source said that “clearly the market is where it exploded from,” but how the virus got to the market remains unclear. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Earlier, in an interview with National Geographic, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, had also said he didn’t believe the virus originated in a lab. “This could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” Fauci said, adding that he doesn’t believe that the virus somehow escaped a lab into society. To this end, the US intelligence community issued a statement on Thursday saying it was working to “determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.” The statement said that coronavirus was not manmade or genetically modified. Meanwhile, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalated between Washington and Beijing. China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper said in an editorial that the US had “stunned the world with groundless accusations.” Scientists around the world have also condemned conspiracy theories. China has faced criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the virus, especially during the initial outbreak. It was accused of silencing whistleblowers and delaying informing the public about the severity of the crisis. Critics, however, allege the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to blame China for the global spread of the virus as it faces growing criticism at home for its own handling of the pandemic.

After all, your library will probably be one of the most used rooms in your home. Therefore it’s a good idea to choose the best furniture that you can afford. A great place to start is to look for old and antique pieces that you can restore and put in your study area. It might sound like fun, but don’t let yourself be fooled – it will take some serious restoration work to be able to achieve a high quality library style. The type of furniture you purchase depends on the style you would like. There are many different styles available, including modern and classical. Some people like to have their walls completely decorated in wood in traditional style, while others like to use fabrics, and cotton wall coverings – which nicely complement modern furnishings like electric fireplaces. If you have a dedicated study area, it’s always nice to be able to choose the perfect colors and textures for your walls. Remember to keep in mind the theme you have chosen for your home. If you are interested in using dark woods for your furniture, then this should be applied to your study area as well. Research is the key when it comes to creating a library in your home. This is very important, and it’s something that should not be overlooked. Your research will allow you to know exactly where you want to place certain items. For example, if you are interested in placing furniture in this area that goes with certain books, then you need to research the various titles, authors, and other information about the books you would like to place here. This is very important, and you need to make sure that you do it right. Another important thing to research before building your library is the type of lighting you will need. It is important that you find a suitable location to place your lamps, or lights, so that they don’t create an eyesore. You can even find a lot of unique lamp shades online that will allow you to find the perfect shade for your home. Many people are very proud of their lamp shades, and this is a good thing because it allows them to enhance their home. The library you make at home should be decorated to your liking, but remember to place items that coordinate with your decor. Also, if you plan on placing a television in this area, then make sure that the size and color of the television matches with the decor. Some people are embarrassed to ask for help when they’re planning a home, and if you don’t feel comfortable asking for help, then you might want to reconsider the area you’re planning on placing a television. There are numerous books on how to make a hidden library at your home, and some of them are certainly worth looking into. When you are researching this topic, keep in mind the types of things you are looking to store in this space. Don’t place books on top of each other, as this will cause the books to crease. Also, don’t place several heavy books on one shelf, as this will cause the entire shelf to become unstable. By taking these simple precautions, you will have a wonderful storage area for your books at home. Your email address will not be published.

Australia worries that China will impose tariffs on its exported barley, but it might face much bigger problems than barley if it continues to take unfriendly action against China, experts warned on Sunday. The comments came after Reuters reported that China might increase duties on Australian barley, as bilateral ties between the world's second-biggest economy and one of its biggest suppliers of farm products have been further damaged by Canberra's most recent move on the origins of COVID-19. Relations are the foundation of trade between two countries, and deteriorating ties could result in severe damage to bilateral trade between China and Australia, Jiang Yong, an expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday. On November 19, 2019, China extended for six months an anti-dumping investigation on Australia's exported barley that started on November 19, 2018, and the investigation is due to finish on May 19 this year. This apparently caused Australia's anxiety on potential tariffs. Considering Australia’s reliance on China, the news should weigh on the Australian Dollar (AUD) while also negatively affecting the market’s risk-tone sentiment. As a result, the AUD/USD pair stays pressured around 0.6530 by the press time.  Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The United States remains in first place as the largest source for investment in Australia, followed by Canada, Singapore, Japan, and China in fifth. The annual report, published on May 4, showed a decrease of Chinese investment from $23.7 billion (USD $15.5 billion) in the 2017-18 financial year, to $13.1 billion (USD $8.5 billion) in 2018-19. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg wrote in the report that this continued a four-year downward trend that started in 2015-16. “This can be attributed to a range of factors such as China’s internal domestic policy settings including increased scrutiny of outbound investment and stricter capital controls,” he wrote. Since 2016, the Chinese communist regime has introduced progressively tighter restrictions on how much money Chinese people can send overseas. As a result, Chinese investment globally saw a year-on-year decline of 30 percent during 2017-18, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Overall, Australia saw a lift in the total value of proposed investment applications increasing from $67.9 billion (US$44.4 billion) to $231 billion (USD $151.3 billion). The United States consolidated its top spot with approval values rising from $36.5 billion to $58.2 billion over the past financial year. Much of the increase was attributed to Walt Disney Company’s acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Categories of growth include the services sector ($76 billion), commercial real estate ($73 billion), and manufacturing, electricity, and gas ($36.7 billion). The services sector has seen year-on-year growth since 2015-2016, and includes accommodation providers, communications, construction, and health. David Irvine, Chair of the FIRB, wrote in the report that the board would continue scrutinising foreign investment in sensitive assets such as “critical infrastructure” and assets with “large holdings of personal information.” Irvine highlighted the importance of foreign investment in the rare earth mineral sector, but the investment could not be “contrary to the national interest.” On April 24, the FIRB advised Chinese mining firm Yibin Tianyi that its bid to invest in Perth-based AVZ Minerals would be blocked because it was contrary to the national interest and contrary to the growth of Australia’s rare earth sector. Australia and the United States have been working actively to develop rare earth minerals supplies outside of Chinese ownership. Australia’s focus on national security is reflective of global trends where developed nations, including the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, have all tightened “foreign investment screening on national security grounds.” The report showed that foreign demand for residential real estate has been slowing. In 2017-18, the number of applications was at 10,036 declining to 7,513 in the latest report. The report highlighted several reasons for this decline including foreign investment application fees, stamp duty increases, state taxes, tightening of domestic credit from lenders, and “increased restrictions on capital transfers in home countries.” For Chinese buyers, real estate remained the major channel for investment into Australia, however, there was still a drop from last year going from $12.6 billion to $6 billion this year. Victoria recorded the highest number of approved foreign investment applications at 42 percent, followed by New South Wales and Queensland at 18 percent apiece. Carrie Law, CEO of Juwai.com, an online real estate portal targeting Chinese buyers, told The Australian last year that Melbourne was the most popular city for Chinese buyers and said the dropping Australian dollar made it attractive for foreign buyers. “Chinese buyers make 83 percent more inquiries about acquiring Melbourne property than they do Sydney,” said Law. In 2017, China’s total foreign investment was US$158.29 billion, only behind the United States and Japan, according to the Statistical Bulletin of China’s Outward Foreign Direct Investment, issued by China’s Ministry of Commerce. For years, Chinese conglomerates such as Anbang Insurance and Dalian Wanda Group engaged in major buying sprees across the world. In 2016, Wanda Group made headlines for its purchase of film studio Legendary Entertainment. In Australia, Wanda bought and later sold-off two projects, One Circular Quay in Sydney, and Jewel on the Gold Coast. This widespread buying activity caused China’s foreign exchange reserves to drop dramatically, as most of the funding came from Chinese banks. The Chinese regime responded by clamping down on capital flowing overseas to fund these purchases. This had a flow-on effect across the world, causing real estate prices to drop, notably in international centres popular with Chinese buyers such as New York City, Sydney, and Melbourne.","none","none",0,0,0,0

Goldwind Australia is part of Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co, the world's largest wind turbine manufacturer, based in Beijing. The company shipped medical supplies to China during the coronavirus outbreak and is now expected to be chosen to build two crucial power stations in the NSW Hunter Valley. Daily Mail Australia understands the WaterNSW hydro-electric projects at Glennies Creek and Glenbawn Dam were deemed not profitable enough by the Australian bidders, with shortlisted companies AGL and Meridian dropping out of the race. Glennies Creek Dam is the second hydro-electric project that Goldwind has been shortlisted for, in the NSW Hunter region. Australian firms could not compete, several have dropped out Goldwind is listed on the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges, but 40 per cent of its top ten investors are owned by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Conditions imposed by WaterNSW included that the company with the winning tender would have to hand back the hydro-electric project after 40 years and comply with government directives, such as not using water during drought. This has raised questions about what is motivating the Chinese firm to invest. NSW Labor Senator Deb O'Neill told the Senate on Monday she was 'deeply troubled' by the prospect of a major utility with access to critical NSW energy assets being owned by a company with major ties to a foreign power. She asked how the company could be trusted with energy infrastructure when it had sent much-needed protective equipment to China during the pandemic. 'If they cannot be trusted with medical gloves and masks how can we expect them to act in Australia's interest with our dams and our power grid,' she said. A model shows Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. Ltd. wind farms in China. Goldwind Australia is a part of the giant multinational firm, headquartered in Beijing 'What is even more troubling to me is Goldwind's desire to hide their ties with the ruling Chinese Party.' A decision has not yet been made over the hydroelectric tenders, and any decision will be subject to Foreign Investment Review Board approval. A Goldwind spokesman told The Daily Telegraph the company took steps against the virus in China, Australia and elsewhere, including with 'reciprocal PPE assistance between our teams'. The spokesman said the company had built several projects in Australia that had needed approval from the board, and that it had a clearly defined process. The company has made big inroads into Australia's taxpayer-subsidised green energy sector. Goldwind says on its website that it is now running four wind farms and two solar farms. Chinese firm Goldwind is one of the world's biggest wind turbine generator manufacturers. It has built multiple wind farms in Australia where its turbines are installed It has plans to build four more wind farms and another solar farm. Four other projects are now under construction. Goldwind secured loans from a banking consortium including the ANZ, Westpac and the Commercial Bank of China to install its turbines at the $300 million Cattle Hill wind farm near Lake Echo, Tasmania. The company has a 20 percent stake in Cattle Hill with the other 80 percent owned by PowerChina, which is owned by the Chinese Government. It also has another wind turbine project at Biala where it will install 31 of its turbines in the NSW Southern Tablelands. Glenbawn Dam in the NSW Hunter region has been earmarked by WaterNSW for a hydro-electric project. Pictured: Lake Glenbawn Goldwind is also building the Stockyard Hill wind farm in Victoria, with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews launching the project in June 2018. Said to be Australia's largest wind farm, Stockyard Hill will consist of 149 wind turbines made by the Chinese corporation. The Victorian Premier said at the time it had been made possible 'thanks to the Andrews Labor Government winding back the former Liberal Government's anti-wind farm planning rules that almost killed off the clean energy sector'. Wu Gang, chairman and founder of Xinjiang Goldwind at the Clean Energy Summit in Sydney in 2017. The firm now has four wind farms and two solar farms in Australia. It has plans to build four more wind farms and another solar farm, as well as having four under construction Construction is nearly complete on another Victorian project for Goldwind at the Moorabool Wind Farm near Ballan in central western Victoria, which will install 107 wind turbines made by the Chinese firm. Victoria is the only Australian state to have signed up to the controversial Belt and Road initiative, despite warnings from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and national security agencies. Having signed the initial agreement in 2018, the Andrews Government significantly deepened it with a new agreement in October last year. Critics fear China is using the trillion-dollar Belt and Road, which provides loans and investment in infrastructure projects from the Chinese government, to buy undue influence through debt diplomacy across critical trade choke points around the world.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago Chinese education agents say they will not recommend studying in Australia and have threatened to divert thousands of students to the UK as the sector reels from a dispute between Australia and its largest trading partner. The comments are the first sign that a warning delivered by China's Ministry of Education on Tuesday will trickle down to consumers, as education agents accuse Australia of discriminating against their students and using them as a cash cow. Universities face major losses if Chinese students stop coming to Australia. Credit:Louise Kennerley China is the largest source of overseas students at Australian universities and any decline would put at risk an estimated $3.1 billion of revenue paid by Chinese nationals to the Group of Eight elite research universities alongside RMIT and the University of Technology Sydney. Austlink chairwoman Amy Mo, a Beijing education agent who has operated in the Australian market for 15 years, said the deteriorating relationship would bring ""immeasurable economic losses to Australia"". ""If Australian politicians don't regret and keep being the running-dog of the United States in the name of so-called values, Chinese tourists and students will not go there,"" she said. ""I hope Australia can change its attitude toward China. If a country loves Chinese money but doesn't like Chinese people, China surely is not willing to do business with it."" Ms Mo, who sends 2000 students to Australia a year, said she would consider ""opening up the UK market"" unless relations improved. Chinese students account for about 60 per cent of international enrolments at the Group of Eight overall, including 69 per cent at the University of Sydney, 66 per cent at UNSW, 56 per cent at the University of Melbourne and 57 per cent at Monash University. They make up 37 per cent at RMIT and 53 per cent at UTS. Education agents are responsible for 73 per cent of Chinese student enrolments at Australian education providers. Analysis of enrolment figures and university financial results indicates around 110,000 Chinese enrolments were worth approximately $3.1 billion to these 10 universities in 2018, the bulk of a total $5.4 billion they took in from international student fees. Luke Sheehy, executive director of the Australian Technology Network of universities, including RMIT and UTS, said the sector had prioritised the welfare of students during the COVID-19 crisis and campuses were ""vibrant, safe and welcoming places"". ""International students are an important part of our communities. We look forward to welcoming all students back, including those from China and overseas as soon as possible,"" he said. The sector felt the brunt of coronavirus restrictions early after Australia shut its borders to non-Australian residents travelling from China on February 1. Three years of strained relations between the two countries deteriorated further after Australia called for a global independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in March. China accused Australia of being a puppet advancing US interests in the region and launched two trade strikes on $1 billion worth of beef and barley in April. It followed up this week by warning tourists to reconsider travelling to Australia due to ""an alarming increase"" in racial discrimination and violence during the pandemic. The allegations have been rejected by the Australian government. Ma Yu, an education marketing consultant at Aoji.cn, said the ministry of education's warning would ""definitely bring a huge impact to their willingness to study abroad"". ""Parents are keen on the safety of their children and put safety as priority,"" she said. Salvatore Babones, adjunct scholar at the Centre for Independent Studies and associate professor at the University of Sydney, said the escalation was the latest step in the Chinese government's push to discourage citizens from going overseas to study. ""I think our universities should expect very few new Chinese commencements throughout the 2020s,"" he said, arguing that the Chinese government wanted to get people studying at domestic universities and to prevent capital flight from the country. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said a withdrawal of Chinese students would be a loss to both economies. ""For the long term, it would do nothing to help further the mutual understanding between our two nations,"" he said. The University of Wollongong was the first Australian university to have its ratings outlook cut to negative on Wednesday. Global ratings agency S&P warned its finances could deteriorate if it is unable to mitigate the revenue loss caused by a decline in onshore international student enrolments. S&P reaffirmed the University of Melbourne's stable rating, but warned downward pressure could occur if travel restrictions persist well into 2021. John Manning, the vice president of Moody's Investors Service, said China's recent travel advice for students highlights the vulnerability of Australia's higher education sector to geopolitical tensions between Australia and China. ""Next year, revenues will largely depend on whether coronavirus-related travel restrictions are eased,"" he said. ""In the longer term, with a number of universities ranked among the best in the world, we expect Australia's institutions will remain attractive for international students."" A survey of 400 education agents across 63 countries by education provider Navitas found Australia's successful containment of COVID-19 had made it a more attractive study destination, while the reputations of Britain and the United States have suffered. China's Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned in April that consumers could boycott Australian products including beef, wine, tourism and universities over its pursuit of the inquiry. Of the three sectors hit by Chinese infringements since, wine is the only export yet to be targeted.

Photo: 123RF The Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued the alert, reporting a ""significant increase"" in racist attacks on ""Chinese and Asian people"". The warning comes after China's state-run tabloid Global Times published an editorial that told Chinese students to ""be cautious about studying in Australia"". It did not give any specific examples of such discrimination or violence. ""Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, racial discrimination and violence against Chinese and Asian people in Australia have seen a significant increase,"" the statement said. ""The Ministry of Culture and Tourism reminds Chinese tourists to enhance their safety awareness and do not travel to Australia."" Asians of various backgrounds have said they have been harassed since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, including in the US. China issued a warning to tourists travelling there earlier this year after some said they were mistreated in connection with the outbreak. There have been numerous reports of people of Asian appearance experiencing flagrant racism across Australia in the wake of Covid-19. During the height of the pandemic, the ABC chronicled the stories of Asian Australians who had fallen victim to such attacks. A Chinese-Australian family's Melbourne home was targeted by vandals three times in one week in April. Some of the incidents that happened in public areas were captured on video and shared widely on social media. The travel warning from China could further sour relations between the trade partners. Last month, China announced an 80 percent tariff on Australian barley and blacklisted four major beef exporters due to labelling violations. But Beijing denied the new trade measures were in retaliation to Australia's call for an independent investigation into the global pandemic. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Photo: AFP On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected claims that tightening of overseas investment security tests in Australia was made with China in mind. Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg revealed reforms into foreign investment that would include a stringent security test aimed at protecting critical assets. Morrison denied that the move was targeting China, adding that it should not further sour Australia's relationship with the world's most populous nation. ""I don't believe it should,"" he said. ""Countries make decisions on their own interests for their own rules and we respect the rules and interests of other countries, so I see no reason why that should be the case. ""Australia will always design its foreign investment rules on that basis, as other countries do theirs, so I don't think there is anything extraordinary about that."" The latest developments will put further pressure on cash-strapped Australian universities and colleges, which are reeling in the wake of coronavirus travel restrictions. An international relations expert said restrictions on Chinese citizens travelling to Australia should be a wake-up call for New Zealand. New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre director Jason Young said the diplomatic spat was part of a worrying trend. He said New Zealand's relationship with China is much better than Australia's so it is unlikely to see the same travel alert applied. Dr Young said although borders have not reopened with China yet, the higher education market remains a significant economic driver for New Zealand. That could be put at risk if New Zealand's relationship with China were to deteriorate, he said. But he said racist attacks on Chinese people have occurred here too, and people should be more tolerant. - Reuters / ABC / RNZ Copyright © 2020, Radio New Zealand Australia will suffer its first recession in 29 years, despite the economic fallout from Covid-19 and the bushfires being less dramatic than expected. High-ranking calls to China have gone unanswered amid an escalating trade dispute with Australia that has been fuelled by calls to investigate the origins of Covid-19. New Zealand is part of a coalition of 62 countries backing an Australian push for an investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak in China.

""I would walk in Bathurst cemetery and look out for Chinese graves,"" Dr Kwok said. ""Some of the Chinese were baptised and so they are buried in different sections, such as the Old Church of England section, the Roman Catholic section and the Presbyterian section."" From the 1850s many Chinese men initially came out to try their luck for gold, but Dr Kwok said many others arrived to work in food production and often married women of European backgrounds. Dr Kwok said many Chinese men from the Central West region of New South Wales were trailblazers in vegetable growing. ""Many Chinese became successful commercial market gardeners, sending their produce in large quantities to Haymarket,"" she said. ""They also brought technology for raising water, pumping water from the rivers which made it possible for them to irrigate the land, and they brought that technology from their villages via the goldfields. ""Around the end of the 19th century, they were the ones who pioneered vegetable growing in rural NSW. ""They really laid the foundations for European farmers to follow in their footsteps."" The Chinese farmers' success in growing vegetables was to the ire of others who were often unsuccessful in local agricultural show judging awards. A review of the 1886 Bathurst Exhibition, published in the Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal, acknowledged the success of Chinese entrants: ""Australian gardeners, what, are you about to let John Chinaman lick you in vegetables? Is the vegetable kingdom to pass wholly over to the Chinese?"" Dr Kwok said there were challenges in tracking down descendants of early Chinese immigrants, in particular women who changed their surnames when they married. ""There were other cases where people changed their names in order to fit into society so that their children wouldn't be discriminated against,"" she said. ""Chinese people were looked down on in society as Australia went into a long period of White Australia. ""There was so much legislative discrimination against Chinese people that parents of children probably thought it was better for their children's future if they were disassociated from their Chinese heritage."" Dr Kwok said it was rewarding to meet descendants who were aware of their family backgrounds. ""It's been really exciting meeting with people who are really proud of their Chinese heritage and to rediscover their Chinese roots,"" she said. Dawn Brownlow's grandfather arrived in Australia during the turn of the 20th century and was a market gardener in the White Rock and Brewongle areas. Her Australian-born father, Charles Yow Jr, worked as a postal department worker and would also help his brother, Reginald, at his market garden in Bathurst. The men were all buried at the local cemetery where their gravesites remain today. With their mother, Ellen nee Schofield, who was raised with Irish Catholic traditions, Ms Brownlow and her seven siblings grew up in a household with a mix of cultural traditions. Family meals would include stir fries with rice throughout the week with steamed fish on Fridays. ""My mother recounted stories of how fantastic it was to come to a Chinese funeral because they would cook a whole pork and you got a penny and you got lollies,"" Ms Brownlow said. In 1939, during WWII, Charles Yow Jr enlisted in the army and served throughout the Middle East, the Mediterranean and the Pacific, Ms Brownlow said. ""He was an expert in dismantling machine guns and putting them back together,"" she said. ""My dad is an Australian-born Chinese who fought for this country. ""He had shrapnel in his back till the day he died."" Charles Yow Sr was a member of the Bathurst Chinese Masonic Lodge, a mutual aid society run out of a town building established in 1921 and demolished in 1953. Today, Ms Brownlow wears a pendant made from her late grandfather's lodge membership badge. The heirloom is a reminder of her ancestors and their contribution in the early development of regional Australia. ""I'm extremely proud, I would shout it from the top of The Carillon,"" she said.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.) believes Australia should join America and the UK in a new Cold War against China. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald from Washington on June 9, Scott said America, Australia, and their allies must unite against communist China’s goal of world domination. “We ought to do this together. All democracies are going to have to say to themselves: are they going to continue to appease the Communist Party of China, which is clearly focused on world domination and has taken jobs from democracies all over the world and stolen technologies from all over the world?” said Scott. Scott remarked that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) does not believe in human rights or free and fair trade. “They don’t want to be a caring world citizen. They’re willing to take away people’s rights. I’m disgusted with how they treated Uighurs and how they treated Hong Kong citizens,” said Scott. The former governor of Florida, Scott is one of the U.S. Congress’s most outspoken politicians on the CCP. Currently, he sits on the U.S. government sub-committee for Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the sub-committee for the Armed Forces, among others. Scott has previously called for Americans to boycott goods made in China, urged the cancellation of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, and accused China of trying to “sabotage” or slow down the United State’s efforts to create a vaccine for the CCP virus, commonly known as novel coronavirus. Analysts have discussed the development of a new Cold War between America and China since 2018. Australian international relations expert Alan Dupont argued that a cold war between the United States and China is now a reality as both countries have gone from “a framework of cooperation to one of open rivalry and strategic competition.” Writing in a paper (pdf) for the Centre for Independent Studies in May, Dupont said China and the United States are now “wrestling for strategic advantage in an increasingly bitter contest to determine which of them will be the pre-eminent state of the 21st century.” Dupont believes that this cold war will be different from the previous one between the United States and the Soviet Union because China is more integrated into the global economy. However, Dupont wrote: “It’s conceivable that the world could divide into two competing trade and geopolitical blocs, much like the Cold War, except that the bifurcation would be more fluid and fragmented.” The first Cold War divided the world into two competing sides separated economically and politically. The communist Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe and Central Asia, as well as supporting China, Cuba, North Korea, and Mongolia. America was supported by Western Europe, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, to name a few. Sen. Scott wrote on Twitter on June 9 that in the “New Cold War” every democracy needs to show real accountability by standing up to the Chinese Communist Party. We know Communist China is our adversary, violates human rights, & wants to be the sole global power. Real accountability will come when every democracy stands up to Communist China.
