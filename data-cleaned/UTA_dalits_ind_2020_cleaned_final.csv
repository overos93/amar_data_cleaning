A panel of doctors at the Ahmedabad civil hospital on Wednesday, January 8, conducted the postmortem after the cops lodged a case of kidnapping, gangrape and murder against four persons. According to the report in The Hindu, the four accused had allegedly kidnapped the victim, gang-raped her before murdering her. After killing the victim, the accused hanged the body from the tree to make it look like suicide. The 19-year-old girl had gone missing on December 31, 2019, after which her family approached the police on January 3 to lodge an FIR but the local police refused. According to the report, local police inspector NL Rabri told the family that the girl was safe and had eloped with a boy of the same community and both had got married, so no case was required to be lodged. On 5 January, the victimтАЩs body was found hanging from the tree. The Family members of the victim refused to accept the body, claiming that it was a murder and not a suicide. The police registered an FIR on Tuesday тАФ against Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Satish Bharvad and Jigar in the case. The family agreed to claim the body after registration of the FIR, after which body was sent for postmortem at the Ahmedabad civil hospital. The case was registered under various provisions and sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after thousands of Dalits protested in front of the local police station.

Modasa Rural police have registered a case of accidental death and investigations are under way. A family member of the deceased said that the girl, a graduate, had a beauty parlour. тАЬShe left home on January 1. After she didnтАЩt return home the next day, her father had given a complaint to Modasa Town police where he had named a suspect for the mysterious disappearance of his daughter. However, (Modasa Town) the police did not register an offence and told the father that the case falls under the jurisdiction of Modasa Rural police. On Sunday morning, the womanтАЩs body was found hanging from a tree in the neighbouring village,тАЭ said the family member. The person also alleged that the Modasa Town police did not register the case as the suspect and the police inspector are from the same community. тАЬWe donтАЩt know if she was kidnapped. But it is a fact that her body was found hanging from a tree,тАЭ the relative said. Aravalli Superintendent of Police Mayur Patil said, тАЬThe woman went missing on January 1. Her family members searched for her for two days and then gave a complaint to Modasa Town police on January 3. Following the complaint, Modasa town police recorded various statements based on which her last appearance was found in this village (where the body was found). Modasa Town police then transferred the case to Modasa Rural police. And while they were investigating the case, the girlтАЩs body was found on Sunday.тАЭ Patil said that police did not take any coercive action against the person named as suspect by the father of the woman because there was not enough evidence to do so. Inspector General of Police (Gandhinagar range under which Aravalli district falls) Mayanksinh Chavda said, тАЬWe have registered a case of accidental death. Investigations are on to ascertain various facts of the case including the cause of death.тАЭ ЁЯУг The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

That he wanted to voice his disapproval of the CAA and the NRC is well known. In fact, his first action on being released from Tihar Jail a few days ago was to return to Jama Masjid and vent his anger against the CAA and the NRC, which he described as kaley kanoon or black laws. Azad does not mince words and is willing to hit out against the Modi government. Says he: тАЬThe Jama Masjid is a place of great historicity. At the time of the partition of the country, Maulana Azad had stood here and appealed to the Muslims that they should not move to Pakistan as such a move would prove inimical to their interests. Once again, there is a move by the present government to divide the country along religious lines. I come from a village. We are all aware that the CAA and NRC will cause untold sufferings to the poor while the political class will remain unaffected. It was an imperative for me to raise my voice against such a move.тАЭ But the government claims that AzadтАЩs presence at Jamia Masjid in December led to a heightening of tensions, so much so that it left several protestors injured at Delhi Gate. Azad insists such a criticism was false because when he was there last month, he had a copy of the Indian Constitution with him. He had only read out its Preamble to the enthused crowds. тАЬI did the same when I went back to Jamia Masjid,тАЭ he says. тАЬI read out the Preamble of our Constitution. It is the duty of every citizen to protect it. With the present government trying to divide the nation on the basis of religion, this amounts to nothing less than weakening our Constitution which is respected around the world and is looked upon as a unique document.тАЭ Had Ambedkar not authored the remarkable Constitution, Azad says, then Dalits such as myself and lakhs of people belonging to the oppressed communities would have continued to be subjected to humiliation on a daily basis, he says. Azad speaks with passion and that is one of the main reasons for his appeal amongst the youth. He also does not hesitate to take a snipe at prime minister Modi, which is why the BJP has little love lost for him. Now, the court has asked him to speak respectfully of Modi. Azad told me that he тАЬagrees with thatтАЭ and then he quips, тАЬShri Shri Modiji occupies a constitutional position but I would also request him to respect the Constitution instead of weakening the foundations of our country. I would not have opposed the CAA if he had included Tamils and Muslims rather than differentiating refugees on the basis of their faiths.тАЭ Azad says he emulates his hero, the revolutionary freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad. He has, of course, combined his trademark moustache with a blue scarf. He is all praise for the thousands of women who have been sitting day and night in the cold weather protesting against CAA-NRC but is unhappy over students, especially women, being beaten up in Jamia Milia Islamia and at JNU. тАЬIt is very sad....thereafter, students were beaten up in JNU, AMU, DU and other universities. I am very proud of the way hundreds of our sisters along with their children have been sitting there for over a month. But if prime minister cannot hear their voices, how will he hear the voices of crores of people living in the villages?тАЭ he says. What has really alarmed Azad is the statement of RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat on Friday that there was no question of backing out from the CAA. тАЬIt is alarming that this statement came not from the PM or the home minister but from the RSS. It just shows that the RSS is the BJP and the BJP is the RSS. We all know their agenda is to establish a Hindu Rashtra. The RSS has never accepted our Constitution and that is why they are jailing people for reading the Constitution. But opposition to these laws will not cease. We will fight and get these laws repealed even if this involves going to jail a thousand times,тАЭ he says, with bravado. Azad was jailed in 2017, in an environment of growing atrocities against the Dalits. The Dalits, at the same time, have emerged as an important vote bank. Was the present regime worried that AzadтАЩs appeal amongst the Dalits was growing. Could this be one reason why he is being jailed frequently? тАЬMaybe,тАЭ Azad says, тАЬI am being stopped from entering Delhi because I am a Dalit.тАЭ In his view, anyone who opposes the government is dubbed an anti-national, but it is the opposition parties who keep alive the spirit of democracy. тАЬThe BJP believes that the more muddied the politics of this country will become, the more the lotus will bloom,тАЭ he says. Azad also clarifies that he has no plans to enter the electoral fray at present. тАЬWe had thought of contesting elections but a decision has been postponed. Fighting the CAA-NRC is a much more crucial battle. I want to meet the protestors who have been jailed in UP. It is important to remove their fear and to build up a sense of solidarity across the country,тАЭ he says, adding, тАЬI am ready to be led by anyone who has raised the gauntlet against the government.тАЭ тАЬThere is no court bigger than the peopleтАЩs court and why should the prime minister presume that he is larger than the Constitution,тАЭ he says. Agreed, no political party is leading this protest. Rather, it is being led by the people. тАЬThe country is going through a very crucial juncture,тАЭ Azad says. тАЬIf we do not speak up now, we will not be able to go back.тАЭ  The author is a freelance journalist. The views are personal.","IND","dalit",1,1,1,4

The police and party workers scuffle broke out in UP territory when cops tried to prevent him from moving on from the Greater Noida area on Thursday afternoon. He was accompanied by his sister Priyanka Gandhi and a large number of party leaders, and workers. The group was trying to make their way to reach Hathras and meet the grieving Dalit family whose daughter was raped, murdered, killed by 'upper-caste' men, and then her body hastily cremated by the local administration.

According to a report in the India Today, Rahul Gandhi was pushed to the ground by the police personnel. The Uttar Pradesh Police stopped them at the Yamuna Expressway, citing imposition of Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people. However the visuals show how the police themselves charged at the unarmed crowds.

Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize It wasnтАЩt Subhash Chandra Bose alone who turned down the Indian Civil Service. Jaipal Singh Munda did, too, and went on to become the voice of the Adivasis in the Constituent Assembly, where he spoke up against casteism and patriarchy in mainstream Indian society. A. K. Biswas looks back at his life. There are few icons of the tribal heartland who are given the importance they deserve in Indian history. They are not only segregated, but also excluded. The Tribals themselves were exploited and cheated unmercifully by the outsiders. This went on unhindered, on a savage scale, for centuries. No wonder, Tribals are suspicious of the non-Tribals тАУ their immoral motives and dark intentions. The Santhals rose in revolt in 1855. A section of society tries to project their revolt as an uprising against the British rule. But the Santhals revolt was actually directed against outsiders in general, who, in their language, were called dikus тАУ cheats, exploiters and extortionists. Birsa Munda-led rebellion or тАЬUlgulanтАЭ, meaning тАЬGreat TumultтАЭ (1899-1900), which took place in the south of Ranchi, was a landmark in the agrarian history of tribal India. It was against encroachment and dispossession of tribal land. It was a manifestation of the consequent frustration and anger among the deprived tribal communities. The Mundas traditionally enjoyed a preferential rent rate as the тАЬkhuntkattidarтАЭ or the original clearer of the forest. But during the 19th century, they had seen the тАЬkhuntkattiтАЭ land system being eroded by the тАЬjagirdarsтАЭ and тАЬthikadarsтАЭ тАУ the outsiders who arrived as merchants and moneylenders and gradually invaded their paradise in the forests. Birsa Munda was born in the Khunti subdivision of Ranchi district on 15 November 1875. He lived little less than 25 years, breathing his last on 9 June 1900 in prison. His short life left a deep imprint on the tribal communities. Jaipal Singh Munda was born three years after Birsa MundaтАЩs death. Jaipal too belonged to the Khunti subdivision of Ranchi district (Khunti is now a district carved out of Ranchi in Jharkhand). Jaipal was born on 3 January 1903 in Tapkara, a Munda village. BirsaтАЩs struggle had carved out a permanent space in history for Jaipal. JaipalтАЩs family had embraced Christianity. Missionaries of the SPG Mission, Church of England, had noticed early sparks of his talent and leadership qualities. After initial schooling in his village, Jaipal was admitted to St PaulтАЩs School, Ranchi, run by the missionaries. His amiable character and qualities enamoured all those who came in touch with him. Early in his youth, his exceptional calibre as a hockey player shone. Jaipal Singh Munda The principal of St PaulтАЩs became his patron and sent him to Oxford University, England, for higher education. Jaipal did not take much time to demonstrate his mettle as an ace hockey player in the celebrated university and was soon part of the Oxford University hockey team. The hallmarks of his game as a deep defender were his clean tackling, sensible game-play and well-directed hard hits. He was the most versatile player in the Oxford University hockey team. His contribution to the university hockey team earned him recognition and he became the first Indian student to be conferred the Oxford Blue in Hockey. At Oxford, JaipalтАЩs literary talents exploded as a prolific sports тАУ particularly hockey тАУ columnist. He regularly contributed to leading British journals and his articles were widely acclaimed by readers. In 1928, the Netherlands hosted the Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Jaipal was chosen to captain the Indian hockey team for this event. But he had a choice to make: either turn down the offer to play for India or face expulsion from the prestigious Indian Civil Service. Jaipal passed his Economics (Honours) examinations with flying colours. He then took the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examinations conducted by the British in India for bureaucracy aspirants. Those Indians who had qualified before him hailed from rich, land-owning aristocratic families. Jaipal was a striking exception. He entered the ICS with the highest marks in the interview. It was while he was undergoing training in England as a probationer that he got the call-up to represent India in the Amsterdam Summer Olympics. He was asked to travel to Amsterdam and join the team immediately. Jaipal approached the authorities at the India Office, London, seeking leave of absence so that he could proceed to Amsterdam. The India Office rejected his application outright. Indian hockey team in the 1928 Olympics after their first match versus Austria. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) He was in a dilemma тАУ whether to play for the country or hold on to the straitjacketed ICS тАУ and he picked the former. Subhash Chandra Bose has said that nobody from India had, before him, voluntarily foregone an opportunity for a career in the ICS which held in store great opportunities, social recognition, unprecedented dignity, a secure life and unquestioned authority with the British at the helm of power. Sadly, Subhash Chandra Bose had erred in overlooking this sacrifice of Jaipal Singh Munda. Jaipal responded to the dictates of his heart and defied the established conformism. He left for Amsterdam fully aware of the consequence тАУ for he stood virtually dismissed. Such indiscipline on the part of any probationer is not tolerated, much less so by the India Office at the time, which remote-controlled the Government of India from London. Indeed, such brazen defiance by a probationer was considered unbecoming of a budding ICS. The Indian hockey team for Amsterdam Olympics was announced: Jaipal Singh (Captain), Richard Allen, Dhyan Chand, Maurice Gateley, William Good-Cullen, Leslie Hammond, Feroze Khan, George Marthins, Rex Norris, Broome Pinniger (vice-captain), Michael Rocque, Frederic Seaman, Ali Shaukat and Sayed Yusuf. The league stage of the tournament involved two groups, A and B. In all, 31 players scored 69 goals in 18 matches. Of them, India (from group A) scored 29 goals тАУ Dhyan Chand scored 14; Feroze Khan and George Martins scored five each; Frederic Seaman, three; and Ali Saukat and Maurice Gateley, one each. India defeated Holland 3-0 in the final. Germany and Belgium had to be content with the third and fourth positions, respectively. Jaipal did not play the final against Holland. Serious differences had cropped up between team manager A.B. Rossier and the captain. Jaipal had gracefully opted out of the final match. Vice-Captain Broome Pinniger stewarded the team to a convincing victory over Holland. This was IndiaтАЩs first ever Olympics gold. Jaipal returned to England after the 1928 Olympics. Then Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, personally congratulated him for his excellent captaincy and the teamтАЩs performance and victory. The India Office appeared to have softened their stance on the ICS. Perhaps prodded by Irwin, Jaipal was asked to rejoin the ICS probation, which, however, was extended by a year. He felt humiliated by the decision to extend his probation. He found it discriminatory and unacceptable and consciously defied the orders of the India Office a second time. He returned to India and joined a multinational oil major, Burmah Shell, which had offered him the position of a senior executive while he was still in England. In metropolitan Calcutta, where he was based, Jaipal met his future wife, Tara Winfred Majumdar. She was the granddaughter of Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee, one of the founders of the Indian National Congress and its first president (1885). Their marriage, however, did not last long. Teaching assignments took Jaipal to different places тАУ from Raipur (the present capital of Chhattisgarh) in the Central Provinces and Berar, to the Gold Coast in Ghana, Africa, and finally, to Rajputana. In Raipur, he became the principal of Rajkumar College. Here, he became the target of caste hatred and discrimination, despite his outstanding educational qualifications; accomplishments, including those in sports; competence; and leadership qualities. Rajkumar College was the exclusive preserve and grooming ground of young men from Indian princely and feudal families in the company of European students. The parents found it unpalatable and galling to have their children educated under a Tribal. The Europeans too were uncomfortable. So, Jaipal proceeded to the Gold Coast, Africa, again on a teaching assignment. Gradually, his career changed tracks. When he returned to India, he was appointed Colonization Minister and Revenue Commissioner in the princely state of Bikaner. This stint, in which he was unimpeachable, earned him further laurels. He was elevated to the post of Foreign Secretary of the state of Bikaner. Jaipal Singh Munda sketch (Source: Adivasi Resurgence) At this stage, he felt a profound urge to do something for his people, the neglected and exploited tribal communities in Chota Nagpur in Bihar. He returned to Bihar and met Dr Rajendra Prasad, president of the Bihar Provincial Congress Committee, at Sadaquat Ashram in Patna. There, he felt, he was accorded a cold reception. If one door closes before a determined person, with his belief in himself and strength, another opens up simultaneously. The proverbial door opened for Jaipal, too. The Governor of Bihar and Orissa, Sir Maurice Hallet, who requested him to become a member of the Bihar & Orissa Legislative Council, opened the door. He, however, politely declined the gracious offer. Then, both the Governor and Robert Russell, the chief secretary, advised him to take up the cause of the tribal people who were already in a restive mood. Jaipal Singh went to Ranchi, where Tribals gave him a warm and tumultuous welcome. In 1946, Jaipal was elected to the Constituent Assembly from a general constituency in Bihar. The 296-member Constituent Assembly was tasked with drafting the Constitution. Jaipal spoke for the first time in the Assembly on 19 December 1946. Introducing himself as a тАЬjungliтАЭ тАУ a forest dweller тАУ he spoke of the тАЬunknown hordes тАУ of unrecognized warriors of freedom, the original people of India who have variously been known as backward tribes, primitive tribes, criminal tribes and everything else. Sir, I am proud to be a jungli тАУ that is the name by which we are known in my part of the country.тАЭ Speaking for the people living in the Chota Nagpur plateau, he supported the resolution that articulated the aspiration and sentiments of тАЬmore than 30 millions of the AdibasisтАЭ (amid cheers), because it was also тАЬa resolution which gives expression to sentiments that throb in every heart in this countryтАЭтАж He added, тАЬAs a jungli, as an Adibasi, my common sense tells me, the common sense of my people tells me, that every one of us should march in that road of freedom and fight together.тАЭ At the time, the newly independent country was brimming with emotion and idealism. However, about seven decades on, we have a deep sense of disillusionment. A tragedy has befallen the country and the masses have become the collective victims of a section of greedy, manipulative and unprincipled leaders who are intrinsically entrenched and involved in unbridled loot, unchecked corruption and blatant exploitation for Jaipal Singh Munda captained this Indian hockey team that won the Gold in the 1928 Olympics held in Amsterdam, Holland self-aggrandizement.  Jaipal Singh did not mince words to ventilate the grievances of his тАЬprimitive peopleтАЭ who, according to him, were тАЬshabbily treated тАж They have been disgracefully treated, neglected for the last 6,000 years.тАЭ When and how did it began? Who were the men guilty of disgracing and neglecting the tribal people? Jaipal Singh Munda told the assembly: тАЬThe history of the Indus Valley Civilization, a child of which I am, shows quite clearly that it is the newcomers тАУ most of you here are intruders as far as I am concerned тАУ it is the newcomers who have driven away my people from the Indus Valley to the jungle.тАЭ This was the severest indictment possible of the тАЬhonourable menтАЭ comprising the newly elected Constituent Assembly. They were extremely accomplished men and women, elected from all parts of the country. If the historians have not placed this statement in Indian historiography, it only indicates their failure. It underlines that they had no courage to do so, and deep bias and prejudice dominated their writing and re-writing of history. Jaipal was telling his peers about the invasion that led to the damage and destruction of the Indus Valley, which boasted of a glorious civilization. He said that the people living in the Indus Valley were driven to remote, inhospitable forests and mountains. Indeed, to declare it among the honourable members of the Constituent Assembly that they were guilty of this relentless brutality was tantamount to their public condemnation. The miserable fate of his people led him to bemoan that, тАЬthe whole history of my people is one of continuous exploitation and dispossession by the non-aboriginals of India punctuated by rebellions and disorderтАЭ. It may be stated that 292 members of the Constituent Assembly were elected through the provincial legislative assemblies; besides, there were 93 members who represented the Indian princely states, and four members who represented the Chief CommissionersтАЩ Provinces. They sat in silence and listened to Jaipal as he waxed eloquent on an alternate history of India. Some of them included mass leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, C. Rajagopalachari, Sarojini Naidu, J.B. Kripalani and Dr Sachchidanand Sinha. The maharajas of Patiala, Bikaner and Gwalior and the Nawab of Bhopal, too, heard his speech with rapt attention. The apathy and negligence of the Cabinet Mission with respect to the tribal people of India came up for sharp criticism in his speech. тАЬHave we not been casually treated by the Cabinet Mission [and have not] more than 30 million people [been] completely ignored?тАЭ Representing these 30 million, he bemoaned, there are only тАЬsix tribal members in this Constituent AssemblyтАЭ. Jaipal noted that the tribal communities are a living example of an egalitarian society. He said, тАЬThere is no question of caste in my society. We are all equal.тАЭ Their unabated exploitation, he said, exhibited the dominant paradigm of the social-economic and political culture. He strongly demanded the inclusion of тАЬmore AdibasisтАЭ in the national legislature to represent their interests. A firm believer in gender equality among the tribal communities, he said, тАЬI mean, sir, not only (Adibasi) men but women also. There are too many men in the Constituent Assembly. We want more women тАжтАЭ Jaipal Singh was definitely one of the first to press for the participation of women in shaping and building independent India. In a stirring speech, Jaipal Singh told the Constituent Assembly, тАЬYou cannot teach democracy to the tribal people; you have to learn democratic ways from them. They are the most democratic people on earth.тАЭ This country should be proud of the tradition of democracy prevalent and practised by the tribal communities тАУ free from inequality, discrimination and disadvantages imposed on one section by another without any reason and logic. тАЬWhat my people require, sir, is not adequate safeguards тАж they require protection from the ministers. That is the position today. We do not ask for any special protection. We want to be treated like every other Indian,тАЭ he said. On the issue of freedom and rights under Article 13 (1) (b), namely, to тАЬassemble peaceably and without armsтАЭ, he pointed out тАЬthat this matter of the Arms Act has been very mischievously applied against the Adibasis. Certain political parties have gone to extremes to point out that because Adibasis carry bows and arrows, lathis or axes, which they do daily as a normal part of their life, which they have done for generations and generations, and what they are doing today they have done before, that they are preparing for trouble.тАЭ He cited the example of the Oraon tribe. тАЬWe have in this Assembly only one Oraon member. Now, the Oraon group of Adibasis constitutes the fourth largest block of Adibasis in India.тАЭ Jaipal Singh highlighted the cultural traditions of the Oraons. тАЬThey have, what we call, тАШjatrasтАЩ or тАШmelasтАЩ. These are annual occasions for their cultural activities. They have a certain ceremony in which the head of the Oraon village will carry the flag and the rest of them will carry lathis with them and proceed into the various тАШakhadasтАЩ or villages. It is a festival for the people; they have done it in a harmless way for generations and generations, and, now we have been told last year and the year before last, that we should not carry weapons. I do not mind pointing out there are several members here from Bihar who will never be able to get back to their homes unless they are escorted with people and with arms. In my own part, we live in the jungles and everyone, even women, may I point out, carry what might be designated arms, but they are not arms in that sense. Whenever we have to hold meetings, if people come with their own usual things, I want to know whether it is going to be interpreted that we are assembling non-peacefully and carrying arms for an unlawful purpose. These are the only points, sir, that I want to be clarified. тАЬI will give one more instance. Every seven years, it is the custom in Chota Nagpur to have what they call тАШEra SendraтАЩ тАУ тАШJanishikarтАЩ. Every seven years, the women dress as men and hunt in the jungles тАУ dressed as men, mind you. That is the occasion, when, naturally, women like to show masculine prowess. They arm themselves like men with bows and arrows, lathis, bhelas and so forth. Now, sir, according to this particular Article in the Constitution, the government might interpret that women, every seven years, have been getting together for a dangerous purpose. I urge the House to do nothing that is going to upset the simple folk. They have been among the most peaceful citizens in our country and we should be very very cautious in doing anything which might be misunderstood by them and lead to trouble.тАЭ Jaipal Singh added: тАЬI have been traversing a lot among the Adibasis in the Adibasi tracts, and, in the last 9 years, I have traversed 1,14,000 miles, and it has given me an idea of what the Adibasis need and what this House is expected to do for them. He urged that the interests and cultural traits of Tribals needed protection and care.тАЭ Jaipal thus was a man of many parts тАУ an accomplished writer, a hockey wizard, an excellent orator, a visionary, an uncommon patriot and an indefatigable champion of the Adivasi cause. Jaipal stands out among current and past sports personalities with his integrity, patriotism and courage тАУ qualities that would propel him towards becoming Marang Gomke, the great leader of the tribal people.

A+| A| A- Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde, Gurugram: Penguin Random House India, 2019; pp 325, тВ╣ 599. While you may dismiss Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde as another rant on caste, it sizzles and draws the line with a renewed focus on Brahminism as the ideology that governs IndiaтАЩs public life, the core weaknesses of the Dalit movement, and the kind of radical action caste-embedded marginality calls for. The work builds on the experiences of the author as a DalitтАФfrom an urban fringe in Nanded, Maharashtra to a young academic at Harvard Kennedy SchoolтАФhis encounters with people drawn from diverse backgrounds in several countries, and the kind of reactions that caste invoked in them. Calling attention to the тАЬhuman degradationтАЭ that caste subscribes to, its тАЬviolent and toxic ethos,тАЭ тАЬdeep hatred of the other,тАЭ the kind of terror it unleashes on тАЬlesserтАЭ and тАЬdefamed bodies,тАЭ its тАЬbrutal chronicles from the pastтАЭ and the тАЬcontinuing experiences of humiliation and stigma in the present,тАЭ the study intends to set up a public conversation on caste. Critical of the тАЬDalit hope of a constitutional state,тАЭ it seeks to catalyse тАЬa new idiom for transformation.тАЭ It challenges the beguiling slogans of development and welfarism and argues that the priority should be тАЬto end and annihilate the echo chamber of oppressionтАЭ (p 33). He thinks that Dalits have their тАЬHarlem momentтАЭ today, in the wake of new technologies of communication and expressions of freedom. A specific methodology informs the text throughout: The author sets aside complex processes of adducing evidence, while backing his observations and judgments through illustrations. It does enable him to reach out to a wider public. Troubles of Dalit Movement The book highlights the continuing dominance of the upper castes, the mote lok, in the Indian body polity, and the persisting marginality and subhuman treatment meted out to Dalits: While the economic system of feudalism has been gradually replaced with a mixed modern-day model of capitalism and state socialism, the social aspect of feudalism is as entrenched as ever. (p 27) The constitutional frame has limited reach to the oppressed, but тАЬmany Dalits are repeating the stateтАЩs narrative of constitutionalism as being the ultimate virtueтАЭ (p 76). In the face of social sanction, law remains a mute witness. The constitutional mask placed on B R Ambedkar lets the state to play identity politics, scuttling Dalit radicalism. Schemes, such as reservation, have led to fights for crumbs. The political regime in place asks Dalits to prove their patriotic credentials, while denouncing their struggles for their rights. Dalits often speak of organisational unity, but are split into umpteen groups beholden to self-serving leaders. There are the тАЬToken DalitsтАЭ who consider themselves integral to Hindu culture and sell themselves to the highest bidder. It includes тАЬConservative DalitsтАЭ who diligently practise the caste chores passed on to them as untouchables and тАЬReactive DalitsтАЭ who have no convictions of their own and make their presence felt by reacting to the position of others. There are the тАЬElite DalitsтАЭ consisting of salaried hypocrites, and third generation Dalits. While the salaried Dalits shun fellow Dalits and imitate their non-Dalit peers, the third generation Dalits are тАЬclass-sensitive and caste-blind.тАЭ The millennials among the latter are technologically savvy and end up тАЬemulating Hindu practices in their households.тАЭ There are the тАЬSelf-obsessed DalitsтАЭ who use the social capital of the community, but having succeeded, use Brahminical language to denigrate their community members. They are harmful as they claim to speak for Dalits. In all, тАЬprivileged Dalits effectively execute caste codes upon the lower social, economic and political sub caste Dalit groupsтАЭ (p 98). There is also a lack of social endosmosis among Dalit castes. It all helps the Brahminical ideology to thrive. Brahminical order weighs heavy on Dalit females as тАЬcaste, religion, patriarchy, class and spatialityтАЭ overlap in their marginality. The critical sections are the тАЬRadical Dalits,тАЭ found in any class or sub-caste of Dalits, who are proud of their caste and Dalitness and are committed to their struggle. They make offences against Dalits public, challenge Brahminical discourse, and reach out to all oppressed persons. The book points out that Dalit intellectuals run an entire spectrum of thinking today: Caste radicals, pragmatic Dalits, Ambedkarites and Marxists. While a spiritual canon is constructed with Ambedkar as the centre, Dalit spiritual life continues to be extremely diverse. Even those who have embraced Buddhism after Ambedkar read it in different ways. There is clearly a process of nationalisation of Dalits to subserve the interests of neo-liberalism in India. The author refers to the much talked about phenomenon of Dalit capitalism patronised by the state and institutionalised in the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There is a parallel for the same in the initiative of Booker T Washington who set up capitalist enterprises for Blacks in the United States. The author, however, feels that such an initiative is not compatible with the marginality of Dalits in India, their considered views on the question, and the social nature of capital in India. Dalit capitalism is a new mode of тАЬBaniaising,тАЭ inserting Dalits into the existing structures rather than transforming them. The vision of Ambedkar is akin to that of W E B Dubois, who insisted on political power, civil equality and higher education, and did not privilege capitalism. The author also feels that the left has mastered its plan of blaming Western imperial order as the central problem тАЬwhile remaining blind to the local, everyday caste oppressionsтАЭ carried out тАЬwithin the new capitalist market.тАЭ Dalits qua Dalits have no agency when they are listed by the left in the struggle against oppression. Brahmins and Brahminism The author thinks that although many atrocities on Dalits might be committed by the Shudras and Kshatriyas, it is the Brahmins who control and regulate the normative order manifested in the тАЬorganised power of religionтАЭ (p 290). It is the Brahminical order which assigns places and ranks within the social order. Brahmins have absolute control over spiritualityтАФtemples, rituals and wealth amassed through тАЬgodly guilt.тАЭ They enjoy monopoly over soft power, such as the media, and there is little representation there for Dalits or their concerns. Casteism or the ideology they sustain is the тАЬlongest-thriving pathologyтАЭ of conjuring differences between human beings that affects the тАЬmental and social healthтАЭ of the nation as a whole. A child is reared in emphasising differences and otherness. But, at the same time, тАЬan a-caste, тАЬnormal,тАЭ and тАЬneutralтАЭ identity dominates mainstream discourseтАФwhich is actually a thinly-veiled ideal of Brahmin identity that everyone is supposed to aspire to. Inevitably, amidst this narrative, it is the Dalit who is forced to feel the burden of being тАЬdifferent.тАЭ This makes Dalits to strive тАЬto be someone apart from a Dalit.тАЭ (p 288) тАЬThe Dalit lives in the miasma of Brahminical devaluation. The differences are markers of hatred, pain and sufferingтАЭ (p 289). While liberal Brahmins often lament Brahmin orthodoxy, they do not attack the тАЬcaste system in its entirety.тАЭ Therefore, there is a thin line between Brahmins and Brahminism. The author feels that тАЬblindfolding when it comes to privilegeтАЭ (p 245) is widespread in India. It is the Dalits and lower castes who are projected as corrupt, while large-scale looting of public money is done by the upper castes. Landed castes, as neo-Kshatriyas, are in the race too to loot public wealth. There were several Brahmins who were close companions of Phule and Ambedkar in their call to social revolution, and their sacrifices, courage and humanity deserve admiration. But, they tended to distance themselves when Ambedkar made the caste question primary. In IndiaтАЩs caste-setting, there is an urgent need of тАЬcultural suicide-bomber Brahmins who are willing to self-immolate and blow themselves up culturallyтАЭ (p 291). The Idea of the Dalit Self What is it that has made Dalits to survive against all odds, when barricades are drawn against them and they are тАЬpoliced since childhood, their actions being disciplined through the caste codesтАЭ? It lies in their тАЬinnate capacity to cultivate self-love in the bareness of apathy and tragedyтАЭ and тАЬthe audacity to hope while locked in darkness.тАЭ It lies тАЬin the resolution of the community to adhere to the principle of loveтАЭ (p 46) from which arises the principle of compassion. It is the courage to love in the face of oppression that forms their bridgehead to humanity. It is this attribute that nurtures a disposition of non-violence. The community privileges reason too. тАЬIt values the best of others and acknowledges the worst in others as a human fallibilityтАЭ (p 56). Brahminical culture does not accord recognition to Dalit endowments, leave alone achievements. Dalits are the тАЬcarriers of alternative traditions of counterculturesтАЭ that are repositories of тАЬsubtle modes of survival.тАЭ Humour is the most valued human expression in Dalit circles. Dalit language too is an expression of the art of resistance and survival. It harbours a spirit of universalism, common humanity, and maitri or fellowship. Striving to тАЬa horizontal order where no one is downgraded to sub-humanityтАЭ is common across Dalits. To global struggles, they hold forth the experience of тАЬtheir ability to thriveтАЭ amidst adversity. An Alternative Imaginary The author feels that Dalits seek a тАЬsystem of radical democratic governance operated by Dalits and non-Dalits of a liberal-radical bentтАЭ (p 89). тАЬDalit radicalism and Dalit dissentтАЭ would be an important resource for the same. Such a striving would tap тАЬthe glorious past and historical connection of Dalits to their ancestral chordтАЭ and AmbedkarтАЩs radical legacy and his colossal scholarship that sought a тАЬclass-based solution for all castesтАЭ (p 83). While the middle class harbours within it contradictory tendencies, and as a sociological concept is susceptible to diverse readings, it would be a false image of Dalit middle class if we equate it with the тАЬsalaried wage-negotiating class which mostly works in the service industry or public sectorтАЭ (p 163). From the 1990s, there is a new Dalit middle class in the offing. This class тАЬis largely urbane, aware, conscious and ready to fight, and is committed to their conviction for the communityтАЭ (p 164). This class possesses the social capital to stand on an equal footing with the rest. They have led movements, floated a large number of bodies, unions, organisations, political parties and offered ideological guidance. тАЬThey have matured the critical theory of Dalit liberation and made it publicly accessible for the general massтАЭ (p 167). They promote тАЬprogressive values,тАЭ тАЬdefy the regressive backwardismтАЭ imposed on them by тАЬcaste ecologyтАЭ and question тАЬthe legitimacy of the state led by the dominant caste minorityтАЭ (p 175). Dalits are committed to a nationalism that upholds тАЬrespect for everyone,тАЭ тАЬdignity and justiceтАЭ that each person owes to another, centres around Dalit lives, and redraws human boundaries. While there is an absence of hatred in it, it is ever-ready to retort the privilege blind. Dalits do not seek merely emancipation, that is, reforms and change of attitudes within structures which keep their agency stunted, but liberation, that is, to make themselves the тАЬgoverning class,тАЭ set up their own agenda, and privilege their own experiences. It factors in the oppression grounded on gender, religion, race and sexuality as integral to Dalit concerns. Distortions and Loud Claims If concern and the advocacy that ensues from it is the case, then you have much to take home in this book; if it is scholarship, then much of what the author says has already been said by others. There are category problems: caste and untouchable/Dalit while they share some things in common, are also very different realities. The untouchable is at the bottom of the caste, but they are also outside the system, and consequently weighed down by all the dung-heap that everyone else throws at them. The author largely focuses on the latter, but by simply encompassing them within the frame of caste, the book sheds little light on the kind of alignments that are required. While untouchability is a hydra-headed evil, its most stark reality is still in the countryside where humiliation and violence are imminent. Dalit women bear this brunt much more than others, and there are few sanctions against such onslaught. While such crude practices of untouchability are still extant in IndiaтАЩs urban landscape, and even in the diaspora, they are much more nuanced. Just because they are nuanced, they are not less effective, but untouchability practices in much of IndiaтАЩs countryside are a class apart in barbarity. The author does not pay any serious attention to this distinction. The practice of untouchability, and the kind of resources and opportunities that Dalits can access to are very uneven in India. The internal cleavages within Dalits can exacerbate this unevenness much further. The Maharashtra-focused experience that informs the book does not pay much heed to this unevenness. While Ambedkar remains the towering exemplar across this unevenness, this appeal remains too varied. The author does not show adequate attention to the wider cultural embeddedness of Dalits, a cultural resource that is increasingly co-opted by the Sangh Parivar today. The author does not seem to be very aware that Dalit communities all over India have held on to their folklore and cultural assertions. These resources form the bridgeheads to connect them to non-untouchable lower castes.  EPW looks forward to your comments. Please note that comments are moderated as per our comments policy.

Times of IndiaтАЩs Edit Page team comprises senior journalists with wide-ranging interests who debate and opine on the news and issues of the day. Politics is a lot about seizing the moment and Dalit neta Chandrashekhar Azad may have done just that when he showed up last month at the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi. Over 25 days in jail may have ensued but the optics of Azad at Jama Masjid, holding aloft a copy of the Constitution with BR AmbedkarтАЩs face adorning the cover, will endure for some time. In one stroke, Azad received the national attention he was seeking and projected himself as a votary of a Dalit-Muslim socio-political alliance. BSP supremo Mayawati has reason to worry after an unchallenged run as the countryтАЩs tallest Dalit neta since her mentor Kanshi RamтАЩs passing. Younger Dalits are not enthused by her aloofness and defeats in successive elections. AzadтАЩs Bhim Army rose to prominence during the 2017 Saharanpur riots when Dalits clashed violently with Thakurs, just months after BSPтАЩs rout and BJPтАЩs ascendance in the UP assembly polls. Arrested and detained for over a year under the draconian National Security Act, Azad has since toned down his rhetoric in an obvious attempt to widen his appeal. But can a Dalit-Muslim alliance take hold? Muslims in AzadтАЩs home state UP are split between SP, BSP and Congress. They made common cause with the Yadavs under the influence of Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav but ties are weakening now amid reverse consolidation by other groups. Actually Azad cannot even take Dalit support for granted. But his chutzpah marks him out. The present movement, like the anti-Emergency struggle, offers opportunities to new politicians to emerge. So the incongruity of the stiff bail terms keeping Azad out of Delhi until the assembly election sticks out. Disparate parties that sense the promise of this young politician would be happy that he is being kept away from the тАШactionтАЩ, for now.  {{C_D}} {{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

DGP Shivanand Jha also suspended police inspector NK Rabari who was accused of delaying the registration of complaint by the womanтАЩs relatives when she went missing. He was transferred from Modasa town police station to Isari police station in the district on January 12. The three-member SIT headed by DIG Gautam Parmar will also probe allegations against the police officers of derailing the probe and delaying the registration of the complaint. The womanтАЩs body was found hanging from a tree on January 5, within days after she went missing. Family of the deceased alleged that the woman was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered by four accused persons, of which three have been arrested. The fourth accused is still on the run. All the four have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act. The FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by a family member of the woman. In the FIR, the complainant alleged that town police inspector Rabari did not act on a complaint that the woman went missing on January 3. The FIR states that Rabari had told the family that their daughter had married a man of her community and that Rabari would produce her along with a marriage certificate.

Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize The endemic nature of quotidian caste atrocity and episodic inter-religious communal violence, and especially its effect on women, has historically assumed an air of eerie obviousness in the popular imagination in India. Yet the phrase тАЬrising intoleranceтАЭ employed in recent discussions indicates a dramatic escalation of various manifestations of violence, especially since the right-wing BJP captured power in 2014. The murders of rationalists, the lynching of Dalits and Muslims on the pretext of saving the cow, the crackdown on dissenting student voices from marginalized sections or radical political traditions and the general culture of fear generated in the public sphere are unprecedented. How does one account for this contemporary rage and violence? I would tentatively engage with this question by advancing two lines of argument. First, in India the тАЬsocialтАЭ, configured primarily in terms of caste, is the key storehouse of power. One may locate the contemporary rage and intolerance in the dislocations within the social due to the sedimentation of neo-liberal and democratic discourses. Second, there is rising intolerance across faith traditions. Since caste is not merely a Hindu phenomenon but constitutes the specific South Asian sociality that cuts across faiths269, the ruptures in the social affect all religious collectivities. While the competitive nature of inter-religious violence or communalism, which often foregrounds тАЬmajority-minorityтАЭ or тАЬHindutva-IslamismтАЭ duopolies, is often the object of most enquiries, I would suggest that one also needs to retrieve the symbiotic and co-constitutive nature of contending communalisms as restorative attempts to preserve the de facto law of caste by elites across religions.- I Caste in South Asia has been a key mode of exclusion that has hitherto governed the distribution of power and resources. Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the foremost anti-caste theoretician and leader, termed the caste system Brahmanism and articulated it as a system of graded inequality that entailed тАЬa gradation of castes forming an ascending scale of reverence and a descending scale of contempt.тАЭ It is a system of ranked differences where the four major status groups or varnasтАФBrahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants), Shudras (labourers/artisans)тАФare hierarchically arranged in terms of purity and pollution, with Brahmins being considered ritually the purest. There is also a fifth group of avarnas/panchamas/atishudra, now popularly recognized as Dalits, which comprise the formerly untouchables and are technically outside the fourfold caste order. Adding to the complexity of social stratification, each of these broad normative categories is further differentiated internally into endogamous and hereditary occupational groups termed jatis. In practice, jatis are probably the more functional and easily identifiable units, even when their textual hierarchy is often complicated, subverted and redefined daily in the political. As an enduring effect of orientalist discourse, caste has been usually framed as a Hindu phenomenon but empirically it has organized social life in all religious traditionsтАФincluding Islam and ChristianityтАФin India. For instance, among Muslims three kinds of status groups can be identified: One, those who trace their origin to foreign lands and the converts from Hindu higher castes (ashraf); two, the converts from clean occupational castes (ajlaf); and three, the converts from the formerly untouchable (Dalit) castes (arzal). Moreover, the Ashraf constitute the highest stratum within this structure. Their position and rank within the Muslim caste system is almost identical with that which the Brahman and Kshatriya grouped together are granted in the Hindu caste hierarchy. Thus, both the Sayyad and Shaikh, as competent religious pedagogues and priests, are almost identical with the Brahman; whereas both the Mughal and Pathan, being famous for their chivalry, appear to be equal to the Kshatriya. In recent decades, the Pasmanda movement, organized by the lower-caste Muslims in order to challenge upper-caste hegemony within Indian Islam, tries to address this gap. The Pasmanda discourse has foregrounded the complicity of upper-caste Muslim elites in sustaining and reproducing communal discourse that is often instrumental in legitimizing episodes of communal violence. In fact, there is a stress on the dialectical relationship between majority and minority communalisms and the Pasmanda movement proposes to contest minoritarian fundamentalism from within in order to wage a decisive battle against majoritarian fundamentalism at the national level. Ali Anwar, the leader of the movement, opines thus: We see that the politics of communalism, fuelled by both Hindu and Muslim elites, is aimed at dividing us, making us fight among ourselves, so that the elites continue to rule over us as they have been doing for centuries. This is why weтАжhave been seeking to steer our people from emotional politics to politics centred on issues of survival and daily existence and social justice, and for this we have been working with non-Muslim Dalit and Backward Caste movements and groups to struggle jointly for our rights and to oppose the politics of communalism fuelled by Hindu and Muslim тАШupperтАЩ caste elites.

"15",114,"https://www.newsclick.in/Khairlanji-Hathras-Rape-Story-Repeats-Dalit-Women","From Khairlanji to Hathras, Rape Story Repeats Itself for Dalit Women | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS The visceral screams of fear and pain, the sense of utter powerlessness, the dread of ominous threats coming true, the sheer brutalityтАФall of it must have been the same for the 19-year-old who was violated in Boolgarhi village in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh as for 17-year-old Priyanka Bhotmange and her mother Surekha in Khairlanji village, Maharashtra. The two incidents of alleged gang rape and murder of dalit women are separated by 14 long years, during which IndiaтАЩs collective conscience and sensitivity to such crimes was supposedly sharpened by the Nirbhaya case, but the arc of safety and security does not bend any more towards womenтАФespecially dalit womenтАФnow than it did in 2006. On the contrary, crimes against dalit women, especially assault and rape, have increased manifold. After the Bhotmange womenтАЩs mutilated bodies were fished out of a canal in Khairlanji, Bhandara district in Maharashtra, along with violated bodies of PriyankaтАЩs two teenage brothers, on September 29, 2006, it took public outrage, mainly by dalit organisations, for the then Maharashtra government to crank up action. The outrage also stirred Mumbai and DelhiтАЩs media towards covering the horror that had unfolded that evening. In these respects too, not much changed in the past 14 years. MaharashtraтАЩs then Home Minister had expressed doubts that the victims may have been Maoists. In the Hathras case, Uttar Pradesh officials were crass. They initially denied the incident, then called it тАЬfake newsтАЭ, and displayed their most impervious side, making the brutalised 19-year-old lie on a bench under the blazing sun, sending her only to a local hospital despite grievous injuries, taking her to Delhi only after she turned critical, according to her family. If this was not enough, they burned her body after locking up her family in their home in the middle of the night and admonishing them тАЬaap se bhi kuch galatiyan hui haiтАЭ. Dalit women live with little dignity, it seems they must die without dignity too. From Khairlanji to Hathras lie lakhs of storiesтАФmany of them corpsesтАФof brutalised women, especially dalit and tribal women, all of whom bore the brunt of toxic masculinity along with gender or caste supremacy on their bodies. From 2006 to 2019, the total number of rapes reported is over 4,00,000; a substantial number of the reported rapesтАФsome estimates say one in every fourтАФis on dalit women. For every rape reported, several go unreported. And this reporting does not include marital rapes. The National Crime Records Bureau data shows the total number of rapes reported in 2006 was a shade less than 20,000; 10 years later, it was closer to 40,000. Occasionally, a particularly brutal case might catch the nationтАЩs attention. NirbhayaтАЩs plight shook the nation in December 2012, the outrage turned public opinion against the incumbent Congress-led governments in Delhi and the Centre. It led to changes in the criminal law on rape and solemn pledges of тАЬno more NirbhayasтАЭ, a fund was set up, and the case exploited by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 general election. The rise in total rape numbers every year since then was cited as evidence of more women reporting the crime. It might be partly true. The sustained coverage of the Nirbhaya case might have chipped away some of the stigma around reporting rape, but it also established that as many women were being raped. The total number clocking well above 32,000-33,000 every yearтАФ2016 was the worst in the past seven yearsтАФmeant nearly 90 women raped every day. The large majority are statistics, a few are remembered like the little girl in a Kathua temple, the 12-year-old in Chennai raped over seven months, the Kerala nuns, the Unnao case in which the victim was set ablaze near a court, the young woman in Uttar Pradesh who saw her family wiped out after raising her voice against BJPтАЩs MLA Kuldip Sengar and the young veterinarian in Hyderabad. However, to read the rape story only through numbers would be to skim the surface of the horror women face every day. Parse the numbers and the relationship between caste and rape, or any crime against women, is inescapable. Overlay this with state-wise data and it is evident that dalit women in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where toxic masculinity meets caste bigotries, face the worst of sexual crimes. These states consistently rank high for crimes against women, especially rapes, and of dalit women. The perpetrators, almost without exception, are men of upper castes. Crimes against dalits increased by 6% between 2009 and 2018, according to the National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) report this year. тАЬDalit women often bear the brunt of violence at the hand of dominant caste; violence as grave as physical violence, sexual violence and witch branding. In the Covid-19 pandemic also, Dalit women witnessed various forms of atrocitiesтАж In the last five years, 41,867 cases or 20.40% were related to violence against Scheduled Caste women,тАЭ the report said. The NCRB confirms the trend of crimes against dalits. It registered surges in such crimes every year between 2013 and 2018. Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against dalits, at 25.6% of all cases reported. In 2017, the agency published data for cases specifically and exclusively registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. There were 5,775 cases; 55% of them related to тАЬintentional insult or intimidation with intent to humiliateтАЭ dalits, other cases pertained to occupation of dalitsтАЩ land, preventing dalits from using public places and social boycott. In Boolgarhi-Hathras, the victimтАЩs family was among the few dalit families in the village and had a running dispute over land with their upper casteтАФThakurтАФneighbour, according to her brother who spoke to the media. His grandfather had lost his fingers while trying to save himself during an attack some years ago, he added, detailing how shop-keepers sprinkle water on the money they handed out or how they are not allowed to touch merchandise in a shop. To ignore the context of caste and see it merely as a sexual crime would be meaningless. The young woman, as activists and scholars have pointed out, was assaulted, violated and tortured by the Thakur men to send out a message: stay within your status, donтАЩt mess with us. In Khairlanji, the story was similar. The Bhotmanges was among the handful of dalit houses in the village dominated by OBC-Kunbi caste. Most of the local chatter about why the family was heinously attacked and killed centred on the fact that they owned and tilled five acres, Surekha managed the land affairs herself, and was making sure that her children studied well. She had also stood witness for a Khairlanji policeman in an altercation he had had with some villagers. Together, it was seen as an affront by the upper caste men. The family was not allowed to build a pucca house, Surekha was тАЬa mere Dalit woman was thumbing at usтАЭ as an accused villager had told this writer. Surekha was not only raped, she was stripped and paraded around the village, then sexually assaulted by a large group of men such that her skull was broken and an eye was disgorged. Her daughter too was paraded naked, raped, and foreign objects were found in her private parts. Her brothers too suffered similar assaults. These were caste atrocities beyond a shadow of doubt. тАЬThe entire village was involved, I was in my farm and then I hid behind a bush,тАЭ said Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange, SurekhaтАЩs husband. Local cops were suspended and the case investigated by the CBI. The fast-track trial court held eight people guilty of murder and handed out death penalty to six of them. In 2010, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court heard appeals and commuted the death sentence to 25 years imprisonment; it also termed the murders as тАЬrevenge killingsтАЭ and held that the murders were not pre-meditated or motivated by caste prejudices. The SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was ignoredтАФand a justification was found for this too. Equally shocking was that the guilty were absolved of rape charges. The delay in registering cases and conducting medical examinations, unwillingness of the local police to prevent erasure of evidence, lackadaisical prosecution were all responsible. The judgement makes a reference to how PriyankaтАЩs body bore injury marks all over and that the accused disrobed her тАЬto get satisfaction to their sexual eyesтАЭ but the court held the women were not raped. Bhotmange got some compensation and lived elsewhere, he used to go to his house every September 29, to light a lamp. He died three years ago. The appeals are pending in the Supreme Court. In the Hathras case too, the police reportedly prevented the family from even seeing the victim one last time, held back all villagers, and most insensitively burned her body in the dead of the night. The national outrage ensured that the accused were arrested. But no one is sure that the medical evidence collected will prove the charges of rape in the fast-track court that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath set up under pressure. A savarna (upper caste) group already banded together to express support for the accused but the Chief Minister waited out two weeksтАФand for a nudge from the Prime MinisterтАФbefore even setting up a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. Even as this was announced, the equally heinous Balrampur case came to lightтАФagain a young dalit woman, breaking boundaries to get educated, raped and murdered allegedly by two Muslim men. Crimes against dalitsтАФand tribalsтАФincluding rape does not happen out of the blue. It often begins with age-old discriminations, each case of insult to and assault of dalits over months and years on land or water or access to public spaces creates an atmosphere in which dalits can be attackedтАФwith impunity. The atmosphere when such seemingly minor cases go unrecorded or unpunished is that upper castes can get away because the administration is тАЬon our sideтАЭ. Small sections of national or local media have recorded minor crimes against dalits in the past few months; a journalist took note of nearly 18 rapes or gang-rapes in two days after the Hathras incident. These sustained and heinous crimes are a message, according to dalit scholar and professor Anand Teltumbde, now accused of Maoist links and imprisoned. Atrocities against dalits have тАЬa unique mix of sadism and bestialityтАЭ, he and S Anand wrote, 10 years after the Khairlanji shocker, atrocities are тАЬa mode of teaching a lesson to the entire Dalit communityтАЭ. Teltumbde spoke of how Khairlanji dispelled many myths, including that economic development does away with casteism or that dalits in political or administrative power can orient the administration to do justice for the community. The few dalit MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh legislature have been unmoved so far about the insults or atrocities. The Assembly from 2017 comprises nearly 45% upper caste MLAs, up 12% from the previous Assembly. Ministers in Narendra ModiтАЩs cabinet who made political capital out of the Nirbhaya case, even Modi himself, have said little by way of consolation or condemnation of the incidents. Former Union Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and the incumbent, Smriti Irani, were elected from Uttar Pradesh but the vocal women have not said a word. There is no getting away from the fact that the BJP is heavily weighted in favour of upper castesтАФbrahmins, thakurs and baniasтАФin its election strategies and political capital, never mind the talk about тАЬsabka saathтАЭ. In his analytical book, тАШKhairlanji: A Strange and Bitter CropтАЭ, Teltumbde detailed why such cases of extreme brutality on dalits, especially women, are not тАЬisolated eventsтАЭ or тАЬjust misdeeds of some uncultured barbaric monstersтАЭ. Violence against dalits, especially rape, is a functional and systematic way of enforcing social order which is why it is тАЬperformed as a public spectacle by collectivesтАжrape is not a private affair, it becomes a celebratory spectacle. Atrocities involve intricate and devious planning so that they become a тАШlessonтАЩ for the entire Dalit communityтАЭ, he wrote. This is why knee-jerk reactions such as тАЬhang the rapistsтАЭ cries that gathered momentum over Hathras, hanging the rapists of Nirbhaya, killing the accused in police encounters as in Hyderabad do not address the core issue of continuing and escalating attacks on dalits. These actions merely satisfy the revenge motive in an outraged public without in any way addressing the underlying caste issues. That is why, in his book, Teltumbde cautioned, тАЬEvery village in India is a potential KhairlanjiтАЭ.

The Congress and the BJP in Madhya Pradesh hit out at each other after a 24-year-old Dalit man was set ablaze in Sagar district on Tuesday, 14 January. Dhanprasad Ahirwar was doused in kerosene and set on fire by his neighbours Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan, and is battling for life in Bhopal's Hamidia Hospital with over 70 percent burns, Motinagar police station in charge Sangita Singh said on Saturday, 18 January. Ahirwar had filed a police complaint over a dispute and the accused were forcing him to take it back, Singh said, adding that Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan had been arrested. Leader of Opposition in the MP Assembly Gopal Bhargava visited Ahirwar in Hamidia Hospital and claimed crimes against Dalits were increasing under the Kamal Nath government. State BJP president Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had told police three times that his life was in danger but he got no help from the authorities. He said police did not act on Ahirwar's apprehensions because of the Congress-led government's vote-bank politics and policy of appeasement. The MP Congress, meanwhile, hit out at the BJP and said it was giving a communal colour to every issue. ""The BJP needs to change its perception of seeing communal politics in every issue. This is a criminal case and the police have arrested the accused immediately,"" MP Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said. (This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed.

The court has also imposed a total fine of Rs 26,000 on them. The body of the 30-year-old woman was found with her throat slit and stab marks on 25 November, 2019, a day after the offence. The woman used to sell balloons for a living. Three men were arrested on November 27 and charged under relevant sections of the Indan Penal Code for gang rape and murder besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Additional Public Prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. The court found them guilty under all the sections and awarded the death penalty. The three accused had earlier pleaded not guilty. Expressing happiness over the verdict, the woman's husband said ""We are happy. Justice has been meted out and we request the court that they should be hanged immediately."" The Telangana government had last month issued orders, designating the Fifth Additional Sessions Court as the special court for speedy trial in the case. On December 14, 2019, a charge sheet was filed and the trial commenced on December 23. Arguments were completed on January 20 and the case was subsequently posted for judgment. As many 25 witnesses were produced by the prosecution that had been demanding capital punishment on the lines of death penalty awarded to the accused in the Nirbhaya gang rape murder case in Delhi.  Earlier in December, the woman's family and different organisations had staged protests and demanded an ""encounter"" death for the three men like the four accused in the Hyderabad veterinarian's gang rape and murder case. The four accused in the veterinarian case were killed in an alleged exchange of fire with police on the outskirts of Hyderabad on December 6, 2019.

According to the postmortem reports, she was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered before her body was found hanging by the tree. According to a report in The Hindu, the accused hanged the body of the victim from the tree to make it look like a suicide. The victim had gone missing on 31st December. According to The National Herald, the family approached the local police to file an FIR on 3rd January but the police refused. Inspector NL Rabri, told the family that the girl had eloped with a boy from the same community and insisted that she was 'safe'. The family refused to claim the body until an FIR was filed, they believed that the accused was murdered. It was only on Tuesday, two days after the body was found that the police officially registered an FIR against four men, Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvard, Satish Bharvard and Jigar in this case. Gandhinagar Range Inspector, General Mayansilh Chavda further added: With an aim to spread awareness and bring justice to the victim, netizens have taken to Twitter using a trending hashtag: *Images of tweets are sourced directly from Twitter . The hashtag has been blurred to conceal the identity of the victim.*","IND","dalit",1,1,1,3

The woman's father sits next to a framed photo of her. Photo: Sukanya Shantha Sayara village, Modasa: The beaming face of a 19- year old woman shines out of a tall, white flex- board hoisted right at the entrance of the Dalit basti in Sayara village of Modasa Taluka. Villagers stop by for a moment or two with their folded hands and read the description printed on the board. The board offers homage to a teenager who was allegedly abducted, gang-raped and brutally murdered on January 5. They hurriedly walk away when inquired about the incident. No one wants to talk about the horrid incident. On January 5, the body of the young woman was found hanging on a long-standing banyan tree, bang at the entrance of the village. The teenager, a second-year commerce student, the sixth of the seven siblings, had left home on January 1 to register herself for an advanced computer course. She never returned. Three weeks since her death and two different investigations later, it has now emerged that the victim was brutally sodomized, dragged and then forcibly hanged from the tree, according to an Ahemdabad Mirror report. Four men, all in their early 20s, have been accused in the case. Also Read: Gujarat Village Erupts in Protests After 19-Year-Old Dalit Woman Gang-Raped and Hanged After the victim went missing on January 1, the family says they waited for two days for her to return. тАЬWhen she didnтАЩt, we went to the Modasa town police station on the early morning of January 3,тАЭ her distraught mother says. At the police station, the family claims, police inspector N.K. Rabari asked them to not worry and told the family that the victim had married someone within their caste. тАЬHe spoke to us as if he had definitive information about her whereabouts. He even told us that he would soon produce my daughter with her marriage certificate,тАЭ the father, a farm labourer shared. Rabari has since been suspended from work and the recently formed Special Investigations Team (SIT), led by deputy inspector general (DIG) Gautam Parmar is also probing RabariтАЩs probable link with the accused persons. The victimтАЩs elder sister, a 21-year-old beautician, is key to the investigation. She had allegedly seen the victim being abducted from a village bus stop on January 1 around 1 pm. In her statement, she has named four men тАУ Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Jigar and Satish Bharvad тАУ of forcibly taking her away in a four-wheeler, now identified as a Hyundai i20, keeping her confined for four days, raping her and then hanging her from the tree. While the first three surrendered before the police, Satish Bharvad is absconding. All accused belong to the Rabari caste, a pastoral community classified as an Other Backward Classes (OBC) in Gujarat. Although the community is largely economically and socially backward, the victimтАЩs relatives say Bimal BharvadтАЩs family, particularly, is landed and has political clout. From the start, the investigation did not inspire the familyтАЩs trust. The victimтАЩs mother says, they had waited for four days for their daughter to return. The police failed to act and then on January 5, the body was finally found hanging. тАЬUnderneath the tree, a small temple of Kodialmata has been built. On January 5, when the priest went to pray, he looked up and found the body hanging. He raised an alarm and we were soon informed,тАЭ the mother says. тАЬOnly if the police had acted upon our complaint swiftly, our daughter could have been saved, perhaps,тАЭ she adds. The family used to live in a hut built on their small patch of land, but has since moved to a relativeтАЩs house in Sayara village. The Wire tried to find the priest who found the body for his version of the story. Most villagers claimed they did not know him and dissuaded this reporter from probing further. One person, however, said the priest belonged to the Panchal community and the land adjoining the Banyan tree belonged to the priest. Once the body was found hanging, the family and Dalit rights activists from several parts of Gujarat had gathered in the village and demanded the police arrest the accused immediately. The family refused to let the body be taken for autopsy until the FIR was registered. The FIR has several sections of the Indian Penal Code for abduction, gangrape, and murder. Sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been slapped on the accused. The Wire visited the spot where the body was found hanging. Although it was made to look like the young student took her own life, the body was knotted to a blue cloth at a height of around 20 feet, which is unlikely for a person of frail built to scale. The victim, according to the post mortem report, was only 152 centimetres tall and petite. The spot where the body was found hanging. Photo: Sukanya Shantha Discrepancies in the investigation Questions have been raised not just about the policeтАЩs refusal to act upon the complaint immediately but also in the way the investigations were carried out. For instance, the first interpretation of the post mortem report drawn soon after the body was recovered suggests there werenтАЩt any injury marks on her genitalia. The report, however, suggested injuries were sustained to her neck. The report mentioned that тАЬpart of rectum is prolapsed out from anal canalтАЭ, but this crucial information was not taken into consideration. The second post mortem, provided by a panel of five forensic scientists, has indicated that the victim was sodomized repeatedly. The second report also points to four different injuries on the body of the victim. Besides the injury on her neck, the woman sustained тАЬabraded contusionsтАЭ to her forearm, abrasion on her upper chest towards the left side, and on her left arm. These abrasions, the report has suggested could have been sustained during a struggle or when being dragged on a hard surface. Until now, only the family had claimed that she was sexually assaulted. This report has substantiated the familyтАЩs claims. A senior police officer, however, has claimed that the forensic report received after the analysis of the victimтАЩs body doesnтАЩt show the presence of any тАЬforeign particlesтАЭ. тАЬNo saliva, hair or semen was found on her body. This, however, doesnтАЩt mean that the victim was not sexually assaulted. They could have used precaution at the time of the assault.тАЭ He added that the forensic report on her clothes is awaited. Family members went to the home of one of the accused The statements given by the victimтАЩs sister have also shifted substantially. Strangely, the family had not named the accused until the womanтАЩs body was found on January 5. This, even when the victimтАЩs sister says she saw the men drag the woman into a car, argue with her before zipping past her. According to the sisterтАЩs statement recorded in the FIR on January 5, soon after the victim was abducted, the family along with several men from the community, visited the spot where she was abduted. They retrieved CCTV footage from a nearby establishment, identified the car and its car number and then visited prime accused Bimal BharvadтАЩs house. Here, the sister claims, the family urged BimalтАЩs father Bharatbhai Bharvad to return their child back to them. A couple of days after, at the time of a protest meet arranged in the village, the victimтАЩs sister in a video recording again repeated her statement as given to the police. Here, however, she mentioned that she was with the victim from 9 am to 1 pm. She is also seen identifying the men by their names and their respective villages. Also Read: Most Crimes Against Dalits Are Against SC Women: NCRB Data When The Wire and Shantaben Senma, a social worker from Gujarat-based Dalit rights organisation Navsarjan Trust, met the family on January 19, the family repeated their statement. However, they claimed that the men were unknown to them. They refused to name any of them and denied having met the family of one of the accused while looking for the victim. The victimтАЩs sister has been unwell since the past week and the SIT, after several attempts, questioned her only on January 22. Modasa village in Gujarat. Photo: Google Maps тАЬMy child was my prideтАЭ Among seven siblings тАУ six daughters and a son тАУ the victim was the only one who had continued to pursue her education. The parents say despite the familyтАЩs difficulties, she had insisted on completing her studies. тАЬWe could not afford to educate them, so my other children had to drop out of school. She was studious, so we sent her to her auntтАЩs place in Isari at a very young age,тАЭ the mother shares. тАЬMy child was my pride,тАЭ the father adds. The family is only one of four that belong to the Chamar community, a Scheduled Caste, in the village. The village predominantly comprises of Patel, Thakor, Darbar, Rabari and Panchal houses. There are also a few dozen houses of the Vankar community, another Scheduled Caste. Social segregation is palpable in the village, with the Dalit basti built separately at a corner, away from the houses of the dominant castes. The victimтАЩs family, like other Dalits in the village, survives on frugal means, depending on a very small patch of land. The victim was their hope for a better future. тАЬThey snatched our only hope from us,тАЭ the father says.","IND","dalit",1,3,1,3
"21",141,"https://frontline.thehindu.com/cover-story/targeted-violence/article30565035.ece","Violence targeted at Dalit and Muslim students","| A visually impaired student who was attacked by the masked goons at the Sabarmati Hostel in JNU on January 6. Photo: R.V. Moorthy June 7, 2005: ABVP students trying to disrupt the meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education called to discuss the National Curriculum Framework of School Education at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. Photo: The Hindu archives ABVP supporters march in support of the new citizenship law in Ahmedabed on December 18. Photo: Ajit Solanki/AP Shortly after masked assailants, allegedly belonging to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), created havoc on the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in New Delhi on January 5, mauling students, ransacking hostels, and brandishing iron rods, the picture of a visually impaired student, who was one of those targeted, emerged on social media. Surya Prakash, a student pursuing MPhil in Sanskrit, was allegedly targeted because a picture of Dr B.R. Ambedkar was seen on the door of his room. If Surya Prakash was attacked because he was a Dalit and identified himself with Ambedkar, Pervez and Mumtaz, pursuing courses in Persian, were targeted because of their religion. For Kashmiri Muslim students it was a double whammy; they were Muslim and also Kashmiri. That was reason enough to attack them, ransack their rooms, and break the doors and windows of their rooms. The rampage drove the students away. A day after the attack, many of the rooms belonging to Muslim and Dalit students were found locked. As admitted by one of the ABVP functionaries on television, the violence was targeted. Besides Dalits and Muslims, the goons focussed their energies on Left-leaning students and those belonging to the studentsтАЩ union. Rooms belonging to students with ideological affiliation to the ABVP were not touched. The attackers, it seemed, were keen to carry forward the casteist and communal agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) according to which a Muslim is the perpetual тАЬotherтАЭ, the Dalit is supposed to exist only at the sufferance of the twice born, and Left parties are an anathema to the idea of a Hindu Rashtra. The ABVP takes a lot of pride in its association with the RSS. Always keen to dispel the impression that it is the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ABVP, founded in 1948, makes it clear that it is the student wing of the RSS. Says the noted JNU historian Aditya Mukherjee: тАЬThey assert themselves as a wing of the RSS. They are very conscious about it, very clear. They draw their inspiration from their parent body. Their tactics have always been about muzzling and browbeating, not civil discourse. It is always about provocation. After all, they are a wing of the RSS.тАЭ Prof. Rizwan Qaiser, who teaches history at Jamia Millia Islamia (this Central university campus was also witness to violence as part of the protests against the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019) concurs with these views. тАЬThey will never show it on paper, but they are very much associated with the BJP. In terms of ideology and cadre support, however, they are dependent on the RSS. Many people will recall how they came to the fore during Anna HazareтАЩs [anti-corruption] agitation in 2011. The protest held at the Ramlila ground in Delhi, ranging from the crowd to banners, to the food, to even the Anna Hazare caps the protesters wore, were all funded by the RSS. And ABVP members acted as the organisationтАЩs foot soldiers during the entire movement. They were everywhere. So much so that to the common man it seemed as if the Anna Hazare movement was a movement of IndiaтАЩs youth against the government.тАЭ Qaiser draws an interesting parallel between the RSS and the ABVP. тАЬThe real agenda of the ABVP for the past many decades has been to project themselves as nationalists or hyper-nationalists, just as BJP leaders seek to do today. The rest of the people are not nationalists, they are compromised. It is the same ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha used to follow in the pre-1947 period claiming that they were true nationalists and the Congress stood compromised. The ABVP has been doing it for years now. For them, if you are not with them, you stand compromised. Clearly, there is not much difference between the ABVP and the RSS. Whosoever is in ABVP today is likely to be in RSS some day, if not now.тАЭ Ajay Gudavarthy, Associate Professor in the Centre for Political Studies, JNU, expressed similar views. Gudavarthy, who has some ABVP members among his students, says, тАЬThey have links with the RSS. A lot of ABVP students have direct contact with the RSS. There is a pracharak who keeps guiding them on how to act at a particular time. They get their instructions from him. They meet him every fortnight. There is a complete hierarchy. But I do feel the ABVP members are at times just pushed into something. For instance, in JNU, they were in agreement with their students that the Vice Chancellor should be removed and the fee hike should be rolled back. But the RSS dissuaded them. The RSS targets JNU through the ABVP for ideological reasons. The very presence of the university makes them feel inferior. They provoke, but do not know how to resolve the issue. Some of my students who are ABVP members tell me that they raise questions with the RSS pracharak. In the fee rise case, too, they asked how the organisation can be popular on the campus when 60 per cent of the students cannot afford the new fee structure. But the RSS wants to change the character of the university by changing the fee structure so that the poor do not enter it. Many of the poor people today, however, are part of the RSS. The RSS guys do not know how to address this anomaly. When they do not know how to resolve a thing, they take to violence and criminality, as seen recently. I have never seen the ABVP engaged in dialogue, debate, discussion. They are usually combative. Some of it stems from their background. Many of them come from the landlord background since the colonial, even pre-colonial times. For decades, upper castes have joined the ABVP. Now, the Other Backward Classes [OBC] masculinity has also joined them.тАЭ Hence, the violence inflicted on Muslim and Dalit students in JNU. Gudavarthy says: тАЬThe ABVPтАЩs anti-Muslim narrative, like that of the parent body, is a compulsive narrative. With an alternative movement gaining ground across the country, they have to create an enemy, hatch some conspiracy. Their politics caters to only the elite social structure. To camouflage it, they have to target Muslims. The Muslim card is a compulsion. They employ the Muslim narrative in a contextual manner. Same is the case of Dalit politics. It stems from a pathological mindset, the upper-caste dominant narrative unable to cope with the changing social narrative. They cannot digest diversity and plurality. It challenges their very being. Women in public space irritate them. Different languages in public space irritate them. Muslims, Dalits, anybody who is not like them irritate them.тАЭ Talking of JNU, the ABVP has never had a strong presence on the campus. Prof. Mukherjee says, тАЬUntil 10 years ago, they had no influence in JNU. It has not changed much now either. They have had to import goons for violence.тАЭ According to Prof. Qaiser, тАЬthe ABVP never had a formal presence on the campus. When I studied there in the 1970s and 1980s, there was no mention of the ABVP. Many people of that ideology were there informally, but joined other bodies. Much later one discovered, тАШoh, he turned out to be from the ABVPтАЩ. They were never encouraged in the past. Now they enjoy a free run. Fortunately, there are not many takers for that ideology on the campus today also.тАЭ Yet, there is one crucial difference. Over the years, the ABVP has transformed itself from being a marginal presence to a central one. In the past, the body sought legitimacy through association with others; today it seeks to confer legitimacy on many a young, aspirational student, giving them hope of becoming a Central Minister, like Arun Jaitley, the late Finance Minister in Prime Minister Narendra ModiтАЩs Cabinet. Qaiser says: тАЬThe ABVP would ride piggyback on any movement in the past. They populated the Jayaprakash Narayan movement in the 1970s and attained legitimacy. Now, they are unleashing a horse on their own. In 1975, they were like fringe elements. Now, they call the shots. They draw inspiration from the top. They are just running amok.тАЭ After the Emergency, the ABVP came into limelight towards the end of the 1980s during the anti-Mandal agitation. тАЬThey were opposed to Mandal. Their opposition, however, was not based on principles of equity or equality of opportunity for all, but on a casteist agenda of keeping a section down. They were, like the RSS, carrying forward the Manuvad agenda,тАЭ says Prof. Mukherjee. Incidentally, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ABVP was not the only body affiliated to the RSS to gain legitimacy. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad gained prominence and Bajrang Dal members gained popularity by sending the BJP leader L.K. Advani a cup of their blood as he set out on his rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya. As Dhirendra Jha writes in Shadow Armies: Fringe Organizations and Foot Soldiers of Hindutva, they тАЬalso welcomed him by applying tilak of blood on his foreheadтАж. After the BJP formed a government in Uttar Pradesh in 1991, it was the Bajrang Dal which directly participated in skirmishes on the Ayodhya issue while the prominent constituents of the Sangh ParivarтАФthe RSS, the BJP and even the VHPтАФshunned any public posturing. This was a well-considered strategy where an affiliate organisation lower down the hierarchy was deployed to keep an issue alive for future exploitation while the more important fronts remained relatively quiet to prevent any embarrassment for the BJP government.тАЭ The Bajrang DalтАЩs strategy of the 1980s and the early 1990s is being practised by the ABVP today. Even as the ABVP cadre unleashed violence on the JNU campus, and about a year earlier in September 2019 in Jadavpur University, where, too, ABVP volunteers committed arson at the university gate and ransacked rooms, besides indulging in violence in Delhi University, Bengaluru and elsewhere, the RSS stayed mum, and the BJP government at the Centre maintained a studied silence. All this is part of the time-tested strategy, seen and experienced in the past. The ABVP, like the Bajrang Dal, drinks from the fount of the RSS.","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

The deceased identified as Dhaniram Ahirwar was set to fire after pouring kerosene on him on Tuesday in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh. The horrific incident took place on January 14 in Dharmashree area which comes under Motinagar police station in Sagar in Madhya Pradesh. Dhaniram had some dispute with a group of people including Chuttu, Azzu Pathan, Kallu and Irfan which led to the death of Dhaniram Ahirwar. On 14 January, Ahirwar was surrounded by Muslim men and they attacked him as well as his family. They then poured kerosene on him and set him to fire. It is alleged that around 15 to 20 persons from the Muslim community carried out this terrible incident. The accused persons were said to have been torturing Dhaniram for last seven months. He had already registered a complaint against them, saying that he is being harassed and his life is under threat, but no strict action was taken by Police. The 24-year-old suffered 55% to 70% burns and was rushed to the hospital. On January 21, he was admitted to Delhi hospital as around 70% of his body got burnt.

The Dalit leaderтАЩs comments come days after he suggested the Bombay High Court asked the state government to utilise funds sanctioned for the proposed statue of his grandfather at Indu Mill in Mumbai for improvement of the cash-strapped Wadia hospitals for women and children instead. тАЬThe greatness of B R Ambedkar cannot be measured with the height of a statue. It is a futile exercise undertaken by successive governments to serve their politics,тАЭ Prakash Ambedkar told The Indian Express. On January 15, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had approved a proposal to raise the height of the proposed statue for Ambedkar by 100 feet and cleared the revised expenditure of Rs 1089.95 crore from Rs 750 crore for it. The VBA chief said, тАЬI have conveyed my reservation to the present plan for the memorial with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. I have also offered to discuss with them my original concept, which was evolved way back in 1998-99 when the NDA government was at the Centre.тАЭ He added then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given his consent for an Ambedkar International Study Centre, but could never be translated into reality as mainstream political parties, including BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP, were keen on a memorial and a statue. тАЬWhat is the purpose of having another statue of Ambedkar in Mumbai? At the most, it will be taller than the ones already existing at Chembur and Vidhan Bhawan.

"29",214,"https://intpolicydigest.org/2020/01/15/the-position-of-dalit-women-in-indian-society/","The Position of Dalit Women in Indian Society","The caste system is an ancient societal classification of people based on their varna (caste order or class) or jati (birth). An apartheid-like system, IndiaтАЩs caste order is the archetype of the closed system of social mobility and a structure rigged towards oppression regardless. This orthodox classification once determined a personтАЩs occupation, marriage practices, and the privileges one enjoyed. In the varna system, extensively discussed in the Dharma Shastras, Dalits were positioned beneath the caste order itself, in a group that was casteless, тАШuntouchableтАЩ and alienated. Women who belonged to the four primary Hindu castes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) are called Savarnas (notice that it is spelled with an uppercase тАШSтАЩ always to indicate superiority) while Dalits and scheduled tribes who did not belong to any caste are called avarnas. The word тАШDalitтАЩ literally means тАШbrokenтАЩ or тАШscatteredтАЩ in Sanskrit. In the 1930s, the word meant тАШdepressed classтАЩ in Marathi and Hindi. The caste system was not always as oppressive as it has been after a few culturally sanctioned laws like from scriptures like the Manusmriti, Vishnu Smriti, and the Atharva Vedas post-2500 B.C. Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in his article titled тАЬThe Rise and Fall of The Hindu Woman,тАЭ pointed out that the root cause of suffering in India was on account of religious scriptures that sanctioned this oppression. For instance, women at large had no right to education, independence, and wealth. This threw Dalit women unarmed and vulnerable against a rigorous patriarchal system. The Manusmriti regards the killing of Dalit women lightly, their lives were a perpetual cycle of humiliation and abuse. And like Dalit woman activist Moni Rani Das, puts it тАЬIf you are not considered human, human rights do not apply to you.тАЭ Systemic crimes In the case of Payal Tadvi, discrimination was very subtle and sophisticated. As a student of medicine, she reported that the professors would not assign her cases to practice her profession, she was not allowed inside the operation theatre and was given a lot of menial jobs to do until the day she decided she had had enough. It was Tuesday the 28th of May last year when she took her life. The incident has whipped up considerable debate and the suicide has been regarded as a тАШState-sponsored crime.тАЩ Institutional casteism begins as soon as the student steps into the school or college through a reservation method. Dalit girls in schools are made to sweep and clean classrooms and corridors and in some anonymous reports, even clean septic tanks. According to the National Commission for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes 2000, about 75% of Dalit girls drop out of primary school despite laws that hold тАШprogressive reservationsтАЩ for Dalit children. Their academic aptitude is usually despised and one of the reasons for their early drop out is an escape from bullying, humiliation, and isolation by classmates, society, teachers, and management. Low literacy is also on account of the lack of educational resources, privatization of schools and colleges, severe poverty, and the demand for an increased dowry for educated girls. Violence More explicit violence has also been the order of the day. Violence is used as a powerful political tool for oppression and the assertion of power. Ruth Manorama, an active member of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights and the National Alliance of Women, once stated that in a male-dominated society, тАЬDalit women face a triple burden of caste, class, and gender.тАЭ Bindu, a 27-year-old Dalit girl from small-town India had refused to take an offer from the son of the town leader. It was 50 rupees (less than $ 1) in return for sex. Her house was set on fire and the familyтАЩs belongings were thrown down the local river. Another 19-year-old named Chanchal was asleep when four men from a dominant caste attacked her and poured acid on her face. Her crime: she was trying to pursue an education. Her face remains severely marred and she reported, тАЬneither the police nor the government seems serious in pushing my case.тАЭ A large number of crimes against Dalit women in modern India go unreported because they are not тАШimportant enoughтАЩ. тАЬ[Dalits] are often victims of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights violations, including sexual abuse and violence. They are often displaced; pushed into forced and/or bonded labour, prostitution, and trafficking,тАЭ wrote Rashida Manjoo, a UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women. When some of them have dared to protest, they are further isolated and threatened of rape, or arson or an acid attack. The women succumb to defending their fragile honour. Bonded Labour Anti-slavery International reports that about 80% of bonded labourers in India are from untouchable or indigenous backgrounds. And the Global Slavery Index shows that India alone accounts for half of the worldтАЩs modern slaves today. The index further cites caste and tribe systems as primary factors that influence the prevalence of modern slavery, zeroing in on Dalit women and children as most vulnerable here. The bigotry in the minds of the dominant caste is both ignorant and deliberate. They assume they can do whatever they please. They feel licensed to go to Dalit houses, rooms, or beds without the fear of law enforcement or a criminal justice system. When the girls or their families consider complaining to the authorities, they get humiliated to the point of despair; just to be тАШtaught a lesson.тАЩ In most cases, Dalit girls feel profoundly isolated as sexual assault survivors. Blaming victims of sexual violence for their own assault is part of a deeply entrenched pattern in our society. тАЬWhy didnтАЩt you scream or fight back?тАЭ or worse, тАЬYou seem to have enjoyed it in silence,тАЭ are things they hear when they find the courage to come out. Just as Nigerian writer, Ijeoma Umebinyou puts it: тАЬYou see in a culture like ours, we were never taught the importance of healing. We were only taught to survive. Not heal, but bury and survive.тАЭ In India as well, the problem breeds more problems, and violence against avarnas is incestuous. How do we fix this? тАЬThey threaten us with rape, jail, even murder. Still, we refuse to be silenced. We found the courage to fight for our rights тАУ surely the world must find the courage to support us,тАЭ Dalit woman human rights defender. Women who apparently escape and find themselves a career and future abroad seem to be better off. In the opening chapter of her book Ants Among Elephants, Dalit writer Gidla writes that years ago at a bar in Atlanta, she told a guy she was an untouchable and he said, тАЬOh, but youтАЩre so touchable.тАЭ It is тАЬa very innocent and strange thing to encounter,тАЭ she later says in an interview, тАЬBut come to India and the encounters plus questions posed to the English-speaking Dalit woman get weirder.тАЭ At home, Dalit women rarely have the latitude to prove merit or exercise creativity and independent judgment. In the case of Gilda at the Jaipur Literature Festival, which is a space of intellectual synergy, she says, тАЬThey didnтАЩt give a shit about me even though I wrote a great book.тАЭ Fixing systemic problems like bigotry and violence that are deeply imbued in courts of justice, education systems, healthcare, and other public spaces cannot be accomplished through a single revolution, however organized it is. Professor Vimal Thorat, the Convenor of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights said, тАЬIn our experience of monitoring violence against Dalit women, the ineffectiveness of criminal justice system compounded by wilful negligence by the police to investigate the cases within the prescribed legal framework is evident.тАЭ Identity politics: The good, the bad, and the struggling Changing the broken casteist and patriarchal system cannot happen merely by the way we talk about women and sex. It doesnтАЩt just start with sexist or casteist beliefs at home. The struggle is larger than personal tragedies, it is a political validation of trauma and oppression. Dalit women have been actively involved in anti-caste and anti-untouchability movements since the 1920s. The self-respect movement, taking from PeriyarтАЩs principles has been effective but unable to put an end to the structural exclusion. Identity politics in this case scenario has helped Dalits re-forge their identity, fight for rights, bring positive changes like taking legal action against caste-based atrocities, political and economic empowerment of Dalit women. While it holds on to the title of being avarna or Dalit, it does so with a subaltern narrative and leverages facts against a system that is steeped with patriarchal and casteist beliefs. The National Federation for Dalit Women was launched by Dalit women and is committed to making a progressive change in a so-called тАШpost-caste era.тАЩ But what lies at stake is their livelihood and survival on a daily basis, therefore, making it impossible for them to organise themselves formally.

In some other places, people of this community are tied to a wooden pole. It should be also noted that in some places, Dalits are found fanning the embers of burning coal and tree bark.

The Constitution House will be introduced at 11:30 am at the Dalit Shakti Kendra, Nani Devti, Sanand Taluka, Ahmedabad district. Those who are likely to join the programme include Bezwada Wilson, the Magsaysay award winning social activist who has been relentlessly fighting for the eradication of manual scavenging; Jyotsna Yagnik, former principal judge, City Civil and Sessions Court, Ahmedabad; Minar Pimple, former senior director, Global Operations, Amnesty International; and Madhusudan Mistry, Rajya Sabha MP, and founder of tribal rights organization Disha. A note on the Constitution House by Navsarjan Trust founder Martin Macwan: Each family needs a House. Many families make a village, city, state and country. The homogeneity makes country the larger family. The country too, therefore needs a House. What does the House do? It gives us security. It protects us from external dangers. It protects us from rains, excessive heat or cold. It creates homogeneity, the feeling of тАШwe are one, we are unitedтАЩ among the family members. The home protects us and makes us feel secured. We too protect the house from corrosion, damage. We clean it every day, and may be twice a day. We repair the roof, we paint the walls, we mend the fence. Be it a cement-brick house or be it a mud or bamboo house. We maintain it and keep it clean and safe. Each adult wants to build both, the family and the house. Years ago, India did not have house of its own. It was enslaved by the British, the French, the Dutch. They came here to do business and slowly claimed Indian soil as their property. We Indians, became тАШtenantsтАЩ in our own house. The тАШtenantsтАЩ do not feel at home in a rented house. Because after all they are тАШtenantsтАЩ and not the тАШownersтАЩ. India then was a home to princely states. It was not a country. How could it be a country when it was not independent and divided into more than 600 princely states? The revolt of 1857 against the British rule was an important milestone in raising national independent consciousness. There were other incidents of revolt in India earlier too. As the uprising grew stronger against the British Rule, the British proposed more rights for Indian тАШsubjectsтАЩ. They promised to design the house for India, a Constitution. However, our freedom fighters told the British to тАШQuit IndiaтАЩ. Said, тАЬwe will build our own house, the way we want, after your departureтАЭ. Came 1947. We became independent and India became an independent country. But before the British departed. They put oil in the fire and promoted communal separation. India was split into two countries. Later two split into three. The family broke. There were many who pushed the idea that the new countries should be designed according to the religious identity of the majority. However, people and leaders of both the countries rejected it. People of all faith continued to live in separated countries. There were violent communal riots all over. And yet, India decided to be тАШSecularтАЩ, a home to people of all religions. Thus came the time for India to design and build its own house, a Constitution. A house that can make all secured and equal. It was not an easy task. India was home to people from different faith. They spoke different languages. They dressed differently. And different was their customs, the food and the culture. We call it diversity. The common among all the difference was the identity, тАШWe are IndiansтАЩ. This identity became the slogan. The slogan was taught to every child in the school. тАШIndia is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sistersтАЩ. Thus began the story of designing the Indian house, the Constitution of India.  Land To build a house, we need a piece of land that we тАШownтАЩ. India now had a land of its own. It owned the land, the rivers, the rivulets, the mountains and valleys, the seas and the sky. Before we start construction and select the location of the house we do consult many people, especially who have seen the past, to check facts as the water levels that left their water marks during major floods etc. We do this, to ensure that our house can survive man natural and human designed calamities. Framers our constitution too had studies Constitutions of various countries. We learnt about the importance of human Liberty, in the backdrop of popular movements against slavery and marginalization of masses such as the French revolution and the struggle for Peach in Ireland. They also learnt about the importance of human rights from the US history of Slavery. Ground-breaking ceremony, the тАШBhoomi PujanтАЩ Before we start the construction, we do the ground-breaking ceremony. People of all faith do the ceremony, as it is more cultural than religious. We clean the land. We dress well, we invite relatives and friends. We declare our intention to build the house. We dream what a house would look like. We agree that along with our family members, the house will be open to birds, the insects, the pets, the plants and the trees. Because, it is the nature that keeps us alive. We promise the nature, that we will protect you. India too had a legal contract with the nature. We will keep our rivers clean. We will protect forest, we will plant trees and water them. We will have a national animal, a national bird, a national fruit, a national flower. After all the birds, the animals, the sunlight, the air, the dust, the water are not property of a country. They do not require passport or visa, to fly, to roam around, to flow, to hum, to shine. They are Independent, beyond human тАШcontrolтАЩ. So India decided to be a home to citizens and the nature. Thus, the ground-breaking ceremony was completed. The Foundation The Foundation has to be deep until it reaches the hard land. The building on soft land may cave in. It has to be wide enough to house a wall, able to bear the weight of the upcoming structure. Once the Foundation is dug, there has to be a layer of brickbats to strengthen the foundation bottom layer over the soil. Brickbats of various sizes are broken into small pieces, They are dumped into foundation and watered before it is crushed until dusted by pounding of spalling hammer. Brickbats resembles our prejudices, of caste, gender, religious sectarianism in the country. Unless they are melted, dusted into a layer of solid concrete-like earth under the foundation wall, the spirit of тАШSecularismтАЩ will not become a reality. The Foundation Wall and Otlo When the Foundation wall, broad, rises above the ground level and up to the plinth, we extend the outer portion to construct an Otta or Otlo. Otlo is used by other community members, who converse and assemble to discuss community matters, or to gossip. Otlo becomes the community talking point. In the times of festivals, we paint Otlo with floral Rangoli designs. In our constitution house, the Otlo welcomes all citizens with a message: тАШIndia is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sistersтАЩ. Every village therefore has a Chora, a common assembly point. True, the challenge remains to ensure that people across differences of Caste and Religion can assemble there.  The Door Over the plinth level wall , we put a concrete band. The band gives strength to the house against earthquakes. The band also does not allow the termite from the ground to enter the home. This band takes the load of the upper structure. The band level also, later, matches the floor level of the house. Over the band, we erect the door frame. The door decides whom to let in and whom not to. In our Constitution, the door represents the guiding principle of EQUALITY. It is open to all the citizens of India, irrespective of caste, race, gender or religion. The award of citizenship in India is not based on Religion. The constitution does not have name of any God or Goddess in its pages. The Windows The windows in our house provides us with oxygen-rich fresh air, and the sunlight. We fix windows on both the opposite walls, cross ventilation, to continue receiving light and air with the change in direction of the earth and wind. The absence of windows would suffocate us and lack of oxygen would depress us. The windows in our Constitution represents Fundamental Rights on one wall. The Fundamental rights are rights which no Government can take away. On the Contrary, it is bounded duty of the State to protect fundamental rights of the citizens. Article 14 guarantees that all citizens are equal before the law and will have equal protection of law. Article 15 says that the State shall not discriminate with any citizen on the grounds of Race, Caste, Sex, Religion or place of Birth. Article 16 guarantees equal opportunity to all in Public employment. Article 17 makes practice of Untouchability, a punishable offense. Article 21 guarantees all citizens right to life with dignity. Merely surviving in dire poverty is not a dignified life. Article 25 gives right to citizens to practice, profess and propagate faith according to their conscience. Whether to believe in religion or not, or to find for what is religious is the right of the citizens and no scriptures can dictate. The windows on the other well provide liberties to the citizens; freedom of thought and expression; liberty to assemble without arms, peacefully, to form associations, to move around the country without obstruction, to reside in any part of the country and to do any profession of choice. No one can be forced to stick to caste based occupations. India has witnessed several riots against reservation. Why reservation when we are all equal, is the argument. The Constitution has an answer. The Constitution provides equality but the inequality in society, economic and social is a reality. We need to create conditions through reservation, to ensure all are equal in true sense. The reservation exists for Dalit, Tribal, OBC and the Women in the fields of Public services, higher education and electoral politics. The Roof Roof is important to the house. It protects us from rain and external damages. The roof needs maintenance. House without roof holds little meaning. The roof in the Constitution resembles to the duties of the citizens. Rights and duties of the citizens are two sides of the coin. If we focus only on the rights and ignore the duties the roof can collapse. Three duties of the citizens are eye-catching and tells us how deeply the Constitution has thought over them. All citizens are asked to transcend narrow religious, linguistic, regional and other divisions and promote harmony and brotherhood. All citizens are asked to renounce practices which are derogatory to dignity of women. All Citizens are asked to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform. We all like to climb over the roof to fly kites especially. The roof also gives us the larger view of our village or area. We feel elevated on the roof. We are proud of our roof. The Constitution is equally proud of the National anthem. When we recite the anthem, the words create images before our closed eyes of India, its mountains, Its rivers, Its ocean, Its people. Original song is longer than we sing and it was composed by Rabindranath Tagore, much before India became independent.  The Minorities In our family we care most for children, the aged and the sick as they are the minority in our family. The constitution of India provides special protection to the Minorities. In India we have defined minorities based on religion and Language. The special protection is to ensure that a section of society on the grounds of being Majority cannot deprive the Minorities. The rights of Minorities include: The right to preserve ones language, script and culture. The right to establish and administer educational institutions and avail State funding without discrimination. The right to admission in State run educational institutions. The Constitution prohibits religious teachings in State aided educational institutions. The Basic House Rules which are Non-negotiable Each family has governing rules for the family to function which are non-negotiable. India too governing rules set up by the Constitution which are non-negotiable for the governance of the Country. These rules or rather the founding principles are the following: Sovereign: We are not slaves. We will make our own laws. We will determine our Policies. Democratic: The Government shall be of the People, for the People and it will be by the People. Socialist: The economy of the country will not be determined and controlled by few, but it will be controlled by all. Water well and food storage: Food and water are basic requirement of the Citizens. They are linked to both, the Policies of the State and the Environment. The Constitution has spelt тАШDirective Principles for State PoliciesтАЩ. The Policies have to be such that they end in fulfilling the rights of the citizens enshrined in the Constitution. While framing these Principles, the Constitution has affirmed that: The Economic Inequality in India is a reality. Everyone does not have land, employment, regular income and asset. The rich have more economic power than the poor. The men has more economic power than women, though it is women who contributes much more labour as compared to men. The Social Inequality in India is a Reality: There are more poor amongst Dalits and Tribal communities because of social realities such as Caste. The aged, the sick, the women and the Minorities are more vulnerable to deprivation. In spite of its wealth, Malnutrition amongst children is a reality. Therefore, what should be the Policies which can eradicate economic and social Inequality? Directive principles are guiding principles for the State to frame Policies. The various programs that have emerged in India, after Independence such as Land re-distribution; Law on Minimum wages, MNREGA, the rights of workers of organized or unorganized sectors, compulsory education until the age of 14, Rights of women in the family property have been rooted in these directive Principles. Directive Principles also focus on access to justice, No citizens be deprived of justice for lack of money; Hence there is Free Legal Aid as a right. The separation of Judiciary from the Executive is ensured. Lastly, there is focus on protection of environment; the land-forest-water and air. The Principles direct us to adopt scientific agriculture and animal husbandry. But, just like in the case of water well, as the water can not rise itself and fill our pots, the Policies and Programs do not walk to our doorsteps. The citizens have to pull the water from the well through handpump. The alertness from the Citizens about their rights requires to be maintained at all the times. The Owners of the House: Who owns the House? The house of Indian Constitution is owned by all its citizens irrespective of their caste, sex, language, religion or region. The Name Plate: Each house has a name plate. A name on the plate that defines and tells the world about the unique identity of the house. The name plate of the house of Indian Constitution is: The Undivided Indian State. Amidst social, linguistic, religious, cultural and linguistic diversities, this is the house of all, UNDIVIDED INDIAN NATION. Therefore there was no other Nation, there is no other Nation and there will be no other Nation. Few Words of the People who Built House: Our fore-parents, who have struggled for their life to build the house, always depart with few words for the next Generation to counsel them. What were the words of framers of Indian Constitution? Dr Ambedkar said: тАЬHowever good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it , happen to be bad lot. However bad a constitution may be, it may turn out to be good, if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.тАЭ Our struggle as citizen continues as expected by the framers of the constitution to ensure that our rights are protected, as attempts to take them away will be a reality.

The vandals reportedly damaged the houses of ArulrajтАЩs (26) parents and siblings, apart from setting afire a couple of bikes. However, Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police Arun Balagopalan told TNIE that the situation was under control and police were keeping the issue from snowballing. Nagulan (6), son of Jaishankar and Revathi of North Muthalapuram, was allegedly strangulated to death by one Arulraj (26) of the same village. While Nagulan belongs to a Dalit community, Arulraj is from a Backward Class community. The boyтАЩs body was found amid bushes on the outskirts of North Muthalapuram on Tuesday. Police said Arulraj, who was drunk during the incident, confessed to having killed Nagulan after the boy mocked him. On Wednesday, NagulanтАЩs relatives allegedly vandalised the houses of ArulrajтАЩs parents, brother and sister. They also damaged the house of ArulrajтАЩs friend, besides setting fire to two vehicles parked in front of ArulrajтАЩs house, sources claimed. Alarmed by the development, people from ArulrajтАЩs community said they grieved for the boy, but found the act of vandalism unethical. Meanwhile, the Superintendent of Police said, тАЬWe are monitoring the situation. We are waiting for a complaint from the victims to register a case.тАЭ Arulraj is a suspect in many theft and robbery cases under Kovilpatti, Masarpatti and Ettayapuram police station limits. He was arrested a few years ago in connection with the murder of a 60-year-old woman. O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

The ancient mosque was razed to the ground in 1992 by the supporters of the BJP in Ayodhya. The Hindutva Right continues to claim that the mosque was built by the Mughal invaders after destroying a temple of Lord Ram, a revered Hindu god. Although it has been well documented that the 1992 incident was the result of a well-planned conspiracy and a culmination of an ongoing agitation for Ram temple by the BJP, the court in UP being governed by the party has ruled in favour of the accused saying this was done by тАЬanti-social elementsтАЭ and exonerating those involved in mobilizing Hindu majority against the mosque for years. Those acquitted are former Deputy Prime Minister of India, L.K. Advani, besides few former union ministers. The verdict comes months after the Indian Supreme Court gave the title of the land to the Hindus even as the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already laid the foundation stone for a grand Ram temple as per the promise made by BJP to the electorate. The question of restoring the land to the Muslims does not arise anymore, especially under Modi, who enjoys a brute majority in the parliament. While the September 30 decision was awaited, a Dalit woman, who was struggling for life in the hospital died after being brutally raped and tortured in UP. 20-year-old Manisha belonged to the so called untouchable community and was being harassed by the men from 'upper caste'. She was assaulted two weeks ago. It has been revealed that the police too tried to shield the suspects and cremated the body of the deceased by keeping her parents away to hush up the evidence. Notably, the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath is notoriously known for giving free hand to the police to kill Muslims in faked encounters after blaming them to be criminals and terrorists, but right under his nose, the police have tried to save those responsible for the rape and murder of a Dalit woman. The two incidents are interlinked in historical sense. The two developments have evoked ugly memories of December 6, 1992, the day when Babri Masjid was pulled down by the mobs. It was also the death anniversary of a towering Dalit icon and a scholar Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Ambedkar had coauthored the Indian constitution that guarantees religious freedom and was a vocal critic of the Hindutva Right that believes in an orthodox caste system that discriminates against Dalits. Ambedkar himself grew up facing blatant discrimination from the 'upper-caste' Hindus and had warned that if ever India becomes a Hindu state it will have a devastating effect. His prophecy was proven right when the Babri Mosque was attacked under a BJP government in UP. It is hard to say whether the BJP goons had purposely picked December 6 as a day of action to send a message to the followers of Ambedkar, but this ugly coincidence was a reminder of what Ambedkar had forewarned about Hindu theocracy. Today, 28 years later that Hindutva privilege has repeated that by exonerating those involved in the demolition and trying to cover up a heinous crime against a Dalit woman. It is like the proverbial killing of two birds (read Muslims and Dalits) with one stone. It shouldnтАЩt surprise anyone how the Muslim haters and casteists have become emboldened under the rule of Modi and Adiyanath. Since they both subscribe to the racist text of Manusmriti тАУ a Hindu text that justifies caste-based atrocities, this was always anticipated in a BJP regime. The Muslims and Dalits have no choice but to revisit Ambedkar and find a way to fight back together instead of fighting separately on the question of religion and caste. These parallels should be an eye-opener for not just these two communities, but everyone considering how attacks on all the religious minorities, and the oppressed groups besides political dissidents have grown ever since Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014. From BJP perspective, they all are enemy aliens, who have been repeatedly othered for both short term electoral gains and to maintain Hindu supremacy.

Appearing for the petitioner, National Council of Dalit Christians, advocates Thomas Franklin Caesar and Gowthaman told a bench of Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant that change in religion does not change social exclusion, and that there was caste discrimination in Christianity too. The Chief Justice remarked that the same argument could be raised in the case of the Muslim community as well, and added that the court will therefore have to hear the matter in detail. The petition wants the court to declare as unconstitutional paragraph (3) of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, which states, тАЬтАжno person who professes a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism and Budhism shall be deemed to be a member of a scheduled caste.тАЭ The plea sought delinking of religion from consideration of Scheduled Caste status, and making the SC category relgion neutral.

On January 17, 2016, a brilliant Hyderabad Central University scholar, Rohith Vemula was pushed to commit suicide and left behind a searing note talking of unfinished dreams and how he felt his тАЬbirth was his fatal accidentтАЭ. Vemula, a Dalit student and a PhD candidate at Hyderabad Central University, had been suspended along with four others, after a complaint by the local unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the BJP. His fellowship was suspended for more than 7 months, for raising тАЬissues under the banner of the ASA. Vemula found it difficult to manage his expenses, and after removing him and the four other students from their hostel rooms, they set up a tent inside the campus and began a relay hunger strike. Not being able to bear the humiliation meted out to them, Vemula lost hope and took his life. Many have called it an тАЬInstitutional MurderтАЭ, as the government machinery was used to settle political scores between two organisations. After his death, the whole country was awakened with his moving last letter. The university and the government has since then tried to focus on VemulaтАЩs caste rather than the cause of the tragedy, claiming that he was not a Dalit. The Ministry of Human Resource Development [MHRD] set up a one-man judicial commission under Justice Ashok Kumar Roopanwal on February 2, 2016, to probe the circumstances that lead to Vemula's suicide. The report was made public on 15th August 2017 and said, that although Vemula was a troubled individual, he was not a Dalit. ""His suicide note is on the record which shows that Rohith Vemula had his own problems and was not happy with worldly affairs,"" it said. ""He was frustrated for the reasons best known to him... He also wrote that he was all alone from childhood and was an unappreciated man. This also indicates his frustration. He did not blame anybody for his suicideтАЭ. The circumstances in the University at the time were not the reason enough for the scholarтАЩs suicide, the probe revealed. In addition, the report indicated that the then HRD minister Smriti Irani and Union Minister Bandaru Dattareya were not responsible for the episode. Even though Vemula had written a letter to the UniversityтАЩs Vice Chancellor, Appa Rao Podile, expressing his anger at the Dalit issues in the varsity as well as the issue of expulsion, the commission concluded that it had nothing to do with his suicide. Regarding the disciplinary action taken in the case of Vemula, Justice Roopanwal's report said: ""In my opinion, the view taken by the Executive Council was the most reasonable one in the circumstances prevailing at that time. The Executive Council mainly focused that the students should concentrate on their academic career and not on other things. The leniency shown by the Executive Council itself shows that the university administration was not functioning under any influence or pressure, otherwise there could be no occasion to be lenient or to reduce the punishment recommended by the Proctorial Board."" The report also said that if he would have been angry with the decision of the university, certainly either he would have written in specific words or would have indicated in this regard. ""Vemula did not do the same. It shows that the circumstances prevailing in the university at that time were not the reasons for committing the suicide."" the report said. Read the full report here. The question that now arises is: Why the commission is discussing Rohith VemulaтАЩs caste? WasnтАЩt it their job to just examine the circumstances and facts which lead to his death and bring the perpetrators, if any, to justice? The commission was mainly created to review the functioning of the grievance committee and had to suggest mechanisms for improvement. Then why do the CommissionтАЩs final findings dedicate four pages out of 12 to whether Rohith was a Dalit? RohithтАЩs letter to the Vice chancellor in December 2016, in which he wrote about the caste discrimination and asked for cyanide and rope for Dalit students, has been completely ignored by the report. Instead, it has questioned the deceasedтАЩs family background and caste. The Commission has observed that the university's equal opportunity cell is not functional. And yet it doesn't explore why the grievance redressal committees are ineffective. Or how they could be made better. 1) Letter dated 10th August, 2015, to Bandaru Dattatreya written by Nandanam Diwakar, brother of Susheel Kumar, Vice President, BJP, Ranga Reddy District. 2) Letter dated 17th August, 2015, from Bandaru Dattatreya, MoS to Smriti Irani, MHRD, detailing his idea of 'Anti-national activities' of ASA. 3) Letter dated 3rd September, 2015 from MHRD office referring to comments by Bandaru Dattatreya, Mos for Labor and Employment. 4) Second Letter from MHRD dated 24th September, 2015, sent as reminder, signed by Deputy Secretary to the Govt of India. 5) Third Letter from MHRD dated 6th October, 2015, signed by Deputy Secretary to the Govt of India. 6) Fourth Letter dated 20th October, 2015, signed by Joint Secretary, MHRD. 7) Fifth Letter from MHRD dated 19th November, 2015, signed by Under Secretary to the Govt of India 8) Rohith VemulaтАЩs letter to the VC, dated 18th December, 2015.","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

The court also imposed a total fine of Rs 26,000 on them. The body of the 30-year old woman with throat slit and stab marks was found in Lingapur mandal of Kumram Bheem-Asifabad district on November 25, 2019, a day after the offence. The three men--Shaik Babu (35), Shaik Shabuddin (50) and Shaik Muqdum (aged around 45), all labourers, were arrested on November 27 and booked under IPC sections 376 (D) (gang rape) and 302 (murder) besides under relevant provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and sent to judicial remand. The second and the third accused were also booked under IPC section 404 (dishonest misappropriation of property). On Thursday, Principal District and Sessions Judge M G Priyadarshini (incharge of the special court) delivered the verdict and convicted the three men under IPC section 302 (murder) and relevant provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and gave death penalty to them, Additional Public Prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. The trio was also sentenced to life imprisonment under IPC section 376 (D), while the second and the third convict were also sentenced to three-years imprisonment under IPC Section 404 for stealing the mobile phone and Rs 200 cash of the deceased. All convictions shall run concurrently. According to the Additional Public Prosecutor, the court held it as the ""rarest of the rare case"" because it was a heinous offence against the woman by not only committing rape and killing her and also fracturing her ribs. The woman was a vendor, selling balloons for a living. Expressing happiness over the verdict, the woman's husband said ""We are happy. Justice has been meted out and we request the court that they should be hanged immediately."" The Telangana government had last month issued orders, designating the Fifth Additional Sessions Court as the special court for speedy trial in the case. On December 14, 2019, a charge sheet was filed and the trial commenced on December 23. Arguments were completed on January 20 and the case was subsequently posted for judgment. As many 25 witnesses were produced by the prosecution which had been demanding capital punishment on the lines of death penalty awarded to the accused in the Nirbhaya gang rape murder case in Delhi. The three accused had earlier pleaded not guilty. Earlier in December, the woman's family and different people's organisations had staged protests and demanded an 'encounter' death for the three men on the lines of the four accused in the 'Disha' (woman veterinarian) gang rape and murder case. The four accused in the veterinarian case were killed in an alleged exchange of fire with police on the outskirts of Hyderabad on December 6, 2019. PTI VVK SS BN SS SS","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

Among the MVA allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has taken the lead to contest the BJPтАЩs тАЬurban naxalтАЭ narrative, with party chief Sharad Pawar pushing for a review of the investigation carried out under the erstwhile BJP governmentтАЩs tenure and questioning the branding of arrested activists as тАЬurban naxalsтАЭ. The Congress, too, has supported this stand openly. However, the Shiv Sena has avoided making any statements on the issue so far. While Pawar has been consistent about his opinion over the Bhima-Koregaon probe, there is also a clear political angle to this stand: It is a bid to reach out to the Dalit community that has been patently unhappy with the BJP. The majority of the community, which makes up 13% of the stateтАЩs population, is currently split between the Congress-NCP combine and Dalit leader Prakash AmbedkarтАЩs Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), even as BJP ally, Republican Party of IndiaтАЩs Ramdas Athawale continues to enjoy some support base among Dalits in urban areas. AmbedkarтАЩs outfit, which was formed after the Bhima-Koregaon violence, damaged the Congress-NCP allianceтАЩs prospects in both the Lok Sabha as well as the Vidhan Sabha polls. If not for VBA, the BJP might not have touched 100-seat mark in the state Assembly polls. With the National Investigation Agency (NIA) now taking over the probe into the Bhima-Koregaon violence, the MVA governmentтАЩs stand against the Centre is likely to win it support from Dalits in the state. And, the BJP, which is aware of this, is digging its heels to show that the investigations carried out under its government were on the dot as they uncovered a Maoist conspiracy that has repercussions for the country. тАЬThis government, especially the NCP, is clearly reaching out to the Dalits with its explicit stand against the тАШurban naxalтАЩ narrative. The party is looking at expansion in Vidarbha, where such a stand will help it expand its base. It will also help the NCP earn lost foothold in cities like Mumbai. The NCP leadersтАЩ statements point to a well-coordinated strategy to corner the BJP on this issue and shore support of Dalits,тАЩтАЩ said political analyst Hemant Desai. Pawar, as well as state home minister Anil Deshmukh, have questioned the haste with which NIA took over the Bhima-Koregaon inquiry. тАЬWhy the haste just when the state was looking at setting up an SIT? ItтАЩs because of the fear of being exposed. They are afraid the truth will come out,тАЩтАЩ said Pawar, while speaking to reporters in Mumbai on Saturday. The violence on January 1, 2018, occurred when Dalits had gathered near the war memorial to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle, in which the British army, led by the Mahar regiment, won against the ruling Peshwas. The violence had sparked Dalit protests and a bandh across the state. The police investigations under the Fadnavis regime, had pointed to a Maoist conspiracy and led to the arrest of several activists with purported Maoist links. It had also led to alienation of the Dalit community as no action was taken against Hindu hardline leaders like Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, who, Dalit leaders had alleged, were responsible for the violence. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, meanwhile, backed the NIA probe and said the MVA government was indulging in politics of votes. тАЬMaharashtra Police had investigated this case in great detail to uncover the network of тАШurban naxalsтАЩ. Charge sheets have been framed. Despite this, the government, in a bid to play politics of votes, questioned this probe,тАЩтАЩ he said. тАЬI think the decision to give it to the NIA is correct. The Maharashtra investigations had shown that the тАШurban naxal networkтАЩ is spread across India.тАЭ тАШMAHA MAY CONDUCT OWN PROBEтАЩ State energy minister Nitin Raut said the state may not cooperate with the Centre, and may conduct its own probe. тАЬWe will take a call in the next cabinet meeting. We may not cooperate with NIA and launch a probe by the Maha SIT,тАЭ he said, adding BJP has a тАЬgrudgeтАЭ against those who organised Elgar Parishad. тАЬHow can anyone call retired justices BG Kolse-Patil and PB Sawant, who were the main organisers urban naxals? If you criticise the govt, you become naxals for them [BJP]. They are taking country towards autocracy,тАЭ he added.

Dhanprasad Ahirwar (24) was doused with kerosene in Dharmshri Colony, some 170 kilometres from here, on January 14 allegedly by four people who wanted him to take back a police complaint. All four, identified as Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan, were arrested. Ahirwar, who sustained 70 percent burns, was initially treated in Sagar, then shifted to a hospital in Bhopal, and later air-lifted to a facility in New Delhi where he succumbed on January 23. Addressing a protest rally here, former chief minister and senior BJP leader Shivarj Singh Chouhan said a mob of 20- 25 people had set Ahirwar on fire. ""These persons also wanted to kill Ahirwar in 2019 but police did not take action. It was the government's duty to arrest the accused but it did not touch them because they belong to a minority community. The voice of a poor Dalit was not heard,"" Chouhan alleged. He said crimes against Dalits were rising in MP under the Kamal Nath dispensation and the party's high command, comprising Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi would have to answer. He asked if the Gandhi family would come to Sagar to meet the kin of the deceased. State BJP chief Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had approached police three times claiming that his life was in danger but the police did nothing. He said the state government should give Rs 25 lakh as compensation to Ahirwar's family as well as a job..

Dhanprasad Ahirwar was doused in kerosene and set on fire by his neighbours Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan, and is battling for life in Bhopal's Hamidia Hospital with over 70 per cent burns, Motinagar police station in charge Sangita Singh said on Saturday. Ahirwar had filed a police complaint over a dispute and the accused were forcing him to take it back, Singh said, adding that Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan had been arrested. Leader of Opposition in the MP Assembly Gopal Bhargava visited Ahirwar in Hamidia Hospital and claimed crimes against Dalits were increasing under the Kamal Nath government. State BJP president Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had told police three times that his life was in danger but he got no help from the authorities. He said police did not act on Ahirwar's apprehensions because of the Congress-led government's vote-bank politics and policy of appeasement. ""Though 15-20 people set Ahirwar on fire, only four have been arrested. This is because of appeasement,"" he added. The MP Congress, meanwhile, hit out at the BJP and said it was giving a communal colour to every issue. ""The BJP needs to change its perception of seeing communal politics in every issue. This is a criminal case and the police have arrested the accused immediately,"" MP Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said..

Women and Child Welfare Minister Pramila Mallick entered the sanctum sanctorum of the Akhandalamani temple, a shrine of Lord Shiva at Aradi village in Bhadrak district, some 150 km from Bhubaneswar. Temple chief priest Gokulananda Panda said they performed the purification ritual because Dalits were not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. The priests closed the temple for over an hour and washed it soon after the minister left, Panda said. Mallik said she had visited the temple along with her family but didn't know if purification ritual was performed following her entry. Dalits in Orissa are barred from entering many Hindu temples.

A bench, headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, issued notice to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, the National Commission for Minorities and the Registrar General of India and sought the Centre's response within two weeks, as it tagged the plea with other similar matters. The plea also sought the Scheduled Castes community should be made religion neutral. According to the plea, a Scheduled Caste person admitting a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism should not be deprived from the benefit by Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, which restricts Christians of Scheduled Castes origin from availing the Scheduled Castes status. This restriction is against the fundamental right to equality, religious freedom and non-discrimination, it said. The plea sought allowing and extending the Scheduled Castes status to Christians of Scheduled Castes Origin for availing special privilege in education, scholarships, employment, welfare measures, panchayat elections, legislative assemblies up to Indian Parliament and for availing the legal remedy/protection under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention) of Atrocities Act, 1989 amended in the year 2018. The court was hearing the plea filed by the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC) seeking Scheduled Caste status for Dalit Christians. ""The non-inclusion of Christians in Paragraph (3)A of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, along with Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism, is discriminatory and violative of Articles 14, 15, 16 and 25 of the Constitution"", said the plea. The plea said social exclusion does not disappear with the change in and caste hierarchy continues to exist within Christianity, despite the religion forbidding it.IANS ┬й Copyright The Weekend Leader.com, 2021.

At the time of writing this essay, she was merely 14 years old and a student at the school run by Jotirao and Savitribai Phule (Jotirao Phule, Ambedkar and others have written plainly about the plight of IndiaтАЩs Shudras-Atishudras тАУ how much they have suffered due to the brahmanical system; how they have been forced to live like animals. But Mukta Salve gives us the perspective of a 14-year-old Dalit girl on this oppression. This first female Dalit writer vented her anger 165 years ago, in an essay she wrote for the Marathi fortnightly Gyanodaya. It was published in two parts under the title тАШMang Maharachya DukhvisayiтАЩ. The first part was published on 15 February 1855 and the second part on 1 March 1855. On this special occasion, we republish below Braj Ranjan ManiтАЩs English translation of the essay. ) It humbles me to realize that God has filled the heart of an untouchable girl like me, considered to be even lower than an animal, with the pain and suffering of my people тАУ the Mahars and Mangs. The Creator of all beings has put this in my heart and while invoking His name, I dare to pen this essay with the strength I have now received. The Creator is the one who created the Mangs, the Mahars and also the Brahmans and He is the one, who is filling me with wisdom to write. He will bless my labour with a fruitful outcome.  If we attempt to refute, on the basis of the Vedas, the argument of these gluttonous Brahmans, who hate us and consider themselves vastly superior, they say that the Vedas are their own domain, their exclusive property. Now apparently, if the Vedas are only for the Brahmans, they are obviously not for us. If the Vedas belong only to the Brahmans, then it is an open secret that we do not have the Book. We are without the Book тАУ we are without any religion. If the Vedas are for the Brahmans only, then we are not bound to act according to the Vedas. If merely looking at the Vedas can get us into grievous sins (as the Brahmans claim), then would not following them be the height of foolishness? Muslims lead their life according to their Koran, English people follow their Bible and Brahmans have their own Vedas. Because they all have their own good or bad religion that they follow, they are somewhat happier than us who are without any religion. Oh, God, please tell us, what is our religion? Teach us, O God, your true religion so that we all can lead our lives according to it. Let that religion, where only one person is privileged and the rest deprived, vanish from the earth and let it never enter our minds to boast of such a [discriminatory] religion. Mukta Salve These people drove us, the poor Mangs, and Mahars, away from our own lands, which they occupied to build large buildings. And that was not all. They would make the Mangs and Mahars drink oil mixed with red lead and bury our people in the foundations of their buildings, thus wiping out generation after generation of our poor people. The Brahmans have degraded us so low; they consider people like us even lower than cows and buffaloes. Did they not consider us even lower than donkeys during the rule of Bajirao Peshwa? You beat a lame donkey, and his master retaliates. But who was there to object to the routine thrashing of Mahars and Mangs? Under BajiraoтАЩs rule, if any Mang or Mahar happened to pass in front of a gymnasium, they would cut off his head and play тАЬbat and ballтАЭ with their swords as bats and his head as a ball, on the grounds. When we were punished for even passing by their doors, where was the question of getting education, getting freedom to learn? When any Mang or Mahar would learn somehow to read and write, and if Bajirao came to know about this, he would say: education of a Mang or Mahar amounts to taking away a BrahmanтАЩs job. He used to say, тАЬHow dare they get educated? Do these Untouchables expect the Brahmans to hand over their official duties to them and move around with their shaving kits, shaving the heads of widows?тАЭ With such remarks he would punish them. An image of Mukta SalveтАЩs piece on the pages of 15 February 1855 issue of тАШGyanodayaтАЩ Secondly, were these Brahmans satisfied with prohibiting us from learning? Not at all. Bajirao went to Kashi and died an ignominious death there. But the mahars here, no less untouchable than the Mangs, also avoid the company of the Mangs. They have acquired some brahmanical traits, and consider themselves to be superior to the Mangs тАУ they also get polluted by the shadow of Mangs! Do the stony-hearted Brahmans, who proudly roam around in their so-called holy clothes to proclaim their superiority, ever feel even a frisson of compassion for us when we suffer so much on account of being labelled Untouchables? Nobody gives us employment because we are Untouchables. No job means no money. We have to endure grinding poverty. O learned pandits, fold up your selfish priestcraft and stop the prattle of your hollow wisdom and listen to what I have to say. When our women give birth to babies, they do not have even a roof over their heads. How they suffer in the rain and the cold! Please try to understand it from your own experience. If they get some disease while giving birth, where will they get money for the doctor or medicines? Was there ever any doctor among you who was human enough to treat such people free of cost? The masthead of the 15 February 1855 issue of тАШGyanodayaтАЩ The Mang and Mahar children never dare lodge a complaint even if the Brahman children throw stones at them and injure them seriously. They suffer silently because they know they have to go to the BrahmansтАЩ houses to beg for the leftover food. Alas! O God! What agony this! I will burst into tears if I write more about this injustice. Because of such oppression, the merciful God has bestowed on us, this benevolent British government. Let us see how our pain has been mitigated under this government. Earlier, Gokhale, Apate, Trimkaji, Andhala, Pansara, Kale, Behre, etc [all Brahman surnames], who showed their bravery by killing rats in their homes, persecuted us, not sparing even pregnant women, without any rhyme or reason. This has stopped now. Harassment and torture of Mahars and Mangs, common during the rule of Peshwas in Pune, have stopped. Now, human sacrifice for the foundation of forts and mansions has stopped тАУ now, nobody buries us alive. Now, our population is growing in numbers. Earlier, if any Mahar or Mang wore fine clothes, they would say that only Brahmans should wear such clothes. Seen in fine clothes, we were earlier accused of stealing such clothes. Their religion was in danger of being polluted when Untouchables put clothes around their bodies; they would tie them to a tree and punish them. But, under British rule, anybody with money can buy and wear clothes. Earlier, punishment for any wrongdoing against the upper castes was to behead the guilty UntouchableтАФ now, it has stopped. Excessive and exploitative tax has stopped. The practice of untouchability has stopped in some places. Killing has stopped on the playground. Now, we can even visit the marketplace. Under the impartial British rule, many such things have happened. As I write this, I am amazed that the Brahmans who earlier used to treat us like dirt, as I have written above, want to free us from our suffering. Not all the Brahmans though. Those who are influenced by Satan continue to hate us like before. They target and outcaste the Brahmans who are trying to liberate us. Some noble souls have started schools for Mahars and Mangs, and such schools are supported by the merciful British government. O, the Mahars and Mangs, you are poor and sick. Only the medicine of knowledge will cure and heal you. It will take you away from wild beliefs and superstitions. You will become righteous and moral. It will stop your exploitation. People who treat you like animals, will not dare to treat you like that any more. So please work hard and study. Get educated and become good human beings. But I cannot even prove this. For example, those who have received good education also sometimes surprise us by doing very bad deeds! Mukta Salve was a student at the school run by Jotirao and Savitribai Phule. At merely 14 years of age, she wrote an essay about the plight of the Mangs and the Mahars and the way to relieve it. The essay was published in the Marathi magazine 'Gyanodaya' Savitribai PhuleтАЩs letters are still relatively unknown. They demonstrate her concerns for society, love for humanity, revolt against injustices, anger against the casteist mindset and hope for building an egalitarian society, writes Siddharth рдХрдо рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рдХрд╛ рд╣реА рдзреНрдпрд╛рди рд╕рд╛рд╡рд┐рддреНрд░реАрдмрд╛рдИ рдлреБрд▓реЗ рдХреЗ рдкрддреНрд░реЛрдВ рдкрд░ рдЬрд╛рддрд╛ рд╣реИред рд╕рд┐рджреНрдзрд╛рд░реНрде рд▓рд┐рдЦрддреЗ рд╣реИ рдХрд┐ рд╕рд╛рд╡рд┐рддреНрд░реАрдмрд╛рдИ рдлреБрд▓реЗ рдХреЗ рдкрддреНрд░реЛрдВ рдореЗрдВ рд╡реНрдпрд╛рдкрдХ рд╕рдорд╛рдЬ рдХреА рдЪрд┐рдВрддрд╛, рдЗрдВрд╕рд╛рдирд┐рдпрдд рдХреЗ рдкреНрд░рддрд┐ рдЧрд╣рд░реЗ рдкреНрд░реЗрдо, рдЕрдиреНрдпрд╛рдп рдХреЗ рдкреНрд░рддрд┐ рддреАрдЦреЗ рд╡рд┐рджреНрд░реЛрд╣, рдЬрд╛рддрд┐рд╡рд╛рджреА рдорд╛рдирд╕рд┐рдХрддрд╛ рдХреЗ рдЦрд┐рд▓рд╛рдл рдЖрдХреНрд░реЛрд╢ рдФрд░ рд╕рдорддрд╛-рдЖрдзрд╛рд░рд┐рдд рд╕рдорд╛рдЬ рдХреА рдЖрд╢рд╛рдПрдВ рдЕрднрд┐рд╡реНрдпрдХреНрдд рд╣реИрдВ Those who have termed the revolt of 1857 as the first war for IndiaтАЩs independence are the fools who wanted freedom for the Hindus alone.

Two Dalit brothers, accused of theft, were beaten up and tortured allegedly by staff at a petrol station in Rajasthan on Sunday, police said. A disturbing video of the assault has emerged that shows several men beating up one of them at the petrol station at a village in Nagaur, about 230 km from Jaipur. The 24-year-old had gone to the filling station with his cousin, who is also in his early twenties. In the clip, some men are seen stripping him, violating him with a screw driver. They allegedly poured petrol on his genitals. A first information report was filed on Wednesday after the two brothers approached the cops.  ""The two men, accused of theft on Sunday, were brutally thrashed by the employees. The assault was recorded on camera and the video went viral. They filed a police complaint on Wednesday,"" senior police officer Rajpal Singh said. Seven men have been arrested so far, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted.

Pressure is growing from his supporters to turn the Bhim Army into a political party. According to many in his inner circle, he could launch a new national party as early as in March 2020. But given that his inner circle is very large, it is difficult to separate legend and nail facts. For instance, he has a blood condition which requires him to undergo Phlebotomy every fortnight. The process involves drawing blood out of his system to prevent it from thickening and causing a heart attack. The legend, however, is simply that тАШRavan produces too much blood when he is angryтАЩ.

The othering is not limited to estrangement but graduates to violence, exclusion and repeated oppression. Newer strategies are plotted 24X7 by the upper castes to form a para-structure in order to remove them from positions of power which they see as their privilege. A person with dominant caste roots already carries a privilege of thousands of years. Added to that, various institutions that exist cater to their needs. This results in an archetype that is naturalised as pan-India, with a language, food, culture and social set-up that actually discounts the everydayness of a majority of India that comprises the Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims as well as backward classes. India is a Brahminical State, notwitstanding its secular nature. The entire system favours the twice-born savarnas, mostly Brahmins who occupy the highest position by default in all the major sectors, controlling wealth and power. If Brahmins and other savarnas enjoy these ill-gotten privileges without much question, why do they indulge in the sadistic act of forcing psychological and physical pain upon powerless subjects who they see as their serfs? Almost every Brahminical festival or celebration is anti-Dalit, and to an extent anti-Adivasi. The asuras (demons) occupy a special place, whether it is Ravana or Mahishasur, while the devas are fair-skinned Aryans. Opinion | Christina Dhanaraj writes: How Babasaheb helped me understand my identity as a Dalit-Christian Imagine living in a country where one worries constantly about oneтАЩs immediate security and safety. Handicapped by these immediate threats, the Dalits are unable to rise to their full potential. Raising a child for the Dalits under such circumstances is mortifying. So, what are the ways that the Dalits can be safe and secure enough to enjoy the fruits of a Constitution that guarantees them freedom? If hatred is such, one needs to ask if this country is even equipped to consider the Dalits as fellow, equal citizens? Babasaheb Ambedkar himself was highly sceptical of the social and economic inequalities which persist, warning that these would engender serious problems. This scepticism led him to suggest several methods for Dalit security. Ambedkar concluded that the Indian habitat was a dangerous place for the Dalits. He mooted separate settlements as one solution, which would bind the Dalits together and make them economically autonomous. Social divisions might operate in these settlements too, and there is a fear that this might see a repeat of the experiences of the Bantus in Africa. Separate settlements ended up depriving them of basic infrastructure. Opinion | Suraj Yengde writes: Hindu, Muslim, and the nonsense of it However, such fears present only an incomplete picture, as such settlements would ensure that the Dalits are not subordinates, nor merely secondary Hindus. For, I argue that Hindu India is not mentally prepared to grant equal citizenship to everyone. It lives in the fear of Others. There may be cascades of generational violence should the Dalits start replying in equal fervour. However, can the rest of India survive without them? Who will do the filthy work it has made it the sole privilege of these untouchables? Drafting Ambedkar into the Constituent Assembly was hence a good gamble. It made the Dalits nationalists in a country where no one else actually stands to defend their rights. In recently published research, Amit Thorat and Omkar Joshi say untouchability is still an everyday reality for the Dalits, with 20 per cent of urban and 30 per cent of rural India accepting that they practise it. The numbers may be far more as the information collected by the research was voluntary, with much reluctance seen in urban areas to provide answers. Half of India openly accepted acts of caste criminality. In the same research, on almost all aspects of untouchability, the Brahmins led from the front. AmbedkarтАЩs desires are yet to be fulfilled as his people continue to live his worst fears.

"72",725,"https://www.thequint.com/videos/caa-nrc-protests-violence-bjp-govt-dalit-documents","Manoranjan Byapari dalit activist├В┬а interview with The Quint on Anti CAA NRC protests in India. Byapari says that Anti CAA NRC Protests to continue for long.","This fight will go on because such an insensitive government & politicians have never been there in our country. Author and activist Manoranjan Byapari minces no words when talking to The Quint about the ongoing anti-CAA protests across the country. Unlike many political leaders, who seem to have taken a comfortable stand on the amended citizenship act, Byapari refuses to be taken in by the assurances given by the BJP government. He shares how the protests are not going anywhere soon and how the the government may resort to violence to subdue them. Below is an excerpt from the conversation:  On Ongoing Anti CAA-NRC Protests  People are expressing dissent against CAA-NRC in Kolkata. Everyday a procession is being taken out. Students, youngsters and mostly women; particularly women from the Muslim community who have never stepped out of their houses, even they have started coming out of their houses now and are taking part in the protest. It is very clear that the government will not bow down to these protests. They will have to employ the use of machine guns and air bombs, before which this stops. This fight has just taken off. This fight will go on in the future too. This is because such an insensitive government and politicians have never been in our country before. They donтАЩt know the value of the lives of people. They will stretch themselves to the extreme, from where they will either lose or win. If they win, then it will be a deadly day, not just for Indians but for humans as a race. If humans (protesters) are able to win then it will pave the way for a new society.  On BJP GovernmentтАЩs Assurances With Respect to CAA-NRC  You transformed into a snake and bit us and now you say that you will provide us with first-aid for the same. Why did you bring forth this bill in the year 2003? This bill was brought in by you. Before this people had Voter Card, Aadhar Card, Pan Card and some even had passports. It was through their votes that you came to power. Today you are standing against it saying that all these documents hold no value and you will create new papers and give them to people which will prove whether one is a citizen. So, somewhere or the other it shows that you have something else going on in your mind. A lot like the saying that elephantтАЩs tooth is different to see and entirely different to chew. Bangladesh will not accept us and you say that we donтАЩt belong here. So, you think we have been dropped from the skies here? Where has our country gone? You tell us where to stay, then. You are creating detention camps for us and telling us that we have to stay there. We will not accept this. So many people have come on the streets and they donтАЩt want to go to detention camps.  On Mamata Banerjee  Look, up until now her stand has been appreciation worthy. But she is the Chief Minister and we never know as to when she changes her stance to what and where, no one can tell. The common man has waged a war with the government. The common man has taken to the streets. As you are already seeing the poor vote percent that CPM gets. But when they take out the procession, lakhs of people take part in it. These people who take part in the procession are not from CPM, they are the ones who are against this law. They are standing up and fighting the war. Any party which disassociates themselves from these processions will lose the support of the common man.  On Mayawati and Chandrashekhar  Now that MayawatiтАЩs name has come into the pictureтАФshe was elected as the Chief Minister by the Dalits. Then why have the Dalits turned against her? This means that you have not been able to fall through to her expectations and that is why people have lost their trust in you. Now, Mayawati is not even outrightly rejecting this Law because CBI is after her. She is scared that if she stands against them then she will be sent to the gallows. So, she is not able to speak as openly as Chandrashekhar Azad aka Ravan is able to. He is not scared of speaking. Mayawati is scared of speaking as she saw how things panned out for Lalu Prasad Yadav. Somewhere or the other these people have done something or the other which is causing them to be scared of CBI and SIT. That is why these people have not been able to openly protest against it. They also feel the need to ask as to how long must they protest? As long as they get permission enough to roast their political bread, they protest. Just stating that she is a messiah and a revered minister of the Dalit community is wrong. If you look closely, you will find out that more than half of the leadership actually belongs to the upper castes. Therefore, it is no longer a question of what she is doing. It is a question of what the people are doing. (At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience. Play an active role in shaping our journalism by becoming a member.

In a shocking incident, a 24-year-old Dalit man was lynched near Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, when he squatted by the road to defecate, his family alleged. The incident took place on Wednesday, and the police on Friday arrested seven people after videos of the torture began circulating, reported The Indian Express. Preliminary reports suggested that Sakthivel belongs to the SC Adi Dravida community, a Dalit caste and the village where he was attacked is dominated by Vanniyars, a socially powerful OBC community in Tamil Nadu. There have been several such similar incidents in the past. A case has been registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with IPC Section 302 (punishment for murder). An allegation that has surfaced now is that Sakthivel was beaten for allegedly flashing at a woman, the report said. A senior police officer told The Indian Express that a few villagers had seen the victim remove his pants fully before squatting on the roadside, which allegedly startled a woman walking by. She narrated to the publication that Sakthivel had finished his night duty at the petrol pump and reached home on Wednesday morning. He had received a call from his colleagues, asking him to come with his documents for some official verification. He ran out of fuel on the way and had informed his family, he was also not feeling well and тАШsaid he would sit by the roadside to defecate.тАЩ In some time, the family received a call from some man who said Sakthivel was tied up and that he was in their custody at Boothur Hills. Theivanai rushed to the location with a relative on a two-wheeler and her six-month-old baby. She found Sakthivel bleeding profusely from his mouth and nose, and saw over 15-20 people kicking him to the ground, reported The Times of India. Police allegedly reached only two hours after the violence began. The family managed to get him out of there and it was only after they reached home, did they realise that Sakthivel had passed away. Villupuram SP D Jayakumar told The Indian Express, that they are probing the caste angle to the murder. (WIth inputs from The Times of India and The Indian Express.)

Photo: By arrangment Jaipur: In what seems to be yet another case of custodial death, a day after a Dalit man in RajasthanтАЩs Barmer was picked up by the police, who accused him of having stolen property in his possession, he was reported dead on Thursday. The family of the deceased has accused the police of murder. Jitender Khatik alias Jitu, a 26-year-old man who owns a scrap shop was detained by the Barmer (rural) police on Wednesday, who alleged that a тАЬpipeтАЭ in his possession was stolen property. KhatikтАЩs brother Champalal told The Wire that the family had shown the police a receipt for the pipe to prove that it wasnтАЩt stolen. тАЬBut still they took my brother away.

When KhatikтАЩs family went to the station in the evening along with the bill, the police told them he would be released the next morning. тАЬIn the night, we took food for him. In the morning too, at around 9 am, we took tea for him and met him. He didnтАЩt say much but his eyes were swelling and he looked very tired.

He is survived by a wife and a five-year-old son.

A screenshot from the video of the attack. Jaipur: After two Dalit boys in RajasthanтАЩs Nagaur were brutally assaulted and filmed, activists have alleged that the state police, after registering their FIR, encouraged the accused to file a counter-FIR under charges of theft against the victims. The time of registration of the counter-FIRs circumstantially supports their claim. The Wire accessed copies of the FIRs: the family of the boys filed an FIR numbered #11 at the Panchaudi police station in Nagaur against the accused for assault and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act on February 19 at 3:10 pm. The accused subsequently filed FIR #12 against the victims for theft 44 minutes later, at 3:54 pm. тАЬThe Dalit identity of the boys gave the mob a sort of licence to beat them mercilessly,тАЭ B.L. Bhati, president of the Ambedkar Welfare society in Nagaur, told The Wire. тАЬIf the mob had beaten up the boys for so-called theft, then why were they not the first to register an FIR? It was the police who encouraged the accused to file an FIR against the boys.тАЭ He also claimed one of the accused, who owned a motorbikes agency, offered Rs 40,000 to the victimтАЩs father in front of the police to not file an FIR. The accused are named Bhiv Singh, Aidan Singh, Jassu Singh, Sawai Singh, Hanuman Singh, Ganpat Ram and Laxman Singh. According to the police, all seven have been arrested. Local residents also accused the station house officer of favouring the accused as they belonged to his caste. тАЬThe police in-charge and the accused are of the same caste,тАЭ Prithvi Singh Meghwal, a resident who was present with the family at the police station, told The Wire. тАЬThatтАЩs why he was pressurising the family to settle the matter without an FIR but [the family] stood firm.тАЭ However, the station house officer of the Panchaudi police station, Rajpal Singh, said they had asked the victims to register an FIR, not the accused. тАЬ[The victims] were not willing to register an FIR against the matter. So after the video went viral, we asked them to register an FIR,тАЭ he told The Wire. тАЬSoon after, the accused also came out to register an FIR against the victim. How could we stop anyone who wants to register an FIR?тАЭ On February 16, the young men, named Vissa Ram (23) and Panna Ram (18), both residents of Sonnagar in Nagaur, had visited an automobile repair shop named Om Automobile Hero agency about 5 km from their home. There, they were attacked by the shop owner and other staff after some amount of money was found missing from a safe. The assaulters grabbed the boys and inserted a screwdriver dipped in petrol into the young menтАЩs private parts. Frightened, the young men returned home and didnтАЩt utter a word about the assault. The family only came to know of the incident after three days when the video of the violence went viral. Bhura Ram, Vissa RamтАЩs brother, said, тАЬHis elder brother recognised him in the video and informed us. We then asked the boys what had happened that day. As we got to know about it, we went straight to the police to report it. [The police] kept us waiting until afternoon and then registered an FIR.тАЭ However, he refused to speak against the police. тАЬIn matters of caste atrocities, the victims are often pressurised to keep their mouth shut,тАЭ Bhati said. тАЬIn this case, too, the victims are turning hostile because of the indulgence of politicians.тАЭ The police registered an FIR against the accused under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) and 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act. In their counter-FIR, the accused have claimed that the two Dalit men came to their shop at lunch time and, when nobody was looking, broke the safe and stole Rs 50,000. Ten minutes after they left, the shopтАЩs owner discovered the safe was broken and, after checking the CCTV footage, determined one of the duo had stolen money from the safe. тАЬWe had recognised them in the CCTV footage so we went to search them in the village and found the two at the nearby circle.

In a fresh case, a Dalit groom, who is serving in the Indian Army, was not allowed to ride a mare on his wedding day in Gujarat. The groom and the wedding party (baraat) was pelted with stones when it was proceeding to the wedding venue in the state's Banaskantha district. What was shocking was that the miscreants from another community attacked the wedding party despite police protection being provided to the groom. Open threats to Dalit family According to a report in Indian Express, the incident took place on January 16 (Sunday) at Sharifda village when the 22-year-old groom identified as Akash Kumar Koitiya began his wedding procession. Koitiya has just finished his training with the military police and was scheduled to deploy in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh. The jawan was on leave for his wedding. The groom's family said they had received threats from the Thakor Koli community not to pass the wedding procession through the village if the jawan rode a mare. ""After threats, we had requested police to give us protection. Police gave us 6-7 personnel for the security of the wedding procession. As we started to move, some people started to throw stones at us. The groom barely escaped injuries and was rushed to a police van. However, three persons including two women sustained injuries in the stone-pelting,"" said Vijay Koitita, the groom's brother. The groom's family had received threats in advance from the upper caste if the youth rode the mare (Representative image) Police protection to groom Vijay is also an army man and is currently deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. After the attack, a number of policemen were rushed to the village.

Seven people, including three women, have been arrested in Tamil NaduтАЩs Villupuram district on charges of lynching a 24-year-old Dalit youth after he defecated by a village road, The Indian Express reported on Sunday. The attack occurred on Wednesday in a village dominated by Vanniyars, a powerful Other Backward Class community in north and north-western Tamil Nadu. The victim was identified as R Sakthivel from Karai village. He worked at a petrol pump. The accused were arrested on Friday after videos of the lynching were circulated in the area. SakthivelтАЩs sister claimed it was a caste murder. тАЬOn Tuesday, he was on night duty at the petrol pump and reached home on Wednesday morning,тАЭ R Theivanai told the newspaper. тАЬLater, he received a call from his colleagues, asking him to come with his Aadhaar card and a photo for some official verification. When he left home around 1.30 pm, he mentioned how there was only a little petrol in his two-wheeler.тАЭ Sakthivel later called his sister to inform her that he had run out of petrol, and added he would defecate by a road. Soon after, Theivanai received a call from her brotherтАЩs phone. An unidentified man told her that a mob had tied up Sakthivel. тАЬHe asked me to reach Boothur Hills [about 5 km from their home],тАЭ she added. тАЬIt was clear there was some problem.тАЭ When Theivanai reached the spot, she saw 15 to 20 people had gathered around her brother. тАЬWhen I reached, they beat him some more,тАЭ she added. тАЬI tried to stop them and pleaded for help, but they kicked me and my child fell to the ground. Sakthivel could hardly talk but he signalled to me to leave with the child.тАЭ The police reportedly arrived two hours late, and directed Sakthivel and Theivanai to go home. By then Sakthivel was unconscious, and was pronounced dead by doctors at a nearby hospital. The village residents, however, contradicted the familyтАЩs versions of events. They claimed that Sakthivel was attacked for flashing at a woman. A police officer said the victim completely removed his jeans before defecating, reported The News Minute. тАЬA woman working on a site nearby saw him and thought he was flashing,тАЭ the officer added. тАЬWe are probing further.тАЭ Theivanai denied the allegations, and reiterated it was a caste attack. тАЬAfter the mob caught him, they checked his Aadhaar card and noted his caste name,тАЭ she claimed. тАЬWhile attacking him, they kept abusing him and calling out our caste name.тАЭ District Superintendent of Police D Jayakumar said there would be a detailed investigation to ascertain if there was a caste angle to the attack. тАЬHe died of heart attack due to the severe torture,тАЭ Jayakumar added. тАЬA case has been registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with Indian Penal Code Section 302 [punishment for murder].тАЭ","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

Bhopal/Mandsaur: A Dalit law student has appealed to the Supreme Court for legislation to stop family members of lawmakers and bureaucrats from getting the benefits of reservation. The development comes against the backdrop of a swirling debate on the quota system in the country, particularly after the SC ruled this month that there is no fundamental right to reservations in appointments and promotions under articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. The petitioner, 25-year-old Vikram Kumar Bagde, a native of Madhya PradeshтАЩs Neemuch town, is also of the view that just like people can voluntarily give up cooking gas and rail travel subsidy, the resourceful section of the reserved categories should have the option to forgo the benefits to ensure the 80% deprived community members can take much-needed advantage. Bagde, whose father is a peon, says he never availed caste reservation after clearing class XII, made it through the law entrance examination as a general category candidate, and is currently a first-year LLB student in Rajiv Gandhi College, Mandsaur. тАЬI had filed the PIL with the Supreme Court on January 25 and it was admitted on February 2,тАЭ said Bagde, adding that the date of hearing is yet to be finalised by the court. Explaining the reasons behind filing the public interest litigation, he said that children from affluent families are more likely to get selected in any entrance test or recruitment process owing to their well-funded preparations rather than someone from a less-privileged background. On this basis, he has urged the apex court to stop the kin of lawmakers and grade 1 government officers from availing the perks of reservation. Citing his interactions with several politicians in Madhya Pradesh, Bagde said eligible legislators could continue to take advantage of reservation provisions in elections but their family members should be prevented from doing it in education and jobs. The law student, who says he sees a dire need of reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but doesnтАЩt have much knowledge of quota provisions in his region, even tried surrendering his caste certificate but was purportedly told by several MPs and MLAs that no such clause exists. тАЬI have in my PIL urged the SC to ensure legislation to enable those who wish to shun reservation benefits on the lines of LPG subsidy and rail travel concessions,тАЭ said Bagde. He also argued that the race to grab reservation benefits is assuming dangerous proportions, triggering social tensions and divisions. тАЬInfluential people from within the reserved categories should lead by example,тАЭ Bagde said, maintaining that this would inspire others to give up quota benefits.","IND","dalit",1,1,1,4

M K GandhiтАЩs approach to issues of caste-based exploitation and subordination has been critiqued and scrutinised by theorists and practitioners over the years. This scrutiny involves, in many instances, contrasting Gandhi and B R AmbedkarтАЩs approach to the question of Dalit emancipation. In 1996, Suhas Palshikar argued that while there are stark differences in the approach taken by Gandhi and Ambedkar, their shared goal of collective emancipation would require Gandhi to change his methodology. This is because, although Gandhi did not make caste-based inequality the centre of his struggles for emancipation, his views on the caste system reflected his тАЬultimate preparedness to abolish caste.тАЭ Anupama Rao responds to Palshikar and argues that the insight he provides into the beliefs and actions of the two thinkers reveals just how far apart their political methods and beliefs for emancipation were. A key differentiator was that AmbedkarтАЩs understanding of caste was grounded in lived experiences of violence, while GandhiтАЩs knowledge of caste was that of an abstract concept. Palshikar responds to Rao, arguing that his article attempted to build bridges between two rich discourses. Specifically, he believes that both Gandhi and Ambedkar saw Indian society as being composed of non-fragmented identities. Rao responds to Palshikar again and argues that, given the histories of domination and subordination of caste categories, they must not be depoliticised. Rather, caste divisions must be recognised and worked through, in order to achieve any form of unity.

The Forest Department claims that when a patrolling team reached a forest post at Fatehpur village near Karera, 50 km from Shivpuri, to remove an encroachment by the victim, Madan Mehtar, villagers pelted stones on them, prompting the firing of pellets. The victimтАЩs family alleges the officials fired at them during a scuffle that broke out over drawing water from a hand pump in the village. тАЬAn FIR (First Information Report) has been registered against ten identified persons and others who are unnamed,тАЭ said R.S. Chandel, Shivpuri Superintendent of Police. A case has been registered under Sections 302 [Punishment for murder], 307[Attempt to murder], 323 [Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt], 294 [Obscene acts], 147 [ Punishment for rioting.], 148 [Rioting, armed with deadly weapon], 149 [Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence commit┬нted in prosecution of common object] of the Indian Penal Code and section 3(2)(v) of the The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. No arrests have been made so far. The victimтАЩs father, Mahotam Mehtar, a permanent employee at the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri, had not received his salary for five-six months owing to absence from duty, though on medical grounds. This had led to a dispute with foresters, said Mr. Chandel. тАЬThe victim suffered more than 50 pellet wounds. A post mortem has been conducted on the body and we will get the report soon,тАЭ he said. The victimтАЩs wife Saroj Mehtar,28, gave an oral complaint to the police, based on which an FIR was registered. тАЬAround 2.30 p.m., along with mother-in-law and two daughters, she went to fetch water from the hand pump near the forest post like every day,тАЭ said the FIR. While one of the daughters washed utensils there, some water splashed on a forest Ranger nearby whoтАЩd come to fill a bottle. тАЬHe abused them and said - You lowly people, why do you come to fill water from the pump near the post?тАЭ When they protested against being abused, a female forest official allegedly slapped them. And one of the daughter called Mr. Madan and his brother Pankaj Mehtar from home, who were then hit by тАЬrifle butts and sticksтАЭ. As they attempted to run away, ""foresters fired at them from behind"", injuring them. тАЬThe brother in law got injuries on his right shoulder. Mr. Madan died on the way to the hospital.тАЭ  This is the second reported incident of pellet gun firing by the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department in eight months. In July last year, during an eviction drive in Burhanpur district, officials reportedly fired pellets at tribals, injuring four. Meanwhile, Madhav National Park Director Mohan Meena, who has initiated an inquiry, said whether the guns belonged to the department or were privately owned was being looked into. тАЬThe patrolling team comprised of rangers, SDOs (Sub Divisional Officers), and two former Army soldiers who carried rifles,тАЭ he said. Mr. Meena alleged that villagers used country pistols and pelted stones on foresters as they approached the encroachment. As for drawing water from the pump, he said, тАЬAll arrangements are made before going out on a patrol. Officials carried water with them,тАЭ he claimed. Terming the incident an тАЬencounterтАЭ, Sudhir Kode, a Dalit activist, said, тАЬOfficials took law in their own hands. They fired unprompted, that too without permission.тАЭ Stating that the incident portrayed an attempt by upper castes to deny Dalits access to resources, including water, Ravi Mahant, an activist said, тАЬThose belonging to upper castes, even in uniform, fail to shed their identity to ensure equitable distribution of resources. No matter your position in power, caste prejudice persists.тАЭ Threatening to stage a dharna outside the Madhya Pradesh Chief MinisterтАЩs residence in Bhopal, Former Bhim Army State in-charge Sunil Astay wrote on Twitter, тАЬCanтАЩt Dalits even touch a hand pump now? The mountain of atrocities has broken loose on Dalits in Madhya PradeshтАж. A brother of the Valmiki caste was shot dead for filling water from the pump.тАЭ Last September at Bhavkhedi village in the district, two upper caste men allegedly thrashed to death two Dalit children, who did not have toilets at home, for defecating in the open.

Further, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust will have one member from the Dalit community. The member is Kameshwar Chaupal, the ""first kar sevak."" Chaupal told BBC Hindi that he only learned of his inclusion in the trust upon Wednesday's announcement. Speaking on his appointment, Chaupal said, ""I think the Modi government has only included those who are deeply devoted to Hinduism, Hindutva and saint traditions."" He said he wasn't appointed solely because he is a Dalit, but because of his advocacy for the temple from the get-go. Born on April 24, 1956, Chaupal hails from Bihar's Mithila region. In Hinduism, it is believed that the region was home to Goddess Sita, before she married the Hindu God Rama and moved to Ayodhya. Chaupal said that although Rama may be a God to the rest of the world, in Mithila, he is treated as a son-in-law, BBC reported. While pursuing a Master's degree from the Mithila University in Darbhanga, Chaupal joined the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) in 1984. The same year, the VHP organized a Hindu Sammelan at Delhi's Vigyan Bhavan. Chaupal participated in the conference. He said it was at the Hindu Sammelan that a nationwide public awareness campaign for the construction of a Ram temple was announced. Chaupal said that before the foundation stone for the Ram temple was laid in 1989, saints and religious leaders at a Kumbh Mela had decided that a Dalit would do the honor. VHP and RSS leaders settled on November 9, 1989, as the 'auspicious' date for shilanyas (laying of foundation stone). Chaupal was then the VHP joint general secretary in-charge of Bihar's tribal-dominated districts. ""Coincidentally, religious leaders invited me to lay the temple's first brick,"" Chaupal told BBC. Speaking to News 18 in 2017 on the events of November 9, 1989, Chaupal recalled that he was not informed that he had been chosen to lay the temple's foundation until the last minute. Then-VHP leader Ashok Singhal's close aide Rameshwar reportedly informed Chaupal of his duties that very morning. Then aged 34, Chaupal laid the temple's first brick at the shilanyas site, close to where the Babri Mosque once stood. He was also sat beside Singhal at the ceremony. Chaupal told News 18, ""I could hardly comprehend what was happening. I was an ordinary worker, sitting with who's who of the Hindu religious leadership."" In 1992, the mosque was demolished by kar sevaks. As he rose to prominence, Chaupal tried his hand at politics, contesting the 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on a BJP ticket. However, he lost. He then unsuccessfully contested the 1995 Bihar Assembly polls from Begusarai. In 2002, he was elected to the Bihar Legislative Council and served two terms. He also contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Supaul, but lost.  Want to share it with your friends too? Love India news? Subscribe to stay updated.","IND","dalit",0,0,0,0

The Supreme Court has held that states are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions. In a statement, the CPI said Article 16 of the constitution upholds the responsibility of state to provide equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. ""Nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the services under state. ""The RSS may be pleased with the recent ruling of Supreme Court. But the Dalits, Tribals and Backward Classes are disappointed and agitated,"" it said. The top court gave the ruling while dealing with pleas regarding Uttarakhand government's September 5, 2012 decision to fill up all posts in public services in the state without providing reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  The government's decision was challenged in the Uttarakhand High Court, which struck it down. ""The CPI expresses its disagreement and opposition to the Supreme Court's latest ruling on reservation in government jobs and promotions. Article 16 of our Constitution upholds the responsibility of state to provide equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. The CPI urges upon the government to take necessary legislative measures to protect the policy of reservation,"" it said.

The Rajput men threatened me with dire consequences if I told anyone,тАЭ the man said about the incident Seven people -- the manager and six employees of a motorcycle service centre -- have been arrested in connection with the incident that took place on February 16, three days before the videos surfaced on social media. In the videos, two Dalits are seen being beaten with fan belts and one of them, the 23-year-old, is stripped and violated with a screwdriver. One of the accused filmed the torture on his mobile phone. The Nagaur incident has once again exposed the ugly reality of the deep caste divide that exists in Rajasthan and the fear of the upper castes that the Dalits live in despite promises by successive governments to protect them from oppression and ensure their emancipation. Rajasthan Police crime branch data show that incidents of violence against the Dalits increased 47.47% from 2018 to 2019. Kavita Srivastav, general secretary of the Rajasthan chapter of the PeopleтАЩs Union for Civil Liberties, says the Dalits continue to face caste violence and live in fear of the police. Another case in point is the April 2019 gang rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in front of her husband by five men who filmed the crime in RajasthanтАЩs Alwar and put it on social media. The rapists had waylaid the couple and beaten up the husband before taking turns to rape the woman. The victimтАЩs family said the local police did not register a case although a complaint was lodged on April 29. A case was finally registered on May 2 under the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after the video had gone viral and chief minister Ashok Gehlot issued an order that the first information report be registered in the offices of the superintendent of police. Nagaur district has the fifth highest number of cases of cruelty against Dalits in Rajasthan. According to police data, in 2019, Ganganagar and Bharatpur had the highest number of cases (408 each) followed by Hanumangarh with 311, Bikaner with 292, closely followed by Nagaur with 281. Additional director general of police (crime) BL Soni said the increase in the number of incidents of violence against Dalits in Rajasthan was a reflection of a liberal FIR registration policy adopted by the police. Former Rajasthan director general of police and current Congress MLA Harish Chandra Meena questioned this claim. He said he had to sit on a sit-in protest in Tonk district to get an FIR registered in the suspicious death of a lorry driver last year. Even in the Alwar gang rape case, no FIR was registered until the video of the incident had gone viral, he pointed out.. In the Nagaur incident, Satish Kumar of the Centre for Dalit Rights noted, the victimsтАЩ family said news of the incident had spread locally. тАЬIf people locally knew about the incident, was the police sleeping for three days,тАЭ he asked. The 23-year-old man who was beaten up and violated in the incident sat huddled in a two-room tenement on a sprawling 14-acre farm where the jeera crop was ready to harvest. His village, Sohan Nagar, is set in the sandy flatlands of Nagaurt, 350 km from the Rajasthan capital Jaipur. The victim and his cousin were assaulted in Karnu village where they had gone to get their bike serviced at the garage owned by a Rajput, Hanuman Singh, who is now in police custody. According to the accused, the cousins stole some money from the cash counter -- the reason why they were tortured . When the video went viral on February 19, the police had no option but to act. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose party governs Rajasthan, tweeted that the government should take prompt action. The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party dispatched delegations to the village to probe the incident. Rashtriya Loktantrik Party leader Hanuman Beniwal and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati attacked the Congress government. Politicians, Dalit rights activists, members of civil society organisations, media and the police all made a beeline to the remote village. The same day, the victims went to the Panchodi police station to file an FIR, and the police arrested the seven suspects within hours. Investigating officer Mukul Sharma said there had been no negligence by the police.On the video, he said: тАЬIt was the social media cell of the Nagaur police that intercepted the video on February 18 and informed us and we acted.тАЭ On the allegation that the torture victims had stolen money, Sharma said an FIR of theft had been filed against the cousins and the complaint was being investigated. He said the police had written to Facebook and other social media sites to remove the video from their platforms. Gautam Nayak, a lawyer, is blunt. тАЬThe SHO (station house officer) Rajpal Singh is a Rajput and the accused are Rajputs. He tried to shield them. We are demanding that he be suspended.тАЭ Satish Kumar of the Centre for Dalit Rights said the police had invoked mild provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the he Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, such as wrongful restraint, voluntarily causing hurt and unlawful assembly against the suspects. тАЬThey should have also put sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 120 (B) (punishment for criminal conspiracy), 326 (a) (punishment for acid attacks) of the IPC. Sections 3 (2) (giving false evidence) and section 3 (2) (iii) (committing mischief by fire or any explosive substance) of the SC/ST Act and sections 66 and 67 of the IT Act,тАЭ he said. PL Mimroth, founder of the Centre for Dalit Rights, said the law alone cannot do enough to prevent the recurrence of such violations. тАЬThe hold of the caste divide is perhaps a pointer to the fact that law alone cannot vanquish such social evils,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhy do certain castes feel emboldened to act in reprehensible ways,тАЭ he asked. тАЬThere is a need to change the mindset and sensitise the people.тАЭ Get our daily newsletter Get free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

The gruesome act, however, forced police to rush and file a case but only after a video made by the assaulters went viral on Wednesday. Seven people have been arrested in the case on the complaint of the Dalit youth in the presence of Deputy Superintendent of Police of Nagaur. Police identified the young victim as a resident of Karanu village under Panchauri police station area in the district. Those booked in the case are Bhim Singh, Aidan Singh, Asu Singh, Sawai Singh, Laxman Singh, Hanuman Singh and Ganpatram. As per the complaint, the accused thrashed the youth and pushed a cloth soaked in petrol into his rectum with the help of a screwdriver, severely injuring him. The victimтАЩs cousin, who was with him, was also beaten up. When the victimтАЩs condition deteriorated, neighbours intervened and rushed him to a nearby hospital. The victim said in the complaint that on February 16, he went to Karanu village to get his bike serviced along with his cousin where the accused charged him with stealing at the counter. When he denied it, they started assaulting him. Nagaur Superintendent of Police Vikas Pathak said he immediately formed several police teams to identify the assaulters through the video and they were arrested. The incident, however, has blown into a political storm, with three MLAs of RLP boycotting Chief Minister Ashok GehlotтАЩs Budget Speech in the Rajasthan Assembly on Wednesday even as the BJP joined the protest.

Led by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) functionary in Gaya region, the group had camped about a mile off the disputed site. Oram since his arrival had shown signs of unrest. He had vowed to lay the foundation stone for a grand Ram temple at the site where Babri Masjid stood. Else, he would not return to his village. To avoid any untoward incident, Kameshwar Chaupal, the VHP joint general secretary in-charge of tribal-dominated districts in Bihar, was asked to keep a close watch on Oram. November 9, 1989 was the тАШauspiciousтАЩ day chosen by top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and VHP leaders to performs shilanyas and lay the foundation for the тАШproposed grand templeтАЩ at Ayodhya. It was to be the culmination of decade-long campaign led by the VHP and nurtured by the RSS. Early that Wednesday morning, VHP leader Ashok SinghalтАЩs close aide Rameshwar came looking for Chaupal. At the shilanyas site, very close to the disputed structure, Chaupal was accorded the coveted seat beside Singhal. Swami Chinmayananda, who would go on to become a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, was the master of the ceremony. With Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, seers and saints in attendance, the puja began. In a powerful political statement, from a bevy of gurus lined up for the event, the VHP had chosen a Dalit boy from Saharasa in Bihar to lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and of the BJP in national politics. Once Shilanyas was done, Kameshswar Chaupal left Ayodhya for his village in Bihar. On his arrival, Chaupal was told Baldev Jha, head of a prosperous Brahmin family had sent a message and wished to see him. тАЬWe had lived under centuries of subjugation, and I was reluctant. But my father coaxed me to go and meet Baldev Babu,тАЭ Chaupal recalled speaking to News18 in December, 2017. For a person who had never entered an Upper Caste household in his village, Chaupal was unsure of the reception he would receive. тАЬTo my shock, Baldev Babu held my hand, made me sit beside him and asked everyone in the family, young and old, to touch my feet. They had read about me in the newspapers,тАЭ he recalled. Chaupal later contested 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on BJP ticket, but lost. Chaupal tried his luck for the second time in 1995 Assembly polls. Five years later, he was nominated to the Bihar Legislative Council, where he served for two terms. Ahead of the 2014 general elections, JD(U) had broken its poll pact with the BJP. It asked him to contest from a general seat. Chaupal lost to Pappu YadavтАЩs wife and Congress candidate Ranjeet Ranjan. тАЛ","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

The Tamil Nadu state government has been directed to pay a compensation of Rs 25,00,000 to the family of a Dalit man who was hacked to death by a gang in Thoothukudi district in 2015. Noting that the state had been willfully negligent, Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court also slammed the government and the police for inaction. Arumugaraja, a 45-year-old Dalit farmer from Srivaikuntam, had repeatedly complained about threats to his life from some dominant caste members of his village. However, despite an incident of Arumugaraja├в┬А┬Щs crops being set on fire, the police had not arrested the main accused. Justice SS Sundar observed that despite claims to the contrary, the state government and police department ├в┬А┬Ьhave not explained to the acceptance of this Court that they have strictly followed the procedure prescribed in law to its logical end to bring the peace and normalcy in the locality.├в┬А┬Э ├в┬А┬ЬHence, the murder was on account of recalcitrant attitude and the improper way of handling a serious complaint without considering the tension prevailed in the area by the police officials. The peace committee meeting was again an eye wash as it is stated by the petitioner.├в┬А┬Э said the court. It added, ├в┬А┬ЬA widow has lost her son, when she was 43 years and when she was in need of him for her protection and solace after the death of her husband. She had lost her hope in the State, who failed to give protection and she has to remain with a fear, which is painful.├в┬А┬Э The court also found that Arumugaraja was targeted not due to personal reasons but communal ones, for the dominant caste group to 'send a message.' Even as no protection was provided to Arumugaraja despite multiple requests, he was hacked to death in close proximity to the Srivaikuntam police station. Arumugaraja├в┬А┬Щs murder had caused tensions in the Navaladiar village at the time between the Dalits and the Maravar community. As far back as 2013, K Rukmani, Arumugaraja's mother, had alleged that the persons, who were posing a potential threat to her and her son, were neither summoned nor directed to appear before a court-ordered peace meeting. Moreover, the meeting itself was only an eyewash not to take action against the accused, the mother stated. Rukmini stated before the court that ├в┬А┬Ьdue to the wilful inaction on the part of the Government, particularly, the District Administration and the Superintendent of Police, Tuticorin emboldened the criminal elements to carry out their objectives.├в┬А┬Э Upholding this, the court said, ├в┬А┬ЬMishandling of the criminal complaint in 2013 has also paved way for the accused repeatedly threatening the life of [Rukmini] and her second son.

The incident took place on Wednesday and hundreds of tehsil office employees staged a demonstration at the police station demanding Hazari Singh's arrest. According to reports, Hazari Singh beat up the employee, Radhey Shyam, following a dispute over the choice of a particular booth level officer in Jamdharwa village. As the argument turned aggressive, Hazari Singh beat the employee. ""I tried to explain to him that the matter would be resolved in due course, but he and his half a dozen men beat me up. They slapped and kicked me when I fell down on the ground,"" Radhey Shyam said. Hazari Singh, however, completely denied the incident and said that the concerned employee had misbehaved with them and had pushed one of his supporters. ""I simply intervened and then returned with my supporters while the employee went his way,"" he said. BJP MLA Surendra Singh is known for his controversial statements in which he has used derogatory words against political leaders like BSP chief Mayawati and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

Jaisalmer: Three Dalit youths were assaulted after being accused of stealing donkeys in Jaisalmer district, the third such incident to come to light in Rajsthan in recent days. Five persons have been arrested and three detained after a video of the incident surfaced, police said on Sunday. The incident occurred on February 15 in Rama village of Fatehgarh tehsil of the district. The youths were thrashed with sticks and kicked by nearly a dozen people for stealing donkeys. They were later handed over to Sangarh police. ""Five persons have been arrested and three minors have been detained so far. A case has been registered in the matter under sections of SC/ST Act and further investigation in the matter is on,"" Station House Officer (SHO) of Sangarh police station Ugam Raj Soni said. Similar incidents had come to light in Nagaur and Barmer. A chilling video of a man being beaten up brutally in Barmer allegedly for committed a theft had gone viral here, prompting the police to arrest a man and detain another on Friday for their alleged roles in the crime. The video surfaced on Thursday close on the heels of brutal assault on two Dalit youths on similar allegation of theft in Nagaur. The Barmer incident occurred on January 29. Police have arrested at least seven persons in connection with the Nagaur case which occurred on February 16. The Dalit men were beaten up, stripped and tortured by staffers of a motorcycle service agency in Karanu village after accusing them of committing theft. In the video, a group of men is seen thrashing two persons with rubber belts. They later dipped a piece of cloth wrapped on a screwdriver in petrol and inserted it in the private parts of one of the victims. The incidents have triggered a political storm in Rajasthan with the BJP attacking the ruling Congress. Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has alleged that the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government is unable to rein in crime in Rajasthan. Meghwal, who is an MP from Bikaner, had accused the police of manipulating the Nagaur case.","IND","dalit",0,0,1,4

Today, there are three broad, influential tre┬нnds in Dalit politics: First, there are fewer opportunities for Dalit political parties today because of the BJPтАЩs resurgence. In the 1990s, when Dalit parties came up, the Congress was declining and lots of small parties competed with each other; no one dominated. It is much easier for a small party to win a seat when voters spread their votes across five or six parties than just two or three. The 1990s were also the days of coalition governments.

Following the public outrage over the incident and the pressure to act against culprits, an FIR into the incident was lodged at the Cantonment police station late on Friday night. Leaders of political parties including CongressтАЩs district president Nirmala Paswan, BSP workers led by district president Ghanshyam Rahi and BJP MLC Devendra Pratap Singh met the victim at the district hospital, where she was admitted after the incident. SSP Sunil Gupta said, тАЬYesterday, on February 14, a woman came to the district hospital and alleged that two policemen took her away on a bike and raped her in a hotel. The police acted swiftly on the complaint after which name of a hotel surfaced. During detailed investigation, the charges were found to be untrue. It came to the fore, on the basis of CCTV footage and the statement of hotelтАЩs guard that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own. So, prima facie, the matter seems to be suspicious. However an FIR has been lodged for further action.тАЭ According to reports, the incident occurred on Thursday night when the woman was returning home with her mother and elder sister on Thursday night at around 9pm on foot. According to the woman, as she walked ahead of her mother, two bike-borne policemen came and forced her to sit on their bike. When she resisted they threatened to frame her in a sex racket and assured that they will let her go after questioning at the police station. Instead of the police station, the duo took her to a hotel room, forced her to consume alcohol and then raped her taking turns. They also beat her up and gave her Rs 600 while threatening her not to open her mouth. On returning home late at night, she narrated her ordeal to her mother.

The woman, who suffered about 95 per cent burns in the incident that took place in Andhari village of Sillod tehsil on Sunday midnight, was undergoing treatment at a government medical college and hospital in Aurangabad city. ""She died around 10 pm on Wednesday,"" the hospital's medical superintendent Suresh Harbade told news agency PTI. The accused, Santosh Mohite (50), who knew the woman as he stayed in her neighbourhood in Andhari village, was arrested on Tuesday, a police official said. As per the woman's statement given to police before death, she tried to push Mohite out of her house, but in vain. This led to a quarrel between them following which Mohite set her ablaze, Sillod (rural) police station's inspector Kiran Bidve said. ""The victim and the accused knew each other and he used to come to her house. But, on Sunday when he came around midnight, the woman opposed it saying their meeting at that hour would defame her,"" he said. However, despite her opposition, Mohite entered her house and they had a fight, he said. ""During the quarrel, Mohite poured kerosene kept nearby on the woman and set her afire,"" he added. The accused later locked the door from outside and ran away, the police said. On hearing the woman's screams, some of her relatives staying in the vicinity rushed to the place and took her to a local hospital, from where she was referred to the government hospital in Aurangabad city. The accused was earlier booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code or IPC for an attempt to murder, voluntarily causing hurt, house-trespass with preparation for causing hurt to any person intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, Mr Bidve said. He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the official said. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jaleel demanded that the case be tried in a fast-track court for ensuring justice to the victim and her family.  The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader said he has demanded in Parliament that hearing be conducted in fast-track court in this case and that of a woman set on fire in Wardha district. A 25-year-old lecturer was set ablaze by a stalker in Wardha on Monday, leaving her critically injured. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world.

""There will be 15 trustees in Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from Dalit society,"" tweeted Union Home Minister Amit Shah as he thanked PM Narendra Modi for the decision. The trust will also be an independent body, capable of taking all decisions regarding the construction of the temple, said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. ""Thank you to Modiji for setting up an autonomous trust to build a grand temple at the birthplace of Lord Shri Ram.The 'Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra' trust will be completely independent and capable of taking all decisions related to temple construction. Jai Shree Ram!"" Adityanath tweeted thanking the Narendra Modi government for taking a step closer to building the temple. The Centre's decision regarding Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra trust was announced by PM Modi in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. Announcing the trust, PM Modi said the trust will take over the disputed 67.703 acres of land and has an inside and outside courtyard. He also informed the Uttar Pradesh government has given its approval for 5 acres to be alloted to Sunni Waqf Board, as ordered by the Supreme Court. Ending a more than two decade-long land dispute in Ayodhya's Ram Janmanbhoomi, the apex court had on November 9 last year ordered that the disputed land at Ayodhya must be given to a trust for construction of a Ram temple and ordered the Central government to formulate a scheme within three months. The three-month deadline was nearing its deadline on February 9. However, the Congress has questioned the timing of the announcement, linking it to the forthcoming Delhi assembly elections. Interestingly, the Shiv Sena, BJP former ally in Maharashtra, was one of the first parties to respond to the setting up of the trust. It welcomed the Modi government's decision. The Shiv Sena is currently a Congress-NCP ally in Maharashtra where it is running a government with Udhhav Thackeray as the chief minister.

""Kotdia had come to his native village for marriage a a few days back. When we tried to ignore the objections raised by upper caste members of the village, they pelted stones. A 60-year-old man and some women playing garba were injured, and a DJ sound system was damaged,"" he said. Ironically, the horse itself belonged to a man from the upper caste Thakor community, he said. ""We approached the police which gave us protection,"" he said.

Next year, he will try his luck once again. It is not because he was not prepared for the papers. A student of Tribhuvan Secondary School of Khalanga, he actually couldn't make it to the 10th grade even after getting through the 9th grade as he could not pay the admission fees of Rs 930 on time. ""I did not have that much money in hand so I could not get admitted to the 10th grade, and then I stopped going to the school. Now when others are going to sit for SEE, I am feeling bad,"" he said. ""I will try next year,"" he added. His younger sister Anita also dropped out of school last year. She passed the 5th grade from Narajyoti Primary School and she also needed to pay Rs 930 to get into the next class. This was not paid and she stopped going to school. Instead, she is seen busy grinding stones with her mother near a riverbank. She also goes out to graze cows. ""I did not have money for the admission fees. Mother could not manage it either, so I stayed at home,"" she said. ""May be next year, it will get a little comfortable, even I am working and earning,"" she added. It is not just Suraj and Anita, their younger sister Gita has been deprived of education too. After failing to pay the admission fees and manage other expenses, Gita also stopped going to school from last year. ""I love to go to school, but I am not going there these days. I go with my mother and work,"" she said. She was also a 6th grader, studying with her sister. The children's father Bir Bahadur Nepali died four years ago in Ramgadh in India in a fire accident. A local of Gangatiya village of Bheri Municipality тАУ 6, he had left for India after settling family in the district headquarters for the children's education. But after his demise, things turned worse for his wife and children. The couple has six children. None of them go to school currently. According to Nirmala, the children's mother, the living expense in the headquarters is too high and the family faces the question of survival. In such a situation, educating children is challenging. ""It is not just about the admission fees. Uniform, books, stationery and other expenses - I don't have money to afford all that,"" she said. ""I work the whole day and the pay is not enough even to feed my kids properly,"" she lamented. The family has a small cottage to live in, a small plot of land in the backyard and a pair of old cows. According to Nirmala, her children can go to school only if somebody extends support. Vice principal of Tribhuvan Secondary School of Khalanga, Haribahadur Basnet stated that Dalit students could be considered for lesser amount of admission fees. But the family has not notified it to the school, he said. ""For the extremely poor, the school can make some considerations. But they have to fill the form accordingly. We have not been formally informed of this,"" he claimed. Meanwhile, Dal Bahadur Gharti, administrative officer at Bheri Municipality, expressed concern over the fee provisions. Schools cannot compel the students to pay fees up to the secondary level, he said. ""Moreover, they are Dalits. In case of Dalits, schools should be even more sensitive,"" he said, adding that the school administrations would be quizzed about it. The constitution guarantees right to education for every child in the country. For Dalit and needy kids, the government is supposed to offer residential facilities for his or her smooth schooling. However, many children in the country hit by extreme poverty continue to drop out before completing their secondary level education.

Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, while referring to the inclusion of Kameshwar Chaupal, a Scheduled Caste member from Patna in the trust, said on Friday: тАЬNot just Dalits but backwards too should get representation in the Ram Mandir Trust as they are as staunch a Ram Bhakt as the former.тАЭ The BJP leader said: тАЬI want to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for the commendable work.

Meanwhile, another BJP leader Uma Bharti, also former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, told a news channel in Bhopal that she backed Kalyan SinghтАЩs demand. тАЬI am with Kalyan Singh on this because many OBCs, including me, were at the forefront of the Ayodhya Ram Temple movement.

The Congress, which is running at a slow pace in the campaigning for the Delhi Assembly polls, has planned meetings of its top leadership as part of a strategy to give an edge to the campaign in the last phase and bring back its old vote bank. Five rallies of the Gandhi family will be held in Delhi in two days. The party's interim president Sonia Gandhi will address a rally in East Delhi. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are expected to address four rallies jointly. On February 5, Sonia Gandhi's rally will be held at Shastri Park in East Delhi, in which the Muslim vote will be in a decisive position. Seelampur and Gandhinagar Assembly constituencies are directly connected with Shastri Park, while adjoining seats like Babarpur, Mustafabad, Karaval Nagar are crucial in terms of Muslim votes. On February 5, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will address a rally at the Muslim-dominated Old Delhi's Haus Qazi area, around which there are seats like Matia Mahal, Ballimaran, Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar where Muslim voters are more than 20 per cent. The politics in these Muslim dominated areas are mainly on issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Congress has put its stand against the CAA and NRC very strongly in their manifesto too. The party hopes that it will get the sympathy of Muslim voters in the Delhi elections. Both the leaders will also hold a meeting in the Kondli area of East Delhi to reach out to the Dalit vote bank. While Kondli is a Scheduled Caste (SC) reserved constituency, the Trilokpuri and Seemapuri seats adjacent to it are also reserved for the SC. Their meeting in Kondli will be on February 5. On February 4, Rahul and Priyanka will address a meeting at Sangam Vihar in South Delhi, which is a Purvanchali-dominated seat. From this seat, Poonam Jha Azad, wife of Kirti Jha Azad, the head of the campaign committee of Delhi Congress, is contesting. Kirti Azad has been Projected as Purvanchali face in Delhi by the Congress. Apparently, campaigning for his wife can be seen as an attempt to give a message to the Purvanchali voters across Delhi. It is also important here that along with Sangam Vihar, seats like Deoli and Ambedkar Nagar are adjacent, which are in the reserved category. Apart from this, on February 4, the two leaders will seek votes for the Congress' prominent Sikh leader Tarvinder Marwah from Jangpura seat. Campaigning in Delhi will end on February 6 and voting will be done on February 8. (ANI) (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Swaroopanand Saraswati's disciple Avimukteshwaranand on Friday also threatened to move the court if the government doesn't make any amendments.  Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati of Sharda Peeth and Jyotishpeeth here has objected to inclusion of Vasudevanand Saraswati who has been named as the Shankaracharya of Jyotish peeth, while the Supreme Court has earlier recognised Swaroopanand as the Shankaracharya of the Jyotish peeth.  In a statement, Swaroopanand Saraswati said: ""I am the Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth. The Prime Minister by nominating another person as Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth has disobeyed the Supreme Court which even refused to consider Vasudevanand a sanyasi.  The seer who is based in this Madhya Pradesh town said that the Supreme Court has in four rulings refused to acknowledge Vasudevanand as Shankaracharya.  ""If Shankaracharya was really to be associated with the trust he should have been named to preside over the trust instead of Parasaran, the advocate for Ramjanmabhoomi land case.  He has been made the office of the chairman of the trust and his residence. Parasaran is a senior advocate of the country and a Jusrist of repute... The government seems to be keen to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya as per the secular constitution and not according to Vedic provisions,"" he said in a statement.  Shankaracharya said a Ramalaya Trust was formed in the 1990s for the construction of Ram temple in the conference of the four Shankaracharyas, which included other representatives including Shankaracharyas, Vaishnavacharyas, representatives of the Akharas.  This trust was built for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya but the Central government has ignored a working trust while setting up a new trust, he said.  Swami Swaroopanand said a Scheduled Caste person included in the trust belongs to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Besides, some officials have been appointed by the government, in gross violation of the Constitution. Any trust that includes a government functionary who cannot be responsible for the construction of a shrine, he contended.  Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharati, who belongs to the Lodhi caste wants an OBC member in the trust. Former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Kalyan Singh, is also a contender as an OBC. He was the Chief Minister when Babri Mosque was pulled down ┬й 2021 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

The incident took place in the Dokati village on Saturday night where a 'bhandara' (community feast) was being held and the entire village was invited to the function. Upendra Ram, 30, who works in a coal shop, came to the function straight from the shop, and had coal stains on his hands. As soon as he picked up the food for himself, the four youths objected to his picking up the food without washing his hands. A verbal spat soon turned ugly and the youth attacked him with hot tongs.  As Ram fell to the ground, one of the youths picked up a trident and attacked him with it. Ram has been admitted to a hospital in a critical condition. The police are yet to register a case and arrest the accused. A police official said that no complaint had been filed in the matter. CM Aditya Bisht is relaxing after Delhi election campaign. After that, he has to prepare for high power Bihar election! CM Yogi's model of cleanliness and administration... India has to go a long way to abolish untouchability like rampant evil practices. Attacking dalit or anyone for no fault is grave crime!Evil practices such as racial abuses are prevalent in developed countries as well but to a far lesser level.It's moral duty of all of us, our society, political parties and Govt to continuously educate the masses against such practices and take stringent deterrent actions on the perpetrators to prevent occurrence of such evil practices. Frustrated by vedic culture the Dravidian Bassvsnna stood against social practices before 900 years back And at present Dravidian are attacked frequently. Periyar also social reform er from Dravidian and both are from Karnataka While Corona virus has become an international threat, washing your hands is important! I sometimes wonder, with so many centuries of boasting of Sanatana Dharma, why no one has tried to eradicate this untouchability.Whenever Hindu Jagarana Vedike holds Hindu Sammelana, they say 'Navella Hindu, Navella Ondu' but in reality the lower castes in Hindus know that they will never be one.

The youngster left the spot, but returned to the colony with his friends on five bikes. An argument ensued between them and in a fit of anger one of the youngsters stabbed Kalaiarasan from the colony and the gang fled the spot leaving behind their bikes. Other villagers rushed Kalaiarasan to the Tiruvannamalai Government Medical College Hospital. However, he died on the way to the hospital. Angered over the incident, youngsters from the Dalit colony set fire to the five bikes left behind by the attackers.

Krishna Gate, as the entrance that serves as a conduit between IIT-M and Velachery is called, was closed by the IIT-M administration on December 25 2019. In a subsequent email, IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthy claimed the gate was shut due to a тАЬheightened security threatтАЭ from тАЬundesirable elementsтАЭ who hangout near the gate, and to prevent the sale of тАЬbanned substancesтАЭ and тАЬassault on womenтАЭ students. The residents of Velachery, many of whom are Adi Dravidar Dalits, see the closure of the gate as the betrayal of a 60-year-old agreement between IIT-M and their ancestors whose lands were acquired for the instituteтАЩs campus, and a clear instance of caste-based discrimination. Protests against the closure of the gate have acquired such momentum that the matter was recently raised on the floor of Tamil NaduтАЩs Legislative Assembly. Residents say the Adi Dravidar community lost at least 76 acres of land in the deal that was struck after deliberations between the sarpanchs of Velachery, Taramani, and Kanagam on the one hand, and K Kamaraj, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. A Lakshmanaswamy, the first chairman of the IIT board of governors, and Dr. B Sengupto the first director of IIT-Madras. In return for their lands, residents were promised access to the campus through Krishna gate, employment on campus and the right to worship at their temple, Peeliamman Kovil which also fell on IIT lands after the acquisition. Over the next decades, children born in the area were also promised preferential enrollment in schools located inside the campus, residents said, adding that close to 500 students from the locality now study at the Vanavani and Kendriya Vidyalaya schools on campus. The sudden and arbitrary closure of the gate has broken this decades-long pact, prompting the question of how institutions like the IITs see their place in Indian society: As open campuses fostering a culture of engagement; or as elite, isolated enclaves where nerdy students prep feverishly for high-paying corporate jobs, while justifying their publicly subsidised education under the guise of nation-building. тАЬWho are they to stop us?тАЭ asked Manimaran, a resident of Velachary at a public meeting held on January 19 under a tamarind tree close to the now-shuttered Krishna Gate. тАЬUnder this tamarind tree generations of our people have been gathering to settle issues of the community,тАЭ Manimaran continued. тАЬThis land belongs to us and we gave them some of it for development. We will reclaim the gate and our right to enter IIT no matter what.тАЭ Residents said the administration only seems to have perceived a threat to student safety from Krishna Gate тАФ which opens out into a predominantly Dalit settlement. Taramani Gate, which opens out into a Brahmin and Other Backward Classes neighbourhood, had been kept open. тАЬScheduled Caste people live in this area. By issuing the explanation about тАЬundesirable elementsтАЭ, the IIT director has wounded us. This is an insult,тАЭ said K. Rajendran, a retired IIT-Madras employee who got a job because his mother gave up her land for the institute. Assistant Commissioner of Police PK Ravi confirmed that the police had recently arrested a few men selling marijuana near Krishna gate, but added the problem wasnтАЩt restricted to a particular community or neighbourhood. тАЬWe had arrested some anti-social elements who were peddling banned substances near the Krishna gate six months ago,тАЭ Ravi said. тАЬThe problem persists even near Taramani gate of the instituteтАЭ. Thol Thirumavalavan, the Member of Parliament for Chidambaram constituency too had made his concerns explicit in a letter to the IIT administration. тАЬWhile all gates including those designated for other communities are open and accessible, the IIT management has shut the gate for Adi Dravidar people with the ill intention of untouchability,тАЭ Thirumavalavan said. тАЬThis act has not only destroyed the livelihood of AD people but it is also unlawful caste discriminationтАЭ. V. Prabhu was six years old when his familyтАЩs lands were acquired by IIT-Madras in 1959. тАЬWe used to live where the womenтАЩs hostels now stand,тАЭ said Prabhu, who is now 60. The family had 11 cows and used to supply milk to nearby households, and also ran a cycle stand with 21 bicycles that they rented out to residents. When their land was acquired, Prabhu said, the family faced hard times. Initially, there was little demand for milk as the land had been cleared, and only a few IIT officers, staff and students were on campus; the cycle business shut down as well. The family eagerly awaited the promised jobs on campus. But few, if any promises of jobs, employment and development were coded into the land acquisition contracts signed with the villagers in 1959. The only land acquisition document that villagers could share with HuffPost India, lists 27 names of owners most of whom had sold the land where their тАЬhutsтАЭ once stood. They were paid government land rates ranging between Rs. 6 to Rs. 65. The document signed on 2 December 1964 by a Revenue Division Officer, also notes that the government had paid a total of Rs. 672.50 to 27 families at the time. In 1972, Prabhu was offered a temporary job in the electricity and maintenance wing but he soon quit because the pay was too low. тАЬI took up business and started earning better,тАЭ he said. His children, now in their 20s, had studied in IIT-MтАЩs Vanavani school in their teens by availing the preferential admission process which has since been phased out. As PrabhuтАЩs business picked up, he moved out of Velachery. So why was he still part of the Krishna gate protests? тАЬWhen my father was alive, he used to go for walks into the IIT campus. He used to fight security personnel if they stopped him because he was convinced that he still had claim over the land which the government took,тАЭ Prabhu said. тАЬOur sweat and blood is part of this land. The closure has hurt the pride of all our people.тАЭ In this context, the closure of the Krishna gate appears to have triggered deep social memories of exclusion. Since the gate was shut in December 2019, the only way to reach Velachary from campus is via a 3 km detour. As a consequence, several small shops and businesses set up to cater to IITтАЩs student population have suffered: Photocopy centres, eateries, bike repair shops and even the local housing market. S. Kumareshan, a mechanic, said he has been out of work for three weeks. тАЬThe owner of the bike repair shop is thinking of taking his business elsewhere if the gate remains shut,тАЭ Kumareshan said. Students who have rented apartments in the vicinity too may move out soon, landowners said, expressing fear over a drop in rent rates and real estate prices. Retired IIT employees who have been using banking and medical services on campus are hit by the gate closure because they are now forced to travel much further to avail the facilities, residents said. тАЬI am a heart patient,тАЭ said Rajendran, the former IIT employee. тАЬIf I suffer cardiac arrest or any other ailment I will now be forced to go to a private hospital located about six kilometres away instead of availing the pensionerтАЩs medical health benefits at the IIT hospitalтАЭ. тАЬтАЬIITs were conceived with a vision to mould engineers and researchers who could contribute to the process of nation building... The move to isolate us from the population outside is in direct conflict with this goalтАЭ.тАЭ Women students for Krishna gate The decision to close Krishna gate, IITтАЩs administration has claimed, was partly out of concerns for the safety of women students. Yet the instituteтАЩs women students appear unconvinced. 1,500 students тАФ many of them women тАФ have submitted a petition to the IIT administration demanding that the gate be reopened. тАЬThe director is misleading the public,тАЭ said K. Fabitha, a research associate at IIT-Madras who has participated in the protests. тАЬI have been using the gate to go back home late at night. I have never come across the presence of any unsafe elements there.тАЭ While the IIT administration had claimed that a woman student was assaulted near Krishna gate, Fabitha said the assault had actually occurred elsewhere. The Krishna gate, she said, served as a vital conduit between the institute and the Velachery neighbourhood. тАЬThere is an emotional connection with the people and the place near Krishna gate,тАЭ Fabitha said. тАЬThey have always been a good memory attached to life in the institute. We could never differentiate between тАШusтАЩ and тАШthemтАЩтАЭ. тАЬIITs were conceived with a vision to mould engineers and researchers who could contribute to the process of nation-building,тАЭ said a member of ChintaBAR, an independent student body in IIT Madras, seeking anonymity as they feared they might be targeted by the administration. тАЬThe move to isolate us from the population outside is in direct conflict with this goalтАЭ.

Theivanai, said that her brother was тАЬattacked only because he was a DalitтАЭ. R. Sakthivel tied up by the mob. Photo: Video screengrab New Delhi: A 24-year-old Dalit man was beaten to death in Tamil Nadu after he was found squatting on the roadside to relieve himself. Police have arrested seven people, four men and three women, on Friday after videos of the torture of the youth, R. Sakthivel, surfaced on social media. The incident had taken place on Wednesday. SakthivelтАЩs elder sister, R. Theivanai, told Indian Express that her brother was тАЬattacked only because he was a DalitтАЭ. Quoting a police officer, the paper said that the village where Sakthivel was attacked was dominated by Vanniyars, which falls under Other Backward Class (OBC) category in the state. The victim belongs to the Scheduled Caste Adi Dravida community. Recounting the sequence of events, Theivanai narrates that Sakthivel had received a call from colleagues at the petrol pump on Wednesday to reach with his Aadhaar card and photo for official verification. As he was leaving home around 1:30 pm, he told his sister that there was hardly any fuel in his two-wheeler. A little later, Sakthivel called to say that he had run out of petrol. тАЬHe said he would try to push the bike for a kilometre or two and that he had asked a friend to get petrol in a bottle. But just before he hung up, he said he had a pain in his stomach and that he had been feeling the urge to defecate for a while. He said he would sit by the roadside,тАЭ Theivanai told Express. After some time, Theivanai got a call from her brotherтАЩs phone number. тАЬтАжI asked if he had reached his office. But there was a different voice at the other end. The man said they had tied Sakthivel up and that he was in their custody. He asked me to reach Boothur Hills (about 5 km from their home). It was clear there was some problem,тАЭ she said. She got a ride on a relativeтАЩs two-wheeler and rushed to the spot, carrying her six-month-old baby. тАЬWhen we reached, Sakthivel was bleeding profusely from his mouth and nose and some 15-20 people had gathered around him. When I reached, they beat him some more. I tried to stop them and pleaded for help, but they kicked me and my child fell to the ground. Sakthivel could hardly talk but he signalled for me to leave with the child,тАЭ she said. Also read: Weeks After Rape and Murder of Dalit Woman, Modasa Case Still Shrouded in Mystery The police reached the venue about two hours after Sakthivel was tied up and asked the sister-brother duo to go home. Theivanai said that they had planned to go home on the way to the hospital to get money for treatment. However, when they got home on the two-wheeler, Sakthivel dropped to the ground. тАЬHe was unconscious all along but we didnтАЩt know that he was dead. Later, doctors at the nearby hospital said he had been brought dead,тАЭ she said. Indian Express also reported that there was accusation that Sakthivel had тАШflashedтАЩ a woman. A senior police officer said that since the victim had removed his jeans fully before squatting, a woman working at site nearby thought he was flashing. тАЬWe are probing further,тАЭ he said. Theivanai strongly refuted the accusation and noted that the mob was constantly referring to his caste. тАЬHe dropped out after Class 10 and started working when he was very young. He got me and my younger sister married. Earlier, he used to carry huge cement sacks to make a living. After the mob caught him, they checked his Aadhaar card and noted his caste name. While attacking him, they kept abusing him and calling out our caste name,тАЭ she said. In a tweet, Congress spokesperson Sunil Ahire posted a screenshot from the video showing Sakthivel sitting on the ground with his hands and feet tied. тАЬWe cease to be humans anymore, we should hang our heads in shame,тАЭ he tweeted.

The elder son is seven years old while the younger is one and a half years old. Dinesh Kumar Khatik was one of the individuals killed in anti-Hindu riots in Delhi. OpIndia had a conversation with Dinesh Kumar KhatikтАЩs brother Suresh and he clearly said that his brotherтАЩs life has been taken by jihad тАУ the jihad of Islamic fundamentalists. He said that the whole of Mustafabad killed his brother. By Mustafabad, he meant a Muslim dominated area. This is how the gruesome murder unfolded. Dinesh Kumar Khatik is survived by his wife and two children. The elder son is seven years old while the younger is one and a half years old. He had gone to get milk for his two children on the 26th of February and due to the closure of shops, he had to go farther. During this, he passed by the school of Faisal Farooq. While he was passing by, the riotous Muslim mob was rampaging through the streets with petrol bombs along with firing and stone-pelting. Just then, a bullet from the rioters hit DineshтАЩs head and he passed away. Advocate Monica Arora has also approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide compensation and justice to the victimтАЩs family. When OpIndia team reached the house of the deceased Dinesh, the atmosphere there was very turbid. There were some people who were taking note of the statements of the victims. They were referring to themselves as a committee of the court. Talking to them, Suresh said that his only demand from the government is that every madarsa and mosque should be searched so that the Muslim mobs cannot store dangerous weapons from now on. Suresh also reiterated this during a conversation with OpIndia. Others present there told OpIndia that bullets had been shot in the head, eyes and neck of the victimized Hindus. They told that weapons made of iron were stored and kept, with which the heads of Hindus were being attacked. People are still scared. The people of Prem Nagar and Prem Vihar, while narrating their grief to us, told us that their trust has been lost from the police administration. Hence, they are forced to stay awake every night and protect their lives. Especially for the safety of women at home they have to do this. Suresh made a very big charge while talking to us. He said that if the sticks and knives are found in the house of the Hindus, then the police throws them in jail, while weapons are kept in the house of the Muslims and absolutely nothing is done about it. тАЬрдореЗрд░реЗ рднрд╛рдИ рдХреЛ рдореБрд╕рд▓рдорд╛рдиреЛрдВ рдиреЗ рдорд╛рд░рд╛ рд╣реИред рдмрдбрд╝реА-рдмрдбрд╝реА рдЗрдорд╛рд░рддреЛрдВ рдкрд░ 300-300 рдХреА рд╕рдВрдЦреНрдпрд╛ рдореЗрдВ рдореБрд╕реНрд▓рд┐рдо рдЪрдврд╝реЗ рд╣реБрдП рдереЗ рдФрд░ рдЧреЛрд▓реАрдмрд╛рд░реА рдХрд░ рд░рд╣реЗ рдереЗредтАЭ -рджрд▓рд┐рдд рд╕рдореБрджрд╛рдп рд╕реЗ рдЖрдиреЗ рд╡рд╛рд▓реЗ рджрд┐рдиреЗрд╢ рдЦрдЯреАрдХ рдХреЛ рджрдВрдЧрд╛рдЗрдпреЛрдВ рдиреЗ рдорд╛рд░ рдбрд╛рд▓рд╛ред рдЙрдирдХреЗ рджреЛ рдЫреЛрдЯреЗ-рдЫреЛрдЯреЗ рдмрдЪреНрдЪреЗ рд╣реИрдВред рдЙрдирдХреЗ рднрд╛рдИ рд╕реБрд░реЗрд╢ рдиреЗ @OpIndia_in рд╕реЗ рдмрд╛рддрдЪреАрдд рдХреАред рд╣рд┐рдВрджреБрдУрдВ рдХреА рдмрд▓рд┐ рдХрдм рддрдХ? https://t.co/KPfwhFfN0d pic.twitter.com/30ZUA7oNNm тАФ Anupam K Singh ??

Over the course of around four years, Meghwanshi grew to harbour a visceral hatred for Muslims and began to take immense pride in his Hindu identity. He dedicated himself to the cause of the RSSтАЩs Hindu Rashtra, even receiving military training by the organisation. But after facing discrimination within the RSS, he realised that its vision is different for caste Hindus and Dalits. Meghwanshi is now a journalist and an activist. His book Main Ek Karsevak ThaтАФI Was a KarsevakтАФwas first published in Hindi in 2019 and its English translation, I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, was published by Navayana in January this year. That month, Sushil Kumar, an independent journalist, spoke to Meghwanshi about the RSSтАЩs process of indoctrinating its cadre, its glorification of violence and its vision for a Hindu Rashtra. Sushil Kumar: In which period were you in the RSS?Bhanwar Meghwanshi: I was active from 1987 to 1991. I participated in the first тАЬkarasevaтАЭ of 1990. I had left home to dismantle the Babri Masjid [in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Ayodhya], but did not reach, as the [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam SinghтАЩs government was in power. At that time, we used to call him тАЬMulla-yamтАЭ Singh, meaning тАЬmaulana Mulayam.тАЭ His government arrested me, near the Tundla station, and kept me in the Agra jail for some ten days. By then, whatever karaseva had to take place had taken place. Then I returned home. SK: Were there any women at the shakha?BM: At the shakha, all were men. We talked only about purusharth, male dominance. It is evident that there was no place for women. Seen one way, the meaning of purushartha is masculinity, patriarchy. SK: What did you learn during your time as a swayamsevak?BM: I got to learn many things. First thing, I evidently became a reactionary. The second thing I learnt was to imagine everyone who was not from my village and panchayat as an enemy, and fight them, defeat them and hate them. Sushil Kumar is an independent journalist.

On March 18, there was a very unusual scenario in this village. A person belonging to a higher caste(Reddy community) passed away. There was an unusual delay in the final death rituals. When enquired it came to know that the Dalits of the village rejected to be part of death rituals like doing all odd works for the dead and playing band in the death possession. No Dalit came forward in the entire village to take up the job. Finally, all the odd jobs even playing off the death band was done by the upper class (Reddy community). This strong rejection from Dalit community was in response to the higher community rejecting the installation of Babasaheb Ambedkar Statue in front of the panchayat office in the village. The Dalits of the village wanted to install the statue of Babasaheb in the open land in front of the panchayat office and they requested for the permission for the same. But the village sarpanch belonging to higher caste (reddy) opposed it. He said he will get permission to install statues of Shivaji Maharaj or Swami Vivekananda but he will not let them install a statue of Babasaheb. Retaliating to this the Dalits called for a Dalit community meeting on 18 March morning. Dalit community heads decided Dalits of the village will not work for any upper caste. The Dalits will lead a free and dignified life. Nobody can force them to work the way they used to for centuries. It was unanimously decided that Dalits will not play bands on deaths or on marriages of the higher community as per custom. Dalit leaders Mr.K. Ramu, Mr. K Katagiri, Mr. G Vijay, Mr. K lachayya, Mr. Malesham, Mr. Laxman and Mr. K Prasad said that this decision of the community will be strictly followed and if any Dalit found violating this unanimous decision of this community then he/she will be dealt very strictly and they will be thrown out of the community along with their family and near relations. A similar rejection of the upper community by Dalits took place in a remote village named Ramadugu Karimnagar. Here Dalit community also decided that they will not take up any odd job offered by upper caste. They will lead to dignified life breaking centuries-old customs.

Similarly, every third Muslim is multi-dimensionally poor as are two in five children under the age of 10, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)тАЩs global multidimensional poverty index (MPI), 2018. The term multidimensional means poor not only on the basis of income but on other indicators such as nutrition, health, education, living standards and assets, this is how the report released on Thursday mentioned. The report found that 50 per cent of all tribals in the country are poor as are 33 per cent of Dalits and 33 per cent of Muslims. Overall, India still has the largest number of people living in multidimensional poverty in the world at 364 million or around 27 per cent of the countryтАЩs population. Of this, as many as 34.5 per cent are children. Moreover, 8.6 per cent of the countryтАЩs population lives in тАЬsevere povertyтАЭ, according to the report. The report ranks India as having the largest number of poor in absolute numbers on account of its population, while in terms of the proportion of poor, India is the 54th poorest country among the 105 surveyed. Niger tops this list. The report reflects how IndiaтАЩs most vulnerable sections continue to remain at the bottom of the pyramid. On the other hand, report finds that the so-called upper castes fare far better on the MPI scale тАФ only 15 per cent of the тАШupperтАЩ castes are poor. The positive indicator in the report is that the poverty rate in India has gone down significantly in the 10 years тАФ from 55 per cent in 2005-06 to 28 per cent in 2015-16. According to the report, the poorest groups тАФ spanning across states, castes, religions and age groups тАФ have had the highest reduction in MPI during 2005-06 and 2015-16. For instance, while 80 per cent of the Scheduled Tribe had been poor in 2005-06, the figure has gone down to 50 per cent in 2015-16, says the report. State-wise, Bihar, followed by Jharkhand, are the poorest states with 52 per cent and 45 per cent of their population respectively identified as living in multidimensional poverty. In Kerala, which is the best performer, only 1 per cent of population falls in the category. The causes of multidimensional poverty across states seem consistent тАФ while poor nutrition is the largest contributor and responsible for 28.3 per cent of IndiaтАЩs MPI, not having a household member with at least six years of education is the second largest contributor at 16 per cent. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government has decided to ensure piped drinking water to all rural households by 2024, the inadequate access to clean water and child mortality contribute the least, at 2.8 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. To address the issue of poor nutrition, the Food Security Act was introduced in 2013 by the then Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government to provide subsidised foodgrains to the poor. Lack of education, meanwhile, may have led to the inability to access employment, thus contributing to poverty. Dear Reader, Independent and honest journalism is not possible without public support.

"167",1607,"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-palasa-1978-important-telugu-film-documenting-dalit-resistance-119946","Why 'Palasa 1978' is an important Telugu film documenting Dalit resistance","Films on caste oppression have usually depicted Dalits as a homogeneous oppressed community, but Palasa is a much more nuanced and historically authentic depiction. (Spoilers ahead) Telugu films are usually in the news for the buzz generated by their cast, crew and massive pre-release events. However, once in a while, films like Palasa 1978 garner attention due to their content and understanding of social history. The film, directed by Karuna Kumar, begins with bloodshed. After the title song, we hear the drum beats of a jatara (carnival), and the protagonist Mohan Rao (Rakshit), a Dalit man, beheads Ganapavasu, another Dalit man. The latter is a henchman of the Shavukarus, dominant caste Hindu landlords. While films on caste oppression have usually depicted Dalits as a homogeneous oppressed community, Palasa is a much more nuanced and historically authentic depiction of the violence that├в┬А┬Щs meted out in the name of caste. As the title suggests, the story takes place in Palasa in Andhra Pradesh's Srikakulam district. The year, according to the director, is a nod to certain incidents that reportedly took place in Palasa at that time, and continued for almost four decades. The narrative is interspersed with shots of cashew mills and coconut fields that dot the north coastal region of the state. Dandasi (Laxman), a close friend of Mohan Rao, and a retired police officer, are the narrators of this story which is set in Ambusoli 'colony'. This is where a Dalit artist community ekes out a living by working in cashewnut processing mills that are mostly owned by dominant caste Hindus. Pitting Dalits against Dalits Both Mohan Rao and his elder brother Ranga Rao (Thiruveer) believe in violence as a remedy. The former, especially, is convinced that anyone who hurts their self-respect deserves to be dealt with severely. The director seems to have been inspired by books like Kalyan Rao's Antarani Vasantam (Untouchable Spring) in Telugu and Roots by Alex Haley, in charting out a journey to explore the structural violence on Dalits and their struggles. The characters of Peddasavukaru (Jenny), the main antagonist, and Chinnasavukaru (Raghu Kunche), show how dominant castes go to any extent to retain their power in a village. It├в┬А┬Щs still a common practice for dominant castes, at least in the parts I come from, to pitch one Dalit against another. However, such portrayals are rare in cinema. In a crucial scene in Palasa, Peddasavukaru makes Ranga Rao feel ├в┬А┬Шspecial├в┬А┬Щ by making him sit close. He also serves Ranga Rao his food. In another scene, Peddasavukaru├в┬А┬Щs son, Tarakesh, tries to placate Mohan Rao├в┬А┬Щs brother-in-law by giving him money. However, despite their attempts, the two dominant caste men fail to turn them against Mohan Rao. In Untouchable Spring, Kalyan Rao writes about how dominant caste landlords create a rift between two vulnerable Dalit communities. In Palasa, the director also shows the rift within the same community. Mohan Rao grows up with Laxmi (Nakshatra ) and eventually marries her. She├в┬А┬Щs a great artist in her brother Muthyalu├в┬А┬Щs troop. However, Ganapavasu accidentally kills her while trying to shoot Mohan Rao to avenge his father├в┬А┬Щs death. Ganapavasu, like many Dalit youngsters in the late 1980s and ├в┬А┬Ш90s, joins the Naxalite movement. While many joined the movement genuinely believing that they can bring about change, some like Ganapavasu signed up for it to have power over their own people (the oppressed). He later returns, only to be pitted against Mohan Rao. Dalit characters on screen are almost never represented and if they are, they are usually painted by the same broad brush. In Palasa, however, Karuna Kumar marks the contrast in the personalities of Bairagi (Uma Maheshwar Rao), a Dalit man working for Peddasavukaru, his son Ganapavasu, and the two Rao brothers. The movie is also loaded with historical references to caste atrocities in the Telugu states, from Karamchedu (1985) to Tsunduru (1991), and even the more recent Laximipeta (2012). ├в┬А┬ШEducate, agitate, organise├в┬А┬Щ The resistance is not limited to the male characters alone. Ranga Rao's partner Gajula Gowri is shown as a bold woman. When the Dalits try to take water from a tank in the field belonging to the dominant castes, she gets into a confrontation with the latter. A dominant caste man humiliates them saying, ├в┬А┬ЬToday you ask for water, tomorrow you will take a bath in this!├в┬А┬Э Gowri points out that dominant caste men don't think about the caste of Dalit women when making sexual advances or committing rape. In the second half, the story of Sebastian (Vijay Ram), a sincere and law-abiding Dalit police officer who hails from the manual scavenging community, depicts the struggle of a first generation police officer who├в┬А┬Щs striving to bring change through education. ""In my childhood, my father showed me a great man's idol...with a book in one hand and his finger pointing towards our goal,├в┬А┬Э Sebastian tells Mohan Rao. It is these words that transform Mohan Rao and make him ├в┬А┬Шeducate, agitate and organise├в┬А┬Щ within the framework of the Indian Constitution. But though this gives the viewer some hope, it is deflated when years later, Sebastian himself wants Mohan Rao to choose violence. The former realises that he couldn├в┬А┬Щt deliver justice to the people after all, thereby throwing light on the harsh reality of how Indian democracy functions. Palasa shows that when there is oppression everywhere, Dalits have no choice but to embrace resistance - as said in Untouchable Spring, ""For us, resistance is not an ideal, but mandatory."" In the last scene, when Mohan Rao surrenders to the police with two severed heads, he says, ├в┬А┬ЬIf I had been the same Mohan Rao of the past, the third bag would have had the head of Tarakesh.├в┬А┬Э He reiterates that his people are looking for change, for a society where everyone can live with equal respect and dignity. As he walks into the cell at the police station, he says that he wishes to see a society which will not have Dalits killing themselves on university campuses and murders happening over intercaste marriage. In Mohan Rao├в┬А┬Щs last shot, the portrait of Dr BR Ambedkar can be seen next to him on the wall outside the cell. This suggests that the struggle has not come to an end but that this is actually a new beginning towards a more humane society. Mohan Rao's legacy can be continued if the resistance is in multiple forms - entering the bureaucracy, politics, judiciary, media and each field that dominant caste Hindus have monopolised, besides also being ready to confront oppression whenever required. The movie also celebrates the Srikakulam dialect, which is otherwise belittled or confined to comedians, despite its rich cultural and literary heritage. An average Telugu person from the other end of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh like me, may not understand the Srikakulam dialect otherwise, but Karuna Kumar, who is also the writer of the film, eases us in by choosing each word in a sentence according to the context. At a time when mainstream Telugu cinema mainly has protagonists from three-four districts, namely the Krishna, Guntur and twin Godavari districts, and a few dominant castes, leaving only comic or villain roles for the rest, Palasa 1978 comes as a welcome change.  ┬й2021 the news minute","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

According to the police, the body of Rao was found in the Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Khairatabad on Sunday morning. The wife of Rao had claimed that he had been missing since Saturday. Police said they have not registered a case and it appeared that Rao had taken his own life.  ""Maruti Rao was found dead in the morning. He has committed suicide, the case has not yet registered. Further investigation underway,"" Saifabad Deputy Commissioner of Police said. He was the main accused in the murder of Pranay Perumalla, the 24-year-old Dalit man who was killed in September 2018. Perumalla was married to Amrutha, the daughter of Rao, who was against the marriage as the boy was a Dalit while Rao's family belonged to the upper caste. Pranay belonged to Madiga scheduled caste whereas Amrutha was from Vysya caste.  Perumalla was hacked to death by a hitman hired by Rao, in front of his mother and Amrutha who was pregnant at the time, outside a hospital in Miryalaguda while they were stepping out. The entire incident was caught on CCTV camera and had sent shockwaves across the state and the country. The CCTV images revealed that the attacker had conducted the recce of the area. Amrutha later told police that she suspected her father, Maruthi Rao, to be behind the murder because her family was against their marriage and wanted to have her child aborted.  He had allegedly paid Rs 1 crore to get Perumalla killed. During the investigation, it came to light that the assassins had made four previous attempts to kill him, but had failed. Rao, who was arrested in the case, was out on bail. In June last year, the police had filed the charge sheet in the case naming Rao as the prime accused and seven others, including Subash Sharma - the man who hacked Perumalla to death. Family members alleged that he ended life due to the harassment by the police. Amrutha, however, felt that her father could have ended his life due to the guilt of killing Pranay ""We have no clarity yet, my father might have committed suicide due to regret after they killed Pranay. I never spoke to him nor saw him after that."" Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time, has since given birth to a baby boy. Start a conversation, not a fire. Post with kindness.

No one else could have carved a niche for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and the Minorities as much as he did. He came on the Indian political scene without a resum├й popping with credentials of legacy, inheritance, wealth, title, surname or party. Irrespective of all these barriers, he sculpted a solid, unremitting, electrifying Bahujan movement in India. He hailed from an agriculturist Chamar family, but being a Sikh had no impact on caste exclusions of Dalits in the region. Kanshiram, born on March 15, 1934, was aware of this, yet not to the extent of grasping the nuances of such discrimination. He had naively thought of Brahmins as being a poor and backward community due to their low status in Jaat-dominant Punjab. Also read | Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram тАФ so alike, yet so different In his later life, there was one incident in his diverse working stints that had an impact on him. In 1957, he settled for a job as a research assistant in the Ministry of DefenceтАЩs Explosives Research and Development Laboratory (also called the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory), in Pune. A colleague, a class IV employee, Dinabhana from RajasthanтАЩs Bhangi caste, had taken it upon himself to protest the administrationтАЩs cancellation of holidays for Ambedkar and Buddha Jayanti. As a consequence, he was fired for raising the issue. He chose to fight it in court. Looking at DinabhanaтАЩs unrelenting struggle, Kanshiram turned towards activism to seek social justice and political freedoms. Much of KanshiramтАЩs memories are lived through anecdotes and his speeches. A.R. Akela, a foremost scholar of the Bahujan movement, has compiled a series and published them in Hindi. It must be noted that Kanshiram did not leave extensive written records or archives barring the classic, The Chamcha Age (An Era of the Stooge). Dedicated to Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, The Chamcha Age was later to be the founding ground of a party that would be a disrupter in IndiaтАЩs casteist political spectrum тАФ the Bahujan Samaj Party. Kanshiram started by wanting to do nothing with the tokenised, genuflecting leadership of Dalit leaders that the Poona Pact between Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar had produced. Such a leadership was willing to be the secondary elements of the dominant Congress party. Review of Kanshiram тАФ Leader of the Dalits: A look back at the colourful history of a bahujan leader Following simmering resentment against the political attitude towards Dalits, Kanshiram gathered middle class government employees who were seeking leadership that had a spine and self-pride. He recruited disgruntled intellectuals and government employees to give wheels to the caravan of the Bahujan movement. In current times, KanshiramтАЩs struggle continues to be more popular and his ideas acceptable to second and third generation Dalits who are unwilling to settle for anything less than what they deserve. Educated and with a confident outlook, the young breed of Dalits are now aiming to give life to AmbedkarтАЩs vision тАФ of becoming a part of the ruling class of the country. Through Kanshiram they see a feasible, methodical approach to getting that throne. Almost every student organisation, social and political outfit subscribes to the legacy of Ambedkar. The Bhim Army Ekta Mission, for instance, wants to be seen as a part of KanshiramтАЩs Ambedkarite legacy. The Bhim ArmyтАЩs status is complicated on a national scale. Though its flamboyant leader, Chandrashekhar Azad, has an appeal across caste, religion and regional lines, the organisationтАЩs social base has still to be firmed up. Its apolitical work such as pre-school training, having an atrocity grievance cell and cultural activism needs to be expanded. There needs to be a multi-organisational strategy. Also read | The Bahujan movement needs to reinvent itself There are several Bahujan organisations that work towards Dr. AmbedkarтАЩs dream of a non-caste India. But the origins of this can be traced back to the BAMCEF, or the All India Backward (SC, ST, and OBC) and Minority Communities Employees Federation. Along with his colleagues, Kanshiram began one of the largest unions of government employees. Through BAMCEF, he connected SC, ST, OBCs, and other minorities to fight back against atrocities and discrimination. With a structure in place, he was able to help create a strong sense of accountability towards the community. Thus, the widely popular initiative тАШPay Back to SocietyтАЩ was inaugurated in 1973. As a part of BAMCEF there were simultaneous initiatives such as the BAMCEF Datta Grahan, -Bhaichara, -Sahkarita. In 1981, the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS-4) with 10 wings (students, women, etc.) was established to experiment with socio-political possibilities. Eventually the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was formally established in 1984. Kanshiram declared that he wanted the community to become givers rather than receivers. For that to happen it required training and preparation. Cadre camps and various events filled the gap. Instead of downplaying the importance of caste, Kanshiram opted to strengthen oppressed caste associations which was one way to weaken the structures that sustain caste. Every тАШupperтАЩ caste had an investment in caste, which is why it transferred this into structures that catered to its needs. Kanshiram invested in the cultures of caste and cultural methods of anti-casteism. He understood well that artists and in turn their art were organic intellectuals who were a part of the grass-roots. He sought them out and trained them. It is no accident that the тАШAmbedkar Mela on WheelsтАЩ was among the many first Dalit History Month projects that featured AmbedkarтАЩs photographs, books, pamphlets and posters. Also read | Mayawati, rebel leaders fight for Kanshi RamтАЩs legacy Kanshiram understood that emotional appeal was a far more powerful way to use radical anger that would help tackle the oppressor. Thus, the artwork and paintings depicting atrocities on the communities played a pivotal role in his outreach initiatives. He had grasped early on that while emotions are essential, a strategy was also needed to direct peopleтАЩs thoughts into producing material. His deft editorial skills also found expression. The popular The Oppressed Indian and the Bahujan Sanghatak were his organisationтАЩs mouthpieces. There were others that dealt with land reform, nationalisation of industries and a labour welfare regime such as Aarthik Utthan (1980) and Economic Monthly (1981) in addition to the impressive Bahujan Times (1984). Kanshiram can be said to be the leader who introduced Periyar to villages in north, central, eastern and western India. Like Periyar, there were many unsung heroes who were given space on the canvas of the BSP. They include Nandanar, Iyothee Thass, Nangeli, Birsa Munda, Savitribai Phule and Jhalkaribai. In hindsight, we are yet to find similar investments by his prot├йg├йs. There are certainly no intellectual research wings, as was the case earlier, which can provide guidance to the movement. There is no media that can converse with the public on a daily basis on Dalit issues; neither is there any trust-building mechanism. Finally, moving to the present state of the BSP, it appears that the party leadership lacks a committed young cadre that can be trained to take over the reins of the leadership. KanshiramтАЩs legacy remains alive and kicking in the words of the BSPтАЩs chief Mayawati. But in the absence of any credible sourcing of talent, organisations such as the Bhim Army and many BAMCEF-BSP inspired regional parties could step in and fill the vacuum.

Youth, women's groups, activists and ordinary citizens came together to decry the heinous crime and the insensitive manner in which the Uttar Pradesh government handled the incident. The past few weeks have been reminiscent of the pre-Covid-19 times when people protested the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of the BJP-led government in 2019. This time, around 5,000 people gathered at the Jantar Mantar protest in Delhi that was originally planned to be held at India Gate. Despite the last-minute change in venue, people arrived at the spot to denounce the atrocity suffered by the 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras. A video by a member of the If We Do Not Rise interviewed various people at the protest to show the varying demands of the protesters. While some people demanded stringent punishment for the accused, other participants voiced the rising caste-based crimes in Uttar Pradesh.

The speeches also voiced a concern about the increasing fascism, growing violence and saffronisation of the police and judicial system.

But for the Dalits, the meaning of freedom was incomplete without the community breaking away from the clutches of Brahmanism. For them, the тАШrealтАЩ colonisation constituted the rules and diktats of Brahmanical society (caste system), under which they were treated as outcasts. For them, the real colonisers were and have always been Brahmins. Time and again, their literature speaks this truth. From the year 1925, as the decline of British rule started becoming a conceivable reality, the plan to colonise Dalits and consequently other lower castes, including Adivasis, was set in motion with the birth of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). What had pushed the need for RSS, as felt by Brahmins, was the threat to their dominance in an independent nation, imagined on democratic, secular, and just principles, as prescribed by the Indian Constitution. From the beginning, the agenda of the RSS was to bring all Dalits, Adivasis, and other lower caste communities under the umbrella of 'Hinduism'. These marginalised communities, however, had their own histories, deities, cultures, languages, and ideas of life. The RSSтАЩs function was to examine and uproot said communities from their origins of being and belonging, and construct a new history for them that must support the dominance of Brahmins. Consequently, said upper-caste dominant community is now suddenly feeling threatened by the liberty, equality and fraternity constitutionally bestowed upon each citizen of the bygone-British India. Once you are uprooted from your history, and a new history built by the dominant caste is imposed on you, you are bound to hate your own kith and kin. While the British coloniser exploits your labour, the Brahmin coloniser exploits your history. With labour gone, you are filled with rage; but with history gone, you are filled with confusion. Bhanwar Meghwanshi. Facebook/bm075 This new history is constructed around myths concocted by Brahmins, in which you are given a place in the тАШnational imaginationтАЩ, but in disguise. What now compels the Dalit, the Adivasi, and the lower caste youth to be a part of it is an infatuation of patriotism, a newly found enemy to accuse, fiery speeches, rhetoric of hate, and the тАШdivineтАЩ idea of working for the motherland, or the 'matrubhoomi'. In his book The Wretched of the Earth, post-colonial theorist and philosopher Frantz Fanon explains that the ""youth of a colonised country, growing up in an atmosphere of shot and fire, may well make a mock of, and does not hesitate to pour scorn upon the zombies of his ancestors, the horses with two heads, the dead who rise again and the djinns who rush into your body while you yawn.тАЭ The story of Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a Dalit youth who was associated with the RSS as a Karsevak, elucidates what Fanon tried to explain. But his account, as told in his book I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, is also one of breaking free from the mental colonisation by the Brahmins through the RSS. When your body is used for its labor to spread vicious propaganda, but you are rejected as a mind and a human being with dignity, it then generates strong repulsion for the propaganda you so far dedicated your life to. This experience is curiously revealing in a caste-based society, and one doesn't 'understand' the gravity of caste discrimination unless is it 'felt' or 'experienced'. In case of the young Bhanwar Meghwanshi, the RSS had been an organisation with almost a sacred vision: the creation of the 'Hindu Rashtra'. Through the propaganda, he was raised through his youth and made to feel like a тАШproudтАЩ Hindu. It was only when the food from his home was refused and thrown away by upper caste-Brahmin Swayamsewaks, that he came to taste the poison of caste and discrimination in their entirety тАФ the founding principle of the 'Hindu Rashtra' and the RSS. About this, he dejectedly writes: тАЬFor the first time in my life that day, I stepped aside from my Hindu identity and started seeing the world like a person from a lower caste. My troubled thoughts kept me awake all night, a night that felt endless.тАЭ Through his stint in the RSS, he was raised as a proud Hindu. However, later, he was viciously rejected as a Dalit; as the one unabatedly questioning the myths fed by the RSS to innocent Dalits, Adivasis and lower caste youth. There's another instance in which his aspirations to become an RSS Pracharak was mutilated by asinine, baseless responses from Savarna leaders, and which revealed to him the hypocrisy of the organisation. This is exactly where we understand the functioning of caste in India. Thus far, the youth of the country across castes, reeling under Brahmin colonisation, was being manipulated by mythical and baseless answers from the RSS, which constantly preached about being an 'Other Superior', while simultaneously being made to feel exploited by enemies of other religions. Youth in India, scattered across hundreds of castes and never sharing a monolithic history, is now made to feel a 'proud' Hindu. Meghwanshi's years in the RSS reveal this trajectory of creation of a new identity, which is then used to mobilise people as a singular force, and propagate the agenda of Brahmins. In a broader sense, after his bitter experience of being exploited by the RSS, he goes on to open up a dialogue with other Dalits from the organisation, only to realise that his distinct understanding of the prejudiced and vicious ways of the RSS is also shared by many from these castes. He felt he is not alone, when it comes to being cheated by the Sangh. He also discovers that discrimination in the RSS is not limited to him, but is a norm practiced in terms of treating people from marginalised and lower caste communities. Though many of them did not talk about their agonies, his comprehension of the RSS is shared by many. He says: тАЬFor the first time I saw that this was not my personal pain, but that of every swayamsevak of my community. The difference was that they were willing to accept it quietly, and I was not.тАЭ Bhanwar Meghwanshi. Facebook/bm075 This, in turn, has given birth to a rebel within him. A Dalit, who's experienced first-hand the agenda of the RSS and its lethality for Dalits, Adivasis and other lower caste communities, decided to fight against it. This fight is primarily shaped by the intellectual quest for his history, his vision to resurrect the history of Dalits, which is appropriated by the RSS, and making people aware of the scope of acquiring dignity and a human personality that is guaranteed by the Constitution of India. While facing countless threats from the RSS as he works tirelessly to fulfil Ambedkar, Phule, Kabir, and the Buddha's visions, he, however, does not fall prey to regressive positions. But despite all of this, a vision of the world rooted in love seems like a definite possibility to him, as he invokes Kabir while writing about the idea of love in his life: тАЬOf course, life is not simple, nothing is as straightforward as it might appear on the surface, there are ups and downs. It has sometimes felt as if we are life partners only in name, but the two and a half letters that Kabir says make up the word prem (dhai aakhar prem ka) - this love has always survived every trial. My life with Prem, my marriage to her, has taught me that at any point in life one could meet someone, at any point lose someone, one never knows. It is all a matter of fortuity. But I am grateful for the countless blessings in my life, and my heartfelt desire is that there comes a day when the words тАШloveтАЩ and тАШlifeтАЩ become synonymous.тАЭ Who else could understand the profound and true meaning of revolution, than the one whose idea of life is synonymous to love? тАФ That too while fighting the most vicious enemy in the world: the colonisers of the mind тАФ the Brahmins, the RSS.

Madan Lal Meena, 75, passed away at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur, where he was brought in a serious condition. The police have so far arrested five accused in the case. ""Jitendra Yadav, Bharatbhushan, Dilip Singh, Sandeep Meena and Sandeep Yadav have been arrested in the case, Dinesh Agrawal, Additional SP, said. Anil Yadav, another person named in the matter is absconding. The man, Madan Lal Meena, was beaten up in Rajasthan's Sikar district by five men, who suspected him of stealing mobile phones from a Bhandaara or a large place meant for collective eating. The incident took place on March 4. A video of the old man being brutally beaten up by the accused in the case went viral on the social media on March 5. Thereafter, the old man's son got an FIR registered in the matter on March 8. The police has failed to nab any of the accused in the case so far. The victim of the brutal assault was admitted at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur with grave injuries to his body. A metal rod had to be inserted in the foot of the man and his hip bone had broken allegedly because of the brutal assault. In the video, the old man can be heard swearing by his son, claiming that he has not stolen the mobiles. However, the accused persons kept beating him up even mercilessly. After some time, they left as the old man kept writhing in pain. The accused men had allegedly abducted the old man on suspicion of stealing five mobile phones from the Khatu Shyam Ji's fair in Rajasthan's Sikar district. They were working in the catering section of the Bhandara. Madan Lal Meena was abducted in a jeep and taken to a deserted place two kilometres. The man's son got an FIR registered in the case on March 8. Kanaram, son of Madan Lal, is a police constable currently posted in Delhi.

Devji Maheshwari, 50, was murdered in broad daylight in Rapar taluka of Kutch district, Gujarat, on September 26. He was a senior activist associated with All India Backward and Minority Communities (BAMCEF) and member of Indian Legal Professionals Associations and was involved in various struggles, including for land rights for dalits. The Kutch police claimed that Maheshwari was killed for his social media posts against Brahmins, but the advocateтАЩs wife has alleged that there was more to it than meets the eye as he was involved in fighting for land and property rights of dalits. Bharat Raval, a 22-year-old resident of Malad, Mumbai and native of Rapar, Kutch, belonging to brahmin community, was arrested by the local police in less than 24 hours of MaheshwariтАЩs murder after he was identified from a CCTV footage. In the footage, Raval is seen waiting outside MaheshwariтАЩs office, follows him inside and runs out minutes later. Maheshwari is seen coming out after Raval, with his shirt soaked in blood, reportedly from multiple stab wounds. He succumbed to his injuries before he could be taken to a hospital. In accordance with local police, Raval confessed that, тАЬhe could not take MaheshwariтАЩs anti-Hindu and anti-brahmin Facebook posts anymore.тАЭ Reportedly, Maheshwari and Raval had a spat repeatedly over the past one month. Rava had warned Maheshwari to not create trouble as they hailed from same village. He had also threatened Maheshwari in his office once. The last Facebook post by Maheshwari was a video of Waman Meshram, National President of BAMCEF, saying that people belonging to Schedule Castes, Scheduled tribes and Other Backward Classes are not Hindus. Mumbai Police, who arrested Raval and handed him over to Gujarat police, said he travelled on September 23 with an intention to kill Maheshwari. He was arrested under various sections of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act, charges of murder and criminal conspiracy. Notably, Minaxiben Maheshwari, wife of the deceased advocate, has alleged that the murder was part of larger conspiracy than a spat over social media post. The FIR which was registered based on complaint by Minaxiben Maheshwari stated, тАЬDevji Maheshwari left his residence at around 7.30 am on the day in a private vehicle for Bhuj for a legal matter in connection with a property case that involved Luhar Community Hall (a land dispute between two communities). He returned at around 3.30 left for his office. No lawyer was ready to take the case of the community hall and my husband did. He used to keep the papers related to the case with and tried in vain to lodge a FIR in the matter. The rival party had threatened to kill my husband several times as he was in possession of those papers. It is my suspicion that they hired Bharat Raval to kill him.тАЭ Gujarat police has also named eight others in the FIR, of which five have been arrested so far. Noticeably, dalits from Rapar and neighbouring areas erupted in protest and refused to accept the body until accused are arrested. The protestors blocked highways and burnt tyres as a mark of protest. MaheshwariтАЩs body that was kept in a government hospital was accepted later by the family. In January this year, a dalit girl was found hanging from a tree in Sabarkantha district. While family alleged that she was raped and killed by upper caste men of the village, an SIT formed to investigate the case declared victim was neither raped nor murdered. In July, a 27 year old dalit youth was kidnapped and killed by upper caste men of his village for suspicion of theft. He was the sole earner of his family. In 2019, a data compiled by Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe Cell Gandhinagar, revealed that 568 cases of caste atrocity were registered till May of which 16 murder cases, 30 were of grievously hurt and 36 rape cases. In May 2019, Rajesh Sondarva son of a dalit RTI activist was thrashed to death near Rajkot by men accused of killing his father two years ago. The accused were out on bail. In June 2019, Piyush Sarvaiya, brother Lalji Sarvaiya who was burnt alive by an upper caste mob in 2012, was attacked by one of the convicts accused of killing his brother. The accused who attacked Sarvaiya was out on parole at the time. The same month, Manjibhai Solanki, a 55-year-old deputy Sarpanch was attacked with pipes and rods by upper caste men of his village. Solanki who had reportedly irked the upper caste men as he had helped dalits of the village to lodge cases of atrocity against them, succumbed to his injuries on way to hospital. The third incident of caste atrocity in the state in June 2019 was the murder of 34-year-old Prakash Parmar. ParmarтАЩs brother had lodged a complaint against the men belonging to Darbar (Kshatriya) community who attacked him. On July 8, Haresh Solanki, 22-year-old dalit man was hacked to death allegedly by his wifeтАЩs family members who belong to upper caste community. Solanki was attempting to meet his pregnant wife at her parentтАЩs house near Ahmedabad. Between the years 2016 and 2018, dalits have been killed in Gujarat for riding a horse, watching Garba, a traditional Gujarati dance during months of Navratri festival, marrying an upper caste man or woman, raising voice against upper caste men in villages for civil rights.

This is the view of intellectuals and activists on the ground who have been working with this segment of people, aired at a discussion at Punjabi University in Patiala on Friday at the release of a landmark study titled тАШKhise Khali, Thid Bhukhe, Tan Liran: Pendu Punjab De Dalit Aurat Mazdoor Parivaran Da Ik SarvekhanтАЩ (Empty Pockets, Hungry Stomachs, Tatters on the Body: A Survey of Dalit Women Labour Families of Rural Punjab). Compiled by a team - Dharampal, Gurinder Kaur, Veerpal Kaur and Jyoti - directed by economic expert Gian Singh, the survey points to an extremely dismal scenario. These households are living in abject poverty and hardly find any place in the priorities of the heavily embedded media or the political and administrative class. тАЬWe are often told no, the situation cannot be this bad. We counter such people by saying that they should themselves conduct such studies to see for themselves,тАЭ Gian Singh disclosed. Data for the study was collected from 927 Dalit women labour households across four sample districts of Jalandhar, Amritsar, Mansa and Fatehgarh Sahib representing the Doaba, Majha and Malwa regions of Punjab. Besides several other indicators, the study reveals that 61.7% of Dalit women labourers suffer from one or other serious conditions like body aches, diabetes, blood pressure, bronchial problems, heat exhaustion, gynecological problems and the like in the rural areas of Punjab. This is primarily because of unhygienic living conditions and malnutrition. тАЬAs the government hospitals and clinical laboratories are scarcely available in the rural areas, they find no other option than to consult the local medical practitioners for the purpose,тАЭ it says. The survey found that 24.5% of respondents had faced discrimination at the workplace on the basis of their caste. The so-called тАШhigher casteтАЩ employers often use filthy language for them. Further, тАЬIt is pertinent to note that 5.50 per cent of the respondents have faced sexual exploitation at the workplace. Another 23.95 per cent respondents faced no such type of harassment at the workplace. However, majority of the respondents (70.55 per cent) gave no response in this regard. This may have been because of saving their chastity in the society,тАЭ the study says. Activists confirm that the majority of these women face sexual harassment. тАЬThey do not come out and speak about it. It takes multiple interactions to get them to talk on this subject. This is an uncomfortable truth,тАЭ said Kiran of the Kisan Mazdoor Khudkushi Peedit Parivar Committee. тАЬThe reason behind this reluctance is that women are considered to be gehna (jewels) or izzat (pride) of the house,тАЭ added Bimal Kaur of the Krantikari Pendu Mazdoor Union. The study says that due to lack of knowledge about the Minimum Wages Act, 91.9% of rural Dalit women labourers are not aware of the standard working hours fixed under the law. тАЬFurther, 37.32 per cent are not being paid equal wages for equal work with men,тАЭ it underlines. There is also an all important need to ensure these women get full days of employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. It was pointed out at the discussion that the scenario with regard to MGNREGA implementation is pathetic. тАЬHave you ever seen a government drive to popularise MGNREGA? The main question is why it is not being done,тАЭ said economic expert Dr Balwinder Singh Tiwana. Tiwana further said that these women must organise themselves and agitate to get their dues, in a state like Punjab where a semi feudal society prevails. тАЬIt must be understood that doles do not work. The socio-economic structure has to be changed,тАЭ he said, pointing to the non implementation of land reforms. тАЬThe ruling class is cunning. Till the time social discrimination exists, there can be no development.тАЭ It was underlined that land rights to Dalits can take them forward in a big way and land ownership means empowerment for this community. тАЬOn one side we have a situation where bonded labour continues and on the other, working as farm labour or marginal farmers does not make farming remunerative. They need to be given land as it will take them forward. We need a movement towards this direction,тАЭ said Paramjit Kaur of the Zamin Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC) which has been taking forward the fight for land rights to Dalits in Sangrur and adjoining areas of Malwa region of the state. Observing that Dalit women labourers are landless, the study emphasises the need to introduce land reforms in favour of Dalits, who have remained a neglected lot for ages. To substantiate this contention the study points to Balad Kalan village in Sangrur, where under the aegis of ZPSC the Dalit households have been able to take control of village common land on a lease-in basis despite the opposition of many. тАЬIt has provided them a feeling of self-respect. Now the Dalit women do not require to go to the fields of large farmers for fodder, vegetables, and food grains,тАЭ the study reports. In villages where Dalit families have got cultivation rights on common lands, the ZPSC has successfully been able to promote the co-operative farming model. тАЬCo-operative farming did not fail in India on its own. It was deliberately failed,тАЭ said Paramjit Kaur. Another important aspect highlighted by the study is the extent of indebtedness in such households. With higher consumption expenditure than their income, 96.3% of Dalit woman labour households are in debt in rural areas of Punjab. тАЬFurther, the Dalit woman labour households, on an average, take 80.40 per cent of their total debt from the non-institutional sources mainly from the large farmers and landlords. It has been observed that the Dalit woman labour households find it easy to incur debt from non-institutional sources and they hesitate to incur debt from institutional sources,тАЭ the study says. This is primarily because being illiterate they do not understand the formalities and procedures to be followed for availing loans from institutional sources. The indifferent attitude of the officials disappoints them, and under the prevailing feudal system large farmers and landlords easily provide loans with the sole aim of exploiting them. Their main interest lies in ensuring a supply of labour during the peak season when the demand for labour is quite high. A positive aspect of this grave problem is that 76.3% of the total debt incurred by such households is for productive purposes.

Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the murder of 24-year-old Dalit boy Pranay in Miryalguda, was found dead inside a room at Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Hyderabad.  The police who found him dead in the room suspect suicide. However, they are not concluding anything yet and probing the reason for his arrival to Hyderabad. The body was sent to Osmania Hospital in Hyderabad for post mortem. It may be recalled that Maruthi Rao, the deceased had paid Rs 1 crore to contract killers to get rid of Pranay, who hailed from Dalit community. Maruthi Rao was against his daughter Amrutha marrying Pranay. Pranay was killed just outside the hospital where the couple had gone to get a check-up done on Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time.  The police had named eight people in the chargesheet including Maruthi Rao. Media men were quick to rush to Amrutha to get her reaction on her father's death. A calm and composed Amrutha told the press that she had cut off all communication with her father since the murder of her husband. She also said that the she learnt about her father's demise only through the media and was waiting for confirmation from her relatives before she could offer any more comments.

"177",1671,"https://www.newsclick.in/gujarat-sit-says-no-rape-no-murder-modasa-dalit-rape-case","Gujarat: SIT Says No Rape, No Murder in Modasa Dalit Rape Case | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of CID (crime) that was constituted to investigate the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl who was found hanging from a tree at Modasa in GujaratтАЩs Aravalli district on January 5, concluded that she was neither raped nor murdered. The SIT report, though incomplete, said that the victim was romantically involved with prime accused Bimal Bharwad. It said that she had hung herself from a tree at Sayra village in Modasa in the intervening night of January 4 and 5 after Bharwad refused to commit to a stable relationship. In a press conference held in Ahmedabad and addressed by DIG Gautam Parmar and SP Virendra Singh, the SIT gave a sequence of events from December 30. They said that the victim, her elder sister, prime accused Bimal Bharwad and three other accused went to Asian Green Hotel and stayed the night. Gautam Parmar who is leading the SIT said, тАЬThe victim and her sister came in touch with accused Bimal Bharwad on December 14 or December 15 last year and met him for the first time on December 17.тАЭ According to their investigation, Bharwad and the victim had engaged in a physical relationship in the next few days and met at the victimтАЩs house and at various guest houses. Parmar said that the victim wanted Bharwad to commit to a stable relationship but Bharwad, being already married, came under pressure to maintain his distance. He then supposedly planned to get her involved with his cousin Akash so that he could blame her of infidelity and end the relationship. тАЬHowever, this did not work and the girl (victim) threatened to expose him,тАЭ Parmar added. тАЬOn January 1, the victim called Bharwad and asked to meet her. Bharwad revealed this to the victimтАЩs sister who advised him against meeting her. Nonetheless, Bharwad decided to meet the victim as she had threatened to expose him lest they met. So Bharwad reached her village, picked her up and drove to Modasa town where they fought for two hours. When the victim refused to get down from BharwadтАЩs car, he called her sister. However, the victim did not relent even after her sister arrived so her sister snatched her phone and smashed it so that she couldnтАЩt try to reach BharwadтАЩs wife. Following which victim got down from the car to check her phone and taking the opportunity, Bharwad fled,тАЭ added Parmar. Aggrieved, the victim took an autorickshaw and reached Sayra, her village, as per the SIT report. The SIT further added that during the investigation, the post mortem report, the FSL report (Forensic Science Laboratory), call details (40 calls from the victim to Bharwad and 67 messages asking him to marry her), statements of seven witnesses under CrPC 164 are among evidences collated and that are to be admitted in court. Reconstruction of Crime Scene as claimed by SIT The SIT has claimed that a reconstruction of the crime scene successfully concluded that it was a case of suicide and not murder. Backing up the claim, DIG Parmar said, тАЬIt is very easy to climb a tree which was demonstrated and hence reconstructed as the crime scene by a female constable.тАЭ тАЬSecondly, other than injuries on the neck caused by the dupatta used for hanging, no other injury was found on victimтАЩs body. The injuries found on victimтАЩs body in the post mortem are said to have caused by bark and branches of the tree. No semen or saliva was found on victimтАЩs body to prove rape, gang rape or unnatural sex (sodomy). Moreover, call records show that the victim had called Bimal Bharwad herself so kidnapping has been ruled out,тАЭ added Parmar. On being asked about post mortem finding of fluids from vagina and rectal prolapse, Parmar said that had occurred due to decomposition of the body. Hole in the SIT report The SIT has admitted that the police is still trying to find out what transpired between January 1, when the victim boarded an autorickshaw to reach Sayra, as claimed by SIT, and January 5, when her body was found hanging by a tree in the outskirts of the village. According to the SIT report, the victimтАЩs movement on January 1 has been traced from her village Sayra to Modasa and back to Sayra in an autorickshaw on the same day. However, the trace went cold after January 1 after which she went missing, as claimed by the family in the FIR. The family had also accused Police Inspector N.K. Rabari of refusing to register a missing person complaint and file a case of illegal detention of the victim on January 2, a day after she went missing. Noticeably, even as SIT probing the case has termed it a suicide, a parallel investigation is being conducted on Rabari for the alleged negligence. Rabari was suspended by the DGP, Gujarat, after allegations surfaced against him and the ADGP of SC/ST cell had initiated an inquiry against him. The SIT report also doesnтАЩt explain why the victim took four days to commit suicide or the reason for the injuries indicated as ante-mortem in the post mortem report. The post mortem report states, тАЬOne ligature mark is in form of dark reddish brown like abrasion on front, right and back of neck. One ligature mark on the thyroid cartilage, one reddish brown irregular shape abrasion found on upper part of left chest and abrasion marks on shoulder and thumb are all ante-mortem in nature.тАЭ The Accused Prime accused Bimal Bharwad has been booked under various sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and under IPC Section 306 for abetment to suicide, Section 201 for destruction of evidence and under Section 504 for insulting the victim with obscenity over phone calls. There was no role found of the other three accused Satish, Jigar Parmar and Dharshan Bharwad. Bharwad is to undergo a Narco test as per courtтАЩs order.","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3
"178",1672,"https://netri.co/blog/dalit-women-indian-politics-cynthia-conversationseries/","Dalit Women's Tryst with Indian Political System: In conversation with Cynthia Stephen - NETRI","A conversation with Cynthia Stephen as a part of a series of interactions with eminent personalities in our effort to enhance the understanding of the current situation pertaining to women in Indian politics. This interview is an ode to Savitri Bai Phule, first Indian feminist, an educator and leader in her own right. Cynthia has worked tirelessly and continues to voice her concerns and fight for the cause of women and especially Dalit women. She is a researcher, who had also undertaken fieldwork for her doctoral thesis on Political empowerment of Dalit Women in India. She writes fiercely, is an optimist, and demands an overhaul of the systemic forces which keeps new entrants, the young, the Dalit and the women out of the power corridors. In the light of her work with the government as a Director of the Mahila Samakhya in Karnataka, and from outside as an activist/writer and an aspiring political contestant, there are many lessons in her experience. She shares generously in this conversation. We ask her our first question: Cynthia Stephen: While there are many similarities in the situation of Dalit women and bl*ck womxn, these situations are at best analogous but not exactly similar. There are far more powerful systems at work in the lives of Dalit women. The barriers placed in front of them are almost insurmountable by themselves. For a race, there is some sort of possibilities, in a certain manner of speaking, for people to be able to transcend the discrimination through an exhibit of hard work, talent and capabilities. These opportunities are not present in the case of caste, and especially not to Dalit womxn in India.Stating it squarely, this is due to Brahminical patriarchy. It has enormous implications and connotations for people in general in India and on Dalit Womxn in particular. Can you elaborate on these real life implications of Brahaminical patriarchy and lived experiences of Dalit womxn, which leads to their social, economic and political exclusion? Cynthia: Even before we address the social, economic and political exclusion of Dalit women it is important to understand a rather more fundamental issue. The position of women within the structure of Indian society is dictated by ancient texts and scriptures, of which Manu Smriti is the most prominent one. We follow Manu Smriti in our personal lives, not in an abstract sense but in a rather existential sense. It is an ancient text which lists norms that the society is expected to follow, based on the caste system of that time. However, we still follow it in current times. A real-life example of Manu Smriti being followed is seen around us. A widowed mother is still expected to stay with her son, despite having a daughter who could either be more resourceful than the son or in another case benefit from the presence of her mother in her home in raising kids or also emotionally. But the mother in most cases refuse. We have divided these gender roles based on norms that repeatedly teach us that women derive their relevance from the man in her life. A womanтАЩs life is spent in male oversight, from father in the childhood to son in the old-age. These norms that women should not have an independent status comes from Manu Smriti. It does not give equal citizenship to women. It has constructed a privileged system for males. Discretion, entitlements and rights of the upper-caste Hindu male dominate the society. The system automatically discriminates against non-dominant caste males and women of all castes. Within this pattern of societal structure and hierarchy, the entire system is geared to transferring power and resources to the male up in the brahminical social order. Subjugation comes down the ladder, entitlements and privileges are distributed up to the top of the ladder. As B.R. Ambedkar put, тАЭ Caste system is not the Division of labour, it is a division of labourersтАЭ. The system only gives a certain kind of responsibility, validity, legitimacy to the people who are at the bottom. This is the reason that we see close to negligible Dalit womxn in any kind of positions of power and decision making. It is only because of the constitutional structure and certain level of peopleтАЩs movement that brought Mayawati, a Dalit woman, to the helm of power and political rule in a state like Uttar Pradesh. Though now the socio-political situations have changed and her politics is becoming rapidly irrelevant in the present time. The system very quickly delegitimises a woman in public life. These aspects of patriarchy are the barriers behind Dalit womenтАЩs exclusion at all levels. Cynthia: To understand the social factors at play in the lives of Black women, it is important to understand the role of mothers and women in the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. During that period, the black women were very active in their churches as community leaders and had a big role in mobilizing, motivating and supporting each other in the struggle. Rosa Parks, famously known as the тАЬmother of the freedom movementтАЭ and тАЬthe first lady of civil rightsтАЭ sparked the beginning of the first direct campaign in the post-war civil rights movement. She refused to give up her seat to a white man in the bus, was chosen to see through a court challenge following her arrest related to the matter, and this inspired people to boycott Montgomery buses for over a year. This was not an act of spontaneity in my understanding. She was already a part of large community-based leaders who were organising and resisting and working to build each other up. In contrast to the Dalit women, there is a lack of support to womenтАЩs internal social organisation. Ironically, the most active and strongest women networks in India are that of Dalit women, they still do not receive the extent of recognition received by the black womenтАЩs movement in the west. As a result of the lack of support structure for Dalit womenтАЩs mobilisation, these mobilisations are de-legitimised in Indian society and not given the value it deserves. Cynthia: Women are getting increasingly active in the political sphere. A large number of independent women are getting into the fray right from panchayat to parliament. I believe, this is the way ahead. Women want to get involved in politics. For instance, every political party has a large-base and active women wing. But the same parties are not inclined towards giving a proportionate number of tickets to women, or even put women in powerful positions within the party, with the exception of the women wing itself or the women who come from political partyтАЩs first family. An organisation which I was a part of, Mahila Samakhya in Karnatak, federated women from the grassroots up to the taluk level. Lakhs of women became a part of this network, who are still involved in their communities and work as leaders on different public issues. Some of them are also willing to enter grassroots politics. Howerver beyond district/taluk level there is a glass ceiling which women are unable to break. It is not in womenтАЩs hand- they are active, mobilised, but there is a point beyond which is it hard for them to break the ceiling. This cap is held by the resources, funds, power, decision making consolidated in the hands of the patriarchs, who are at the assembly and parliament level. The system as it exists hasnтАЩt been fair in giving due representation to vulnerable of all categories тАУ indigenous, queer, tribal, dalit, women, young people etc. We need a complete revamp and overhaul of the system. Cynthia: The funds are devolved only upto the MLA level. The MLA becomes the most powerful person ( an arbitrator) and power is centralised. There is a constitutional mandate and an intent to distribute power to people. But the system is giving a backlash by providing a framework but simultaneously hollowing it out by drawing out all the resources and placing it in the hands of the elected males, and this is where money power seeps into politics. Cynthia: Traditionally, the property has always been owned by the male of the family. This is one of the major characteristics of patriarchy. Property goes from the father to the son. In the current times, some women who work on the farms of their husbands, only give their labour, and the system extracts her labour and surplus. Women are working, but men control the resources and make all the decisions. Hence, they command the reins in any industry where women are employed. From textile to agriculture. Women rarely climb to the powerful positions within the larger economic framework. The SHG network was different and truly empowered women in the beginning but then cracks began to show. Women started borrowing for family and ended up with the burden of loans. There is systemic subjugation, exploitation and extraction of women at every level. Their vote, labour, income, employment, womb, everything becomes the subject of exploitation. Cynthia: Reservation is not a disability. It is a safeguard for constitutional entitlement. The constitutional intention is to ensure equality, participation and representation. It was a strategy to ensure equitable representation in democratic institutions where the vulnerable were excluded. At least at the grassroots major part of the goal got achieved. In my opinion, it worked marvellously and wonderfully well, at least definitely in Karnataka. We have seen a lot of positive change. Initially, local power blocs, usually comprising of dominant caste males who desired to retain their position, tried to ensure that the wife of one of their Dalit supporters is put in the seat so that they can control her through the husband. Gradually, their establishment was challenged as reservation continued and women started coming to the forefront. Subsequently, women were trained by NGOs and government before and after the elections. An organisation like Mahila Samakhya, of which I was a part, were at the forefront of providing citizenship education and training to women from all categories, who continue to be active in their communities. Female human resources with governance experience are available at the grassroots. Some of these women who came on a reserved seat first time, later challenged a non-Dalit, man in the consecutive elections when the seat got un-reserved according to the rotation system. Cynthia: Privilege that dynasty brings to the family member of an existing politician is immense. And people naturalise and normalise it by citing examples that father who is a doctor, engineers will want his children to follow the same profession. It is completely intolerable and non-sensical to compare apples with the oranges. These fields are professional fields of endeavour. One to undergo lots of education, examinations, cut-off eligibility criteria and intensive course of training to follow in the footsteps of their parents. In politics, no such requirements are to be fulfilled. It is a feudal, regressive mindset which tries to justify their position through these theories which normalise dynasty. Patriarchy propagates hierarchy, lineage and transferring privilege to next-generation (usually males). As an activist, woman and a democrat, I do not condone such normalisation.As we see, traditionally, Dalits were not in a position of power, Dalit women barely have the advantage of dynastic inheritance. The issue is not with women. They are motivated enough. We have been concentrating our resources in equipping women, but I believe what we need to rather focus on building pressure groups which will push the government to bring reforms that will change the face of power and politics in India. There is a need to address the people in Election Commission, Supreme Court, within Political parties and all the constitutional authorities in a systemic manner.India may be numerically the largest democracy, but it is the most skewed and gender unbalanced and biased democracy in the world. This is a disgrace to us as a country. First is the issue of the dynasty, but second is more structural. In the first past the post system, candidates end up winning by thinnest margins. By a swing of a few hundred, the vote of the majority of the people in a constituency is rendered waste. In this system, who is the winner really? Who is the leader? The losers are the voters, certainly. We need to take a re-look at this system. Electoral funding is another major issue that needs to be challenged in the current times with increasing opacity. Organisations like NETRI must keep mobilising and training and supporting women but it has to be a two-pronged approach. We must build pressure from the outside too. Cynthia: Mainstream political parties do not want to encourage real people to contest. Though I am not unknown in Bangalore, none of the national parties was even giving time to listen to my application or hear out why I thought I was a worthy candidate? Parties had other considerations too. Instead of choosing to be an independent candidate, based on some suggestions, I decided to join a new party, and they offered me a ticket. But as it was not a national party ( also very new), I was asked to bring 10 proposers for my candidacy. National party candidates are required to get only 2 proposers. I see it as the establishmentтАЩs attempts to keep out the new challengers. But as I persisted, I would admit it was my inexperience and lack of resources required for filing a nomination for contesting at MP level. And the fact that I did not study the document process myself, that led to some mishap. At the last hour, the lawyers who I had relied upon for my filing backed out. On the day of the nomination I submitted my documents, I was given a few hours, which is a standard practice provided to catch up with any missing papers, as I was to submit my bank statement. I got back to them, not with 10 but 11 proposers, whose details and papers were also complete up to the mark and were to be submitted in a desired number of copies. At the last moment, the Election commission said, тАЬit should have been done yesterday, we cannot take it todayтАЭ. This is deliberate exclusion of the already excluded. These practices oppress the oppressed, keep them out of the system. It was injustice on the part of the election commission. A few other independent candidates filed an appeal against the EC in the court, I missed the opportunity of being a part of that delegation by a few hours. Although, it was a huge learning experience. And I hope all these experiences I shared add some constructive value to NETRIтАЩs future work.

The founders of the party say that it seeks to represent dalits, Muslims and the extremely backward castes as also progressive elements in the society who need and deserve an independent voice. тАЬA social coalition has to be formed to politically empower the marginalised sections of the society, like the Muslims and the dalits,тАЭ said Hoda, who is a former member of the Bihar State Planning Board and was also Director at The World Bank. The party is being promoted as a political initiative based on constitutional and fundamental rights of the people, and will focus on four main areasтАФeducation, security (policing), health and land management. Hoda said the formation of the new party was necessitated since the existing parties in Bihar have failed to provide the basic services to the people and are not in sync with their aspirations, having only treated them as vote banks. тАЬThe BJP's Hindutva agenda does not satisfy the basic aspirations of the people. The JD(U), which at one time was seen as an option by the marginalised sections, has lost its credibility by its association with the BJP and its double-pronged approach to CAA and NPR-NRC. On the other hand, the Congress is far placed from the realities on the ground. And the RJD is not the RJD of the old, with Lalu Yadav in jail, the leadership confusion in the party and the Yadavs emerging as the new empowered landlords,тАЭ said Hoda. He said the party will contest the coming Assembly elections and will field around 50-60 candidates. The party, whose sphere of activity has been the West Champaran area to begin with, is now branching out into other areas such as East Champaran, Seohar, Sitamarhi, Gopalganj, Siwan and Chapra. тАЬWe have got a very positive response from the people as we have moved around in three to four districts to gauge the mood of the people. We have an organisation up and running in West Champaran, where we have block presidents and we have had a membership drive at the Panchayat level. Also, the anti-CAA and anti-NPR movement has led to people looking at us as an option,тАЭ Hoda said. Purnamasi Ram, who is a five-time MLA from Bagaha, West Champaran, and has also represented Gopalganj in the Lok Sabha, is a recognised dalit leader. He has brought a big chunk of his supporters to the new party. тАЬWe are not a party formed just for the 2020 elections.

The girl had tried to end her life but was rescued by her family. She succumbed to her injuries later. With the first of three phases of the Bihar Assembly Elections only 25 days away, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has instructed top police officials to tackle the incident to ensure that it did not become another Hathras. The state government fears protests by opposition parties and civil society, as has happened in neigbouring Uttar Pradesh. However, the state government has managed to keep the news out of the local media with information about the incident missing in print and TV coverage. A 14-year-old girl from a village in Konch, a community development block in Gaya district, was abducted by four youths when she was returning from a birthday party at a friendтАЩs house on September 29. They gang-raped her for hours. The victim was found in a semi-conscious state near the village the next morning by family members who brought her home. According to them, they looked for her late into the night after she failed to return home. When they asked her why she had not returned, she narrated the incident to them. тАЬShe was shaken and deeply pained while sharing the incident with us. She was also crying,тАЭ a member of her family said. Soon, she locked herself inside a room. The family initially thought she would open the door after a while. тАЬWhen an hour passed and she hadnтАЩt opened the door despite our repeated knocks, we sensed something was wrong, broke the door and found her hanging. Fortunately, she was alive and breathing. We immediately took her to a nearby private doctor who referred us to a hospital in Gaya. After her condition deteriorated, the hospital in Gaya advised us to shift her to a private hospital in Patna, where she died on October 1,тАЭ another family member said. According to the police, an autopsy was conducted at Gaya Medical College and its results are awaited. Afraid of being chastised in the village, her family did not approach the local police and decided not to lodge a complaint on September 30. Later, when she died and her body was cremated, an FIR was lodged against the four accused тАУ Chandan, Rahul, Tuntun тАУ based on a statement by the victimтАЩs mother. However, the police are denying that it was a case of rape. Sub-Divisional Police Officer Nagendar Singh told NewsClick that the allegations were untrue and that an investigation is on into the case. Konch police stationтАЩs officer in-charge, Prashant Kumar Singh, refused to talk about the case and said an investigation was ongoing. However, the assistant sub-inspector of the same police station, Saurav Kumar, told NewsClick that the accused, who are residents of the same village, were absconding after the incident. тАЬThe police will arrest them because raids are being conducted,тАЭ he said. Realising the gravity of the situation given the upcoming polls, Gaya Senior Superintendent of Police, Rajiv Mishra, visited the village on Friday, met her family and assured them of action against the accused and justice. Over the past 48 hours, three rape cases were reported in Bihar. A 12-year-old physically challenged girl was raped by a married man in a village Gaya. Later, the accused was caught by the villagers, who beat him up and handed them over to the police. On Thursday, a minor girl was gang-raped under Chainpur police station in Kaimur district. The three accused tried to kill her but she managed to survive. Local police have arrested two of the three named accused in the case. With Bihar CM Nitish Kumar hardly missing an opportunity to overstate the law-and-order situation in the state, the opposition is likely to raise it during campaigning.","IND","dalit",1,3,1,3

The former MLA, however, blamed the Shiv Sena for the complaint against him. The complainant, Nitin Ratan Dabhade (30), told the police that he had set up a temporary paan (betel) booth in Krantinagar area of the city. Jadhav came there on Saturday and asked him to remove the booth. He also allegedly used rude words against Dabhade's religion and threatened to kill him, the official said quoting the complaint. A case has been registered by the Kranti Chowk police against Jadhav under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, he said. Jadhav, who earlier represented Kannad Assembly seat in Aurangabad district, resigned from the Shiv Sena in 2018 after being miffed with the party leadership over the issue of reservations for the Marathas, Dhangars and Muslims. He contested the last year's state Assembly polls as an Independent and lost to Uday Singh Rajput of the Shiv Sena. When contacted, Jadhav, who recently joined the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), alleged that the Shiv Sena was behind the complaint against him. ""The Shiv Sena is behind this complaint. I demanded removal of the booth and the police acted on it. The matter was over there. But, I later got to know that some Shiv Sena workers accompanied the complainant to the police station,"" he said.

Today when the Parliament session started at 3pm, I was moving towards the Well of the House to raise the issue of Delhi violence. That time the BJP MP hit me on my shoulder. Parliament is not secure for women Parliament members.тАЭ However, Meena, claiming that the allegations were false, said, тАЬAs she opened the banner in Lok Sabha, it hit me on my head. I asked her to move ahead. I didn't hit or push her. If she says she is using 'Dalit' word, then I'm also a Dalit woman.тАЭ Soon after the session in the Lok Sabha commenced at 2 pm on Monday, Opposition members started raising slogans from the Well against the government. The Lower House was adjourned three times till 4.30 pm as the ruckus continued. The Opposition members went into the section of the treasury benches carrying a black banner, and demanded Shah's resignation, as the Speaker took up the listed business. Parliamentary Affairs minister Pralhad Joshi condemned their ""unruly behaviour"" and asked the Speaker to continue with normal business. Joshi alleged that ""these are the people"" who have provoked the riots. ""They murdered 3,000 people in 1984 (riots) and did no investigation. The priority is to restore peace... but they want to create tension,"" he said. Seeking to restore normalcy in the House, Birla asked Opposition members who were in the Well to take their seats even as they continued to shout the slogan тАШWe want justiceтАЩ. They were also holding placards saying ""Stop hate speech, save our India"". Things took a turn for worse as Congress' Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu took a black banner to the Treasury benches where BJP's Sanjay Jaiswal was speaking on 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill. BJP members, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey, asked them to return to the Well. The charge by the Congress members angered BJP members, including many from back benches, who rushed towards the Congress members. Members from both sides then began pushing and shoving each other following which the proceedings were adjourned till 3 pm by the Speaker. Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani were seen trying to pacify the agitated members. Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi were present in the House during the uproar. When the House reassembled at 3 pm, some BJP members were seen blocking the way to their side of the Well. BJP's Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House again till 4 pm saying ""whatever you have done is wrong"". But the ruckus continued when the House again met and it was adjourned till 4.30 pm by the Chair. However, the slogan-shouting by the BJP members continued. They chanted slogans like ""Desh ki raksha kaun karega, hum karenge hum karenge (Who will defend the nation, we will do it"" and ""Mahatma Gandhi amar rahein, nakli Gandhi jail mein rahein (Long live Mahatama Gandhi, fake Gandhis stay in jail). Some Opposition members placed a placard demanding Shah's resignation on the Speaker's table but it was swiftly removed by the staff. Earlier, Birla asked leaders of Opposition parties to ensure that their members take their respective seats as the ""people of the country are watching (the proceedings)"". ""This is the temple of democracy. There are certain rules and tradition. You should not come to the Well,"" he said. Birla also said ""as you are responsible representatives of people here, it is your collective responsibility to maintain peace and tranquility."" Amid the din, two bills тАФ The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill and Mineral Laws Amendment Bill тАФ were introduced. Also the Direct Tax Vivaad Se Vishwas Bill was moved for consideration and passing.

(PTI) New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused the government of not allowing a debate in Parliament on the issue of communal violence in Delhi, while also alleging that one of its Dalit MPs was assaulted by a BJP lawmaker. The opposition party said it will continue to protest in Parliament over the communal violence in Delhi as it is its duty to uncover the ""conspiracy"" behind the riots. BJP and Congress members pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha on Monday as opposition parties vehemently protested over the issue of violence in Delhi and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. Speaking to reporters after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress' leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party demanded that the violence in Delhi be discussed in the Lower House of Parliament as it was a very important issue and the world was talking about it. The party demanded that there should be a debate on the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah participating as all Indians want it to happen, Chowdhury said. ""The government should put forward its views on it. We were trying to make this request, but the government did not allow us to do so and kept making one excuse after another,"" he said. ""What is surprising is that when Delhi was burning, the ruling party thought that 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill should be brought. Without asking us, they started discussing the bill,"" the Congress leader said. Chowdhury said ""democracy was torn to shreds"" as the Opposition party was not allowed to air its views. ""The sad part is that a Dalit MP of our party from Kerala was assaulted by ruling party MP. She also started crying and said 'if this happens inside the House to Dalits what will happen outside',"" he said. ""Our protest will continue. It is our duty to uncover who makes hate speeches, who indulge in killings and what is the conspiracy behind the violence,"" Chowdhury said. Congress MP Ramya Haridas on Monday lodged a complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she was assaulted by BJP MP Jaskaur Meena inside the Lower House of Parliament and sought immediate action over the matter. Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that for three days riots continued unabated, but Union ministers did not make any statement and did not visit the riot-affected areas. ""Because of that police also did not act,"" he said. ""The central government wanted that those who are dying, let them die and those who are being burnt alive, let it happen. Hate speeches were given by leaders of the ruling party which meant that the central government was behind the riots,"" he alleged. All business in Parliament should be adjourned to discuss the issue of Delhi violence, Azad said.","IND","dalit",1,3,1,3

The alleged incident happened last week. The Aroor police have registered a case against Gopi of Ezhupunna under Sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police said the Kerala High Court prevented GopiтАЩs arrest after he moved an anticipatory bail application on Thursday. As per a complaint filed by the parents of the victim, the boy, along with his friend, had gone to bathe in the pond of the Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu temple, Ezhupunna, following a disruption in the water supply on March 6. The victim was blocked from entering the pond by Gopi stating that people of the Dalit community should not take bath in the temple pond. He then released air from the tyre of the victimтАЩs bicycle. The boy questioned this and the accused beat him on his neck and punched him on the stomach. тАЬAfter getting information, I reached the spot and saw Gopi brutally assaulting my son and immediately took him to the Thuravoor taluk hospital. I came to know that Gopi used to scold and attack other children too. The incident has nothing to do with the temple committee,тАЭ said the father of the victim. After spending a couple of days at the hospital, the boy was discharged earlier this week to write the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination. The accused, a retired railway official, reportedly is of the Kudumbi caste. Sasi Kumar, secretary, Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu Temple Dewasom, said that the pond was opened to all irrespective of religion and caste. тАЬThe incident has nothing to do with the Devaswom. It was an issue between individuals. People from all religions use the pond. It will remain like that,тАЭ he said. Mr. Kumar added that the accused was not a member of the temple committee. The police investigation into the incident is led by Cherthala Deputy Superintendent of Police A.G. Lal.

Source: iStock.   Aurangabad, February 6 A 50-year old Dalit woman, who was set on fire by a neighbour after she resisted his move to enter her house here in Maharashtra, has died, a doctor said on Thursday. The woman, who suffered about 95 per cent burns in the incident that took place in Andhari village of Sillod tehsil on Sunday midnight, was undergoing treatment at a government medical college and hospital in Aurangabad city. ""She died around 10 pm on Wednesday,"" the hospital's medical superintendent Suresh Harbade told PTI. The accused, Santosh Mohite (50), who knew the woman as he resided in her neighbourhood in Andhari village, was arrested on Tuesday, a police official said. As per the woman's statement given to police before death, she tried to push Mohite out of her house, but in vain. This led to a quarrel between them following which Mohite set her ablaze, Sillod (rural) police station's inspector Kiran Bidve said. ""The victim and the accused knew each other, and he used to come to her house. But, on Sunday when he came around midnight, the woman opposed it saying their meeting at that hour would defame her,"" he said. However, despite her opposition, Mohite entered her house, and they had a fight, he said. ""During the quarrel, Mohite poured kerosene kept nearby on the woman and set her afire,"" he added. The accused later locked the door from outside and ran away, the police said. On hearing the woman's screams, some of her relatives staying in the vicinity rushed to the place and took her to a local hospital, from where she was referred to the government hospital in Aurangabad city. The accused was earlier booked under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass with preparation for causing hurt to any person) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), but will now also be charged under 302 (murder), Bidve said. He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the official said. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jaleel demanded that the case be tried in a fast-track court for ensuring justice to the victim and her family. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader said he has demanded in Parliament that hearing be conducted in fast-track court in this case and that of a woman set on fire in Wardha district. A 25-year-old lecturer was set ablaze by a stalker in Wardha on Monday, leaving her critically injured. тАФ PTI Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

The police in Palwal district of Haryana have arrested three people for allegedly attacking a Dalit family for not switching off the lights at 9 pm on April 5, as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, The Indian Express reported on Wednesday. The accused, belonging to the Gujjar community, allegedly barged into the house of a Dalit family in Pingore village around 9.30 pm on April 5 and attacked eight people. Dhanpal, the complainant, alleged that the accused used casteist slurs and told them to keep their house lights switched off for the whole night. Besides Dhanpal, his son and daughter and five other family members sustained injuries. The accused were armed with sticks, iron rods and bricks, Dhanpal alleged. They also indulged in vandalism, he said. Dhanpal, contradicting the attackers, said he had switched off the lights of his home for nine minutes on April 5. Sadar Station House Officer Jitendra Kumar said that the children of the two families sparred over switching off the lights. Following this, the families began to throw stones at each other, he claimed. They also damaged a vehicle. A case has been registered on charges of causing hurt and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code. The provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been invoked, The Tribune reported. Modi had suggested that citizens light candles and switch on mobile flashlights for nine minutes on April 5 to mark the fight against the disease. The coronavirus has so far infected 5,734 people in India, and has killed 166, according to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.","IND","dalit",0,0,1,3

On Monday, the day before writer and activist Anand Telbumbde is due to surrender to prison authorities for allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to foment violence between Dalits and Marathas on January 1, 2018, and to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he wrote an open letter to the people of India detailing how the authorities manufactured prejudice against him and others in the case. тАЬI have an unblemished record of service for nearly five decades to this country in various roles in corporate world, as a teacher, as a civil rights activist and a public intellectual...,тАЭ Teltumbde wrote. тАЬBut at the fag end of my life, I am being charged for the heinous crime under the draconian UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]. An individual like me obviously cannot counter the spirited propaganda of the government and its subservient media.тАЭ Nine other activists and lawyers have been in jail since 2018 and face trial for allegedly participating in the conspiracy. On April 8, the Supreme Court had given a weekтАЩs time to Teltumbde and rights activist Gautam Navlakha to surrender to prison authorities. They have been charged under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code following violence between Dalits and Marathas in the village of Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. The clashes came a day after an event in Pune, called the Elgar Parishad, had been organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 in which the Dalit soldiers fighting for the British Army had helped to defeat the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. One person died in violence during a bandh called by Dalit outfits on January 2. The Pune Police alleged that Teltumbde and Navlakha were among a group of people with Maoist links that had conspired to organise the violence and have also alleged that they plotted to kill Modi. The inquiry was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. Here is the full text of TeltumbeтАЩs letter. I am aware this may be completely drowned in the motivated cacophony of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh combine and the subservient media but I still think it may be worth talking to you as I do not know whether I would get another opportunity. Since August 2018, when the police raided my house in faculty housing complex of Goa Institute of Management, my world turned completely topsy-turvy. Never in my worst dream, could I imagine the things that began happening to me. Although, I was aware that police used to visit the organisers of my lectures, mostly universities, and scare them with enquiries about me, I thought they might be mistaking me for my brother who left family years back. While I was teaching at IIT Kharagpur, an officer of BSNL phoned, introducing himself as my admirer and well-wisher, informed me that my phone was being tapped. I thanked him but did nothing, not even to change my SIM. I was disturbed by these intrusions but comforted myself that it might rather convince the police that I was a normal person and there is no element of illegality in my conduct. The police generally dislike civil rights activists because they question the police. I imagined, it might be due to the fact that I belonged to that tribe. But again I comforted myself that they would find that I could not perform that role either because of my full-time engagement with my job. But when I got an early morning phone call from the director of my institute, informing me that the police had raided the campus and were looking for me, I was wordless for a few seconds. I had come to Mumbai on official work just a few hours before and my wife had come earlier. When I learnt of the arrests, of the persons whose houses were raided that day, I was shaken by the realisation that I escaped that fate just by whiskers. The police did know my whereabouts and could arrest me even then but for the reasons known only to them, did not do so. They did open our house too, forcibly getting a duplicate key from the security guard, but just video-graphed it and locked it back. Our ordeal began right there. At the advice of our lawyers, my wife took the next available flight to Goa, and lodged a complaint with Bicholim Police Station that the police had opened our house in our absence and that we would not be responsible if they had planted anything. She volunteered giving our telephone numbers should the police want to inquire with us. Strangely,the police had started holding press conferences soon after they embarked on the Maoist story. It was clearly meant to whip up prejudice in public against me and other arrested with the help of obliging media. On August 31, 2018, in one such press conference, a police officer read out a letter purportedly recovered from the computer of previous arrestees as an evidence against me. The letter was clumsily constructed with the information on the academic conference I had attended which was easily available on the website of American University of Paris. Initially I laughed it out but next, decided to file a civil and criminal defamation suit against this officer and sent a letter on September 5, 2018 to the government of Maharashtra for sanction as per the procedure. There has been no response from the government to date. The press conferences of the police, however, were stopped when High Court reprimanded them. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh hand in the entire case was not hidden. My friends told me that one of their functionaries, Ramesh Patange, had written an article in their mouthpiece Panchjanya targeting me in April 2015. I was identified as тАЬMayavi AmbedkarwadiтАЭ along with Arundhati Roy and Gail Omvedt. Mayavi in the Hindu mythology refers to a demon meant to be destroyed. When I was illegally arrested by Pune Police while still under protection of the Supreme Court, a cyber-gang of Hindutva vandalised my Wikimedia page. This page is a public page and for years I was not even aware of it. They firstly deleted all information and only wrote, тАЬHe has a Maoist brotherтАж his house was raided тАж he was arrested for links with MaoistтАЭ, etc. Some students later told me that whenever they tried restoring the page, or editing the page, this gang would pounce upon and delete everything and put up derogatory content. Ultimately, Wikimedia intervened and the page stabilised with some of their negative content. There was a media blitzkrieg, reeling off all kinds of canards through the RSSтАЩs so-called Naxal experts. My complaints against the channels and even to the India Broadcasting Foundation did not receive a response. Then in October 2019, the Pegasus story came out that the government had inserted a very pernicious Israeli spyware on my phone, among those of several others. There was a momentary uproar in media but this serious matter also has died. I have been a simple person who has been earning his bread honestly and helping people to the extent possible with my knowledge through writings. I have an unblemished record of service for nearly five decades to this country in various roles in corporate world, as a teacher, as a civil rights activist and a public intellectual. In my voluminous writings comprising over 30 books, and numerous papers/articles/comments/columns/interviews, published internationally, not an insinuation of support to violence or any subversive movement could be found. But at the fag end of my life, I am being charged for the heinous crime under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. An individual like me obviously cannot counter the spirited propaganda of the government and its subservient media. The details of the case are strewn across the internet and are enough for any person to see that it is a clumsy and criminal fabrication. A summary note on All India Forum for the Right to Education website may be read. For your benefit, I will provide its gist here: I am implicated on the basis of the five letters among the 13 that the police purportedly recovered from the computers of two arrestees in the case. Nothing has been recovered from me. The letter make reference to тАЬAnandтАЭ, a common name in India, but the police unquestioningly identified it with me. Notwithstanding the form and content of these letters, which was trashed by experts and even by a justice in Supreme Court, who was the only one in the entire judiciary who went into the nature of the evidence. the content does not refer to anything that could be remotely construed as even a simple crime. But taking shelter under the draconian provisions of the UAPA Act, which renders a person defenceless, I am being jailed. The case may be depicted for your understanding as follows: suddenly, a police posse descends down on your residence and ransacks your house without showing any warrant. At the end, they arrest you and lodge in the police lockup. In the court, they would say that while investigating a theft (or any other complaint) case in xxx place (substitute any place in India) police recovered a pen drive or a computer from yyy (substitute any name) in which some letters written by a supposed member of some banned organisation were recovered that had a mention of zzz who according to the police is none other than you. They present you as part of deep conspiracy. Suddenly, you find your world turned topsy-turvy. Your job gone, family losing house, media defaming you about which you cannot do a damn thing. Police will produce тАЬsealed envelopesтАЭ to convince judges that there was a prima facie case against you that needs custodial interrogation. No arguments about there being no evidence would be entertained as judges would answer that it would be seen in trial. After custodial interrogation, you will be sent to jail. You beg for bail and the courts will reject them as the historical data shows that the average period of incarceration ranged from four to 10 years before they got bail or acquitted. And this can happen literally to ANYONE. In the name of the тАЬnationтАЭ, such draconian legislations that denude innocent people of their liberties and all constitutional rights are constitutionally validated. The jingoist nation and nationalism have got weaponised by the political class to destroy dissent and polarise people. The mass frenzy has accomplished complete derationalisation and inversion of meanings where destroyers of the nation become deshbhakts and selfless servers of people become deshdrohis. As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim moment. Well, I am off to National Investigative Agency custody and do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes.

"210",2020,"https://www.groundxero.in/2020/04/03/coronovirus-lockdown-another-migrant-dalit-labour-commits-suicide/","Coronovirus Lockdown : Another Migrant Dalit Labour Commits Suicide","Roshan Lal, a 22-year-old migrant worker, committed suicide on Wednesday after he was allegedly humiliated and beaten up by the UP police for breaking quarantine rules. A report by GroundXero.   тАЬHello Namaskar friends, my name is Roshan Lal. I am very upset today. My only fault is that I stepped out (of the school where he was put in quarantine) to get flour because we did not have anything at my home to eat. A policeman named Anoop Singh has thrashed me so badly that my right hand has stopped working. Perhaps, it is broken now. DonтАЩt ask how helpless I am feeling right now.тАЭ   тАЬDespite this, nobody came forward to help me that is why I am taking this extreme step.тАЭ   The testimony above has been transcribed from the three recorded audio clips which Roshan Lal, a migrant worker, forwarded to his friend and family members on WhatsApp, minutes before he took the тАЬextreme stepтАЭ of killing himself by hanging. Roshal Lal body was found hanging from a tree in the school campus, where he was quarantined.  Roshan Lal was a22 year old dalit youth,who worked as a daily wage labourer in Gurgaon. He had returned to his native village, Pipariya under Maigalganj police station, on March 29, six days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown, and was kept in a local school under quarantine by village officials. He committed suicide on Wednesday, after he was allegedly humiliated and brutally beaten up by the UP police for breaking quarantine rules.  In one of the audio clips, Roshan Lal can be heard saying,  тАЬMy only fault is that I came back from Gurgaon two days ago. My mistake is that I was sitting in the school when I got a call that there was no food at home. My sister-in-law asked me to get some wheat grounded. And I went. That was my mistake тАУ I should have stayed in the school. After that, a constable named Anoop came there and asked if I am Roshan. I said yes. He beat me up severely. My right hand is not working. Then he made me speak to the chowki in-charge. I asked him to help me get treated. He did not help me.тАЭ  In another audio clip, Roshan Lal can be heard saying:  тАЬFriends, if there is anyone who does not believe me, they should see my pants. There is only blood. I donтАЩt want to live now. Action should be taken against constable Anoop Kumar Singh. Because of him, I am killing myself.тАЭ  RoshanтАЩs elder brother Bankey Lal narrated how his brother managed to reach the village. Bankey Lal said, тАЬHe [Roshan Lal] had to walk from Gurgaon till AnandVihar. From there, he boarded a bus to Lucknow. From Lucknow, he hitched rides before walking for the last-mile journey.тАЭ  The family members and villagers staged a protest and refused to cremate the body until a case was lodged against the constable. Bankey Lal said, the police had refused to lodge an FIR against the constable. He added, тАЬJust because we are poor doesnтАЩt mean we can be humiliated in the village and nothing will happen to those who are responsible for doing this.тАЭ  A senior police officer in the district said Roshan refused to follow quarantine norms. тАЬHe was roaming around. That is why he was stopped and maybe, he was slapped a couple of times by the constable,тАЭ Lucknow Range Inspector General S K Bhagat said an inquiry had been ordered and action would be taken on the basis of its findings within 48 hours.  Roshan LalтАЩs story, by no means, is an isolated incident. By now, most of us have seen the photographs and videos of the migrant workers being humiliated across the country by security forces as they trek miles along the highways to reach their homes. To us they are the nameless, faceless multitude тАУ the carriers of the dreaded virus. They are the тАШvectorтАЩ.  Roshan Lal provides us with a name and a face to this narrative. His story is also one of habitual public humiliation faced by millions at the hands of the state тАУ actualized by the police тАУ and the middle-class civil society. Class exacerbates such instances of humiliation. Caste intensifies it. The two combine together to create a circuit of public humiliation, which lies beyond the imagination of those of us who are participating in тАЬsari challengesтАЭ and тАЬquarantine cookingтАЭ on social media during the days of the lockdown.  We have more or less maintained тАШsocial distancingтАЩ from the likes of Roshan Lal. This lockdown and the fear of the virus reaching us have forced us to take notice of them. We wanted them to be locked and quarantined, but in a more тАЬhumaneтАЭ way. But, the visuals of their helplessness,public humiliation and plight haveindeed disturbed our sanitized morality, as theyhave trickled down our social media feeds. Yet, such visuals did not disturb our everyday material existences in anyway. At a time, when тАЬsolidarityтАЭ and тАЬempathyтАЭ have become buzzwords in our social media posts, we did not even try to understand the ways in which such instances of public humiliation create long-standing trauma in those who have to go through them, let alone reach out to them. Because, after all, individuals like Roshan Lal are, for us, mere bodies тАФ the invisible laboring bodies which provide us with the essential goods and services. And, obviously, dispensable. That is why, other than their capacity to perform labour, their stories do not matter.  Roshan Lal took us by our throats to challenge that invisibility. He forced us to see, how behind every instance of public humiliation by the police, there is a bruised, traumatized human ego and self. Yet, what does it say about us, as a society, when in order to communicate to us that every poor dalit youth has a sense of self, he had to kill himself? In our neoliberalized world, where words such as тАЬtraumaтАЭ and тАЬPTSDтАЭ have become much over-used and abused buzzwords amongst a certain section of middle-class youth, what does Roshan LalтАЩs тАЬtraumaтАЭ mean? How we are to take into account his trauma, and those of millions like him, as a society? The truth is, in an inequality-ridden casteist, classistsociety like ours, even our notions of trauma must exist in conflict with each other. The truth is, there is no universal understanding of trauma anywhere beyond the inequalities engendered by class, caste, race and gender.  In a couple of days, as we, the obedient citizens, paying heed to the call of the Pied Piper will stand on our balconies, with candles in our hands to ward off the evil virus, the last words of Roshan Lal and Aldrin Lyndog тАУ the marginalized youths тАУ who were forced to take their lives during this lockdown, will come to haunt us.

Benedict Mayaki, SJ A Jesuit apostolate in the Indian State of Bihar is working in collaboration with a government agency to provide food for thousands of poor people, especially the most disadvantaged among the Dalit communities during the imposed coronavirus lockdown period in India. Manthan, a Jesuit social action center involved in working with the Dalit or тАШuntouchablesтАЩ in the Hindu caste system, provided food parcels to about 5,000 poor people in Patna, the state capital. They also distributed foodstuff to widows, the elderly and the sick. Fr. Juno Sebastian SJ, the director of Manthan, said that this initiative came about after he was contacted by many people who said that they had not eaten for days. He immediately got in contact with officials of the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) who agreed to support his idea to feed the poor. тАЬNow we are distributing cooked meals to 1,500 of them daily, and we will continue until the end of the isolation. We are also working to help 6,500 Musahar families in Patna, for a total of about 40,000 people,тАЭ Fr. Sebastian said. The distribution of food takes place in the slums and villages where the Jesuit Provincial of the Patna Province, Father Donald Miranda, SJ, said that they have managed to reach 700 other families. It has also been extended to parts of Uttar Pradesh where about 3,000 families are also able to be fed daily. The Jesuit College of St. Xavier in Patna is also involved in distributing food to about 530 families in the area. Even though the Bihar state government distributes food to the people free of charge, many Dalits do not have access to it because they have no documents to prove where they live or their identity. On 24 March, the Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown as part of precautionary measures to stem the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The lockdown has been hard on the poor and the vulnerable especially the Dalit communities, who are predominantly menial workers in the suburbs of Patna, the capital of Bihar. India presently has 18,658 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections with 592 deaths and 3,273 recovered patients.

Several Dalit leaders, including MPs and MLAs, issued a statement on Monday calling the imminent arrest of activist Anand Teltumbde in the Bhima Koregaon case a тАЬnational shameтАЭ. On April 8, the Supreme Court had given a weekтАЩs time to Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha to surrender to prison authorities. The order came after the court had rejected their anticipatory bail pleas last month. The counsel for the activists had argued that they are over 65 years old with pre-existing medical conditions, adding that they should be granted more time to surrender. тАЬGoing to jail at the time of the Covid-19 virus is virtually a death sentence,тАЭ the lawyer had said. However, the top court refused to budge. On Monday, the Dalit leaders, which included Communist Party of India General Secretary D Raja, Independent Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Congress leader and former MP Udit Raj and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief Prakash Ambedkar among others, said that Teltumbde will surrender on April 14, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar. They described the surrender of Teltumbde and Navlakha on the same day as тАЬshameful for Dalits, Adivasis, OBCs [Other Backward Castes] and minorities on many counts for all of IndiaтАЭ. The signatories accused the Centre of trying to тАЬcrush the spirit that kept the flame of democracy alive in our midstтАЭ and added that even extremely repressive regimes were releasing political prisoners in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The statement added that the arrest would be an тАЬobnoxious warning of the casteist Manuvadi regime to Dalit, Adivasi, OBC and minority intellectuals not to raise their voices of protestтАЭ. They said TeltumbdeтАЩs arrest revealed IndiaтАЩs тАЬentrenched casteismтАЭ. The Dalit leaders called on the Dalit, OBC, Adivasi and minority leadership to тАЬstand and seek justiceтАЭ for TeltumbdeтАЩs freedom of expression. They asked the public to unite in the name of Ambedkar. Violence broke out between Dalits and Marathas in the village of Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. This came a day after an event in Pune, called the Elgar Parishad, was organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 in which the Dalit soldiers fighting for the British Army defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. One person died in violence during a bandh called by Dalit outfits on January 2. Navlakha and Teltumbde were charged under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code following the violence at Bhima Koregaon village. The case made by the Pune Police alleged they had Maoist links, and the inquiry was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. Meanwhile, the petitioners in the Bhima Koregaon case wrote an open letter to Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde, alleging that even though 18 months had passed since activists Varavara Rao, Arun Fereira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha had been arrested, the prosecution had failed to produce any new facts or evidence to support its case. тАЬDespite this, not only have the accused been denied bail and deprived of their liberty, but two new names have been added to their ranks,тАЭ the petitioners said. The petitioners тАУ historian Romila Thapar, Prabhat Patnaik, Devaki Jain, Maja Daruwala and Satish Deshpande reminded the Supreme Court that it had in 2018 ruled against the plea for a Special Investigation Team probe in the case, saying the inquiry was at an early stage. тАЬLike all fair-minded citizens, we are shocked that the prosecution has not been held accountable to the spirit of the law,тАЭ the petitioners wrote. тАЬWe are anguished that our courts have condoned the continued imprisonment of those who have dared to defend the rights of voiceless and marginalised people, and are now allowing this vindictive campaign to be expanded. This is especially inhuman and incomprehensible at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is threatening our overcrowded jails.тАЭ The petitioners urged the chief justice to defend the Constitution and uphold the human rights of the accused through a тАЬpositive interventionтАЭ in the matter. Global human rights watchdog Amnesty International condemned the Supreme CourtтАЩs order directing that Teltumbde and Navlakha be arrested and imprisoned within a week, calling it тАЬcruel and disappointingтАЭ. тАЬOn one hand, the court acknowledges that overcrowded prisons present a serious threat and recommends the release of prisoners during the pandemic and then it directs two activists who have been critical of the government to surrender before the police and to be sent to jail,тАЭ Amnesty International India Executive Director Avinash Kumar said. Amnesty International said Teltumbde and Navlakha have a history of working for the poor and the marginalised sections. тАЬAmnesty India believes that the impending arrests of the two, along with the arrests of the nine activists in the Bhima Koregaon case in 2018, are politically motivated actions that are aimed at chilling peaceful dissent,тАЭ it added. Earlier this month, more than 5,000 individuals and over 15 organisations around the world had urged the Centre to delay Teltumbde and NavlakhaтАЩs arrest.","IND","dalit",1,1,1,3

If youтАЩd like to share your write ups, email us at pragya@feminisminindia.com. The period of 1920s till late 1940s saw the upsurge in nationalist movement. The period also saw a rise in anti-caste movements within the nationalist movement. The 1920s were radically transformative decade for the Dalit mass movements in India. Dalit grievances were transforming into an effective political and organisational structure thus shaping Dalit mass politics during the period. The rise of Dalit journalism is seen since 1920s as mainstream media refused to speak about the struggles of the oppressed. With Mahad agitation of 1927 a series of assertive and affirmative mass politics unfolded. The agitation was a visible example of how Dalits had been deprived from public spaces and perpetually subjected to the upper caste violence. The aftermath of Mahad agitation gave the demand of Dalits to be identified separately from the Hindus because there was almost no social cohesion between them and the dominant Brahminical ideology. The question of violence became central in the public sphere as well as the need to have a тАШmouthpieceтАЩ to mobilise public opinions, and leaders like Dr. Ambedkar believed on newspapers to bring about a change in the lives of the oppressed classes. The rise of Dalit journalism is also seen since 1920s as mainstream media refused to speak about the struggles of the oppressed. With Mahad agitation of 1927 a series of assertive and affirmative mass politics unfolded. The agitation was a visible example of how Dalits had been deprived from public spaces and perpetually subjected to the upper caste violence. The leaders knew that mainstream mass media would reflect traditional caste ideology, and hence, there was a need to have a separate media altogether. Thus, the very first newspaper catering to the oppressed classes was тАШMooknayakтАШ, on January 31, 1920. It ran for three years and in 1927, and then тАШBahishkrut BharatтАШ was founded. During the 1920s, Mooknayak and Bahishkrut Bharat took bold positions on several contentious issues pertaining to religion, society and politics. As Bahishkrut Bharat was established as a product of powerful mass agitation during the Mahad Satyagraha in 1927, it later became the mouthpiece of the Ambedkar-led Bahishkrut Hitkarni Sabha. The name of newspapers posed a satire on the prevailing structure of society like the тАШMooknayakтАШ which literally meant тАШleader of the voicelessтАЩ and Bahishkrut Bharat meaning тАШExcluded IndiaтАЩ. The title of Bahishkrut Bharat was proposed during a meeting held at Bombay being presided by Dr. Ambedkar. The newspapers were a collective effort of propagating information and form a mouth piece. It received funding from Dalit activists of Konkan and Bombay who weтАЩre participating in the Mahad agitations. Meanwhile, Dr. Ambedkar was involved in writing the reports, commentaries and editorials. These newspapers thus were very important in mobilising the opinion against caste violence in the late 1920s. The important editorials written by Dr. Ambedkar were read publicly in Dalit gatherings and helped in mobilising of Dalits in Western India. In Bahishkrut Bharat, emphasis was laid on the incapability of Hindu society to realise basic social norms and absence of social affinity within caste structure. Various editorials, news reports and testimonies were published on violence against Dalits in western India. Different problems of society and divisions of caste were often criticised in the writings of the papers. They also strongly questioned the Congress and right-wing Hindu nationalists for their indifference and ignorance to the question of caste. Also read: Why Dalit WomenтАЩs Contribution Needs Assertion Today Dr. Ambedkar in one of the editorials argued that a nationalist ideology cannot withstand on the notions of ignorance towards caste. He emphasised on the absence of opportunities for individuals to intermix with another which is harmful to national unity. As a result, there are indifferences, hierarchy and violence with no scope for genuine national unity. With the onset of Dalit mass politics in late 1920s, the mainstream media and the alternative press of oppressed became opposite to each other. During the second round table conference when separate electorates and double vote for the depressed classes were announced, the Congress, the press and the mainstream media condemned Dr. Ambedkar for it. These newspapers thus were very important in mobilising the opinion against caste violence in the late 1920s. The important editorials written by Dr. Ambedkar were read publicly in Dalit gatherings and helped in mobilising of Dalits in Western India. Mainstream media had clearly defined its side on who constitutes what and shaped a huge public opinion and mass politics. For the press, the Congress symbolised nationalism and national unity and there was a clear distinction among editors about what constituted nationalism and consequently, тАШIndianтАЩ politics. Thus what was тАШanti nationalтАЩ or тАШcommunalтАЩ politics was categorised very systematically. Dalit non-violent protests were never seen as Satyagraha. The Mahad struggle and the Nasik temple entry movement were not considered as Satyagraha by the mainstream media but an attack on social fabric of the country. Thus, the newspapers presented an alternative space and ideas against the dominant hegemonic ideology. However, during the anti-caste struggle and for this alternative view the mainstream media portrayed the anti-caste leaders as тАШtraitorsтАЩ or тАШdividersтАЩ of the coherent national space. Media played a significant role in the movement and saw emergence of alternative media as a form of protest from the dominant mainstream to put the тАШsilencedтАЩ or тАШunheardтАЩ narrative. Study of media of today reveals the same distribution of power within media industry as of those times and the biased or ignored coverage or reports of caste violence. Even after almost 100 years after the first Dalit newspaper was published to this day newsrooms of the mainstream media are dominated by upper caste men. The power structure of media is still the same and thus the mammoth problems are left unnoticed and uncared for by the mainstream media. Also read: The Search For Caste Solidarity: Dalit Women In India And Nepal There is immense potential in the internet to give power to the marginalised communities to have their own media to speak and discuss the issues concerning them freely and openly. Although the forms of alternative media like Veli Vada, Round Table India, Dalit Camera, etc. are changing with increasing participation from the Dalit community but the purpose to stand at par with the mainstream media and offer a counter-hegemonic representation is similar to what it was during the traditional media of newspapers. Apart from change in the medium, the content and the principles are same. Featured Image Source: Velivada Follow FII channels on Youtube and Telegram for latest updates.

The letter asks Bachelet to appeal to Indian PM Modi to dismiss the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. It says, тАЬ[I]n 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to IndiaтАЩs annual National Crime Record BureauтАЩs тАЬCrime in IndiaтАЭ 2019 report.

For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits - 26% of all cases reported.тАЭ The groups express concern over the increased attacks on women and Dalits under the тАЬHindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideologyтАЭ, and say: тАЬThree other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim's remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur, a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered - rape is suspected - and in Azamgarh, an 8-year-old girl was raped.тАЭ Read the full text of the letter below: Dear Ms Bachelet We are writing to you to express our deep sense of shock and dismay at the terrible events unfolding in Uttar Pradesh, India and to urge you to take action as outlined below. Recent events On 14th September a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and assaulted with inhuman violence in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Her spine was broken, paralysing all her limbs, her body grievously bruised and her tongue was brutally wounded. The four men who had raped and assaulted her were oppressor caste Thakurs who dominated the village she lived in - a place which continues to practice тАШuntouchabilityтАЩ. They had allegedly been ruthlessly harassing her for a considerable length of time, to the extent that she was afraid of leaving her home. But worse was to come. The UP police, initially reluctant to register a case against the four accused, left her lying on the concrete floor of the police station and when she was eventually taken to a hospital she was left in a generic ward. Only after pressure built up was she transferred to the ICU and later to DelhiтАЩs Safdarjung Hospital, where she passed away on 29th September. But even this scale of cruelty was not enough for the police and administration of UP and the local government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath which gives them their orders. On the night of 30th September, they took away her dead body. Her motherтАЩs pleas to be allowed one last look at her were ignored. Then, barricading her family in their house so they could not attend or perform funeral rites, the police forcibly and hurriedly cremated her body at 2:30 am to erase all evidence in the case. Not isolated events What is most shocking is that far from being an isolated crime, this is part of a systematic attack on women and oppressed castes. Three other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim's remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered - rape is suspected - and in Azamgarh an 8-year-old girl was raped. While attacks on Dalits and women have escalated vastly all over India since 2014, when the Hindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideology came to power, the Adityanath government in UP has seen by far the largest number of attacks and atrocities. For example, in 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to IndiaтАЩs annual National Crime Record BureauтАЩs тАЬCrime in IndiaтАЭ 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits - 26% of all cases reported. We are deeply concerned about where this is leading India and more specifically the state of Uttar Pradesh. We hope you are able to take action: Urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dismiss Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Set up an international enquiry into the Hathras rape case and other rapes and crimes against women, particularly Dalit and oppressed caste women in UP since the Adityanath government came to power in the state.

In the last few decades of the 18th century, under the influence of Mahatma PhuleтАЩs Satyashodhak Samaj, it was transformed into a musical weapon of the masses, against the caste system. By the 1930s, the тАШSatyashodhaki jalsaтАЩ was in decline, but a powerful new force had emerged in its place: тАШAmbedkari jalsaтАЩ. Ambedkari jalsa represented the teachings and philosophy of Dr BR Ambedkar in oral form, accompanied by songs. Over a journey that is close to completing a century, many Ambedkarite shahirs have helped hone shahiri as an anti-caste tool. This series on MaharashtraтАЩs shahirs explores the lives and work of 15 greats. This is part thirteen of the series. тАФ Art by Satwick Gade *** Sambhaji Bhagat needs no introduction. Among the shahirs of the past and present, he is the most discussed by the Marathi and English media. At a time when technology has enabled the propagation of Brahminical values at a mass scale, he continues to perform in slums and neglected neighbourhoods across Maharashtra. He is the voice of the anti-caste conscience. Because his ideological standpoint is Ambedkarism, his work has widened the horizons of Dalit art. His music enabled the people to understand the complexities of oppression in a simplified manner. Sambhaji's work is the result of and an example of the intersection of music and ideology, thus making it an educative tool тАФ even for upper caste people whose worldview is coloured by caste-based prejudice. For him, there is no separation between art and politics; in fact, as a shahir, his art is his politics. Born on 1 June, 1959 in the district of Satara, his perspective towards using music for a cause was shaped by listening to Dalit artists. However, it was only in 1979 when he came to Mumbai to study that he was initiated into the тАШpolitics of artтАЩ. He had the songs; Mumbai nurtured his vision. Initially, he was exposed to leftist politics, and later, to the Ambedkarite movement. This time period marked the decline of the Dalit Panthers and the rise of the Namantar Movement. It was a time of intellectual churning, and many shahirs had to re-think their approach towards art. With this realisation, Sambhaji Bhagat went back to the basics of Ambedkari jalsa: Shahiri should reach the last man, the most marginalised, in the society. After spending a year in the city, he was witness to members of the Avhan Natya Manch (of which Shahir Vilas Ghogare was also a member) performing a street play in Churchgate on a humid day. He was thrilled at the performance; for him, it was not just a cultural phenomenon but also profoundly political. Though he is a playwright and writer too, he is an Ambedkari lokashahir first and foremost. The purpose of his shahiri is the creation a society where people are treated equally тАФ a Prabuddha Bharat тАФ and have basic rights and liberties; where people will interact with each other respectfully. His words have also helped to heal wounds. Through the course of his impactful career, he has written powadas, bharuds, plays, songs, poems, and an autobiography. The Marathi play Shivaji Underground in Bhimnagar Mohalla, which has received an excellent response тАФ full houses across the year тАФ was originally conceptualised by him. He also wrote the songs and composed the music for it. The play is historic, because it is a retelling of the original story of Shivaji, which was appropriated by right-wing political outfits in Maharashtra. As a departure from what previous Ambedkari shahirs had done in their careers, he also wrote songs and sang them for a Marathi movie, Nagrik. He was instrumental in the making of the movie Court, which won a National Film Award in 2015. Though the story is told from an upper caste location, the fact that he and his music in the movie stand for the anti-caste movement is still evident. When writing about him, many savarna writers and journalists have often reduced him to labels тАФ тАШDalit artistтАЩ or тАШDalit singerтАЩ тАФ never according him the recognition that they would give to non-Dalit artists. In a conversation I had with him in 2015 (which was published in Roundtable India), he told me: тАЬPost-modernism is eroding the significance of ideology... What we must do? We should not interfere in the work others are doing. People must be engaged in creative endeavours... People criticise me, but I respond to them through my plays, songs, poetry, and through my art.тАЭ  *** Also read parts one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and twelve of this series.

While he was of Shudra background, his ideas, work and actions have had an invaluable liberatory impact on Dalits. Born in 1827 before the widespread Adi-movements, Phule was the first to propound caste as subjugation and oppression on indigenous peoples by invaders. He stressed that caste was equivalent to slavery, as vicious and brutal as the enslavement of Africans in the Americas and unique in its deception and religious sanction. In his revolutionary book, Gulamgiri (Slavery) published in 1873, Jyotirao included a manifesto which amongst other things declared that he was willing to dine with all regardless of their caste, creed or country of origin and that social salvation was to be found only in the education of women and Dalits. This content was deemed extremely controversial at the time and several newspapers blatantly refused to publicize it. He believed that Shudras were a group of people who had suffered added repression and persecution because they had at one time been actively engaged in fighting invading Brahmanism on the ground. His salvation describes the unity of the Shudras and Adi-Shudras (Dalits) into one exploited mass of people rising up in powerful political unity. He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, became pioneers of womenтАЩs education in India, and together started the first school for girls on January 1st 1848 at BhideтАЩs wada in Pune. They also started schools in which they educated both girls and тАЬlowerтАЭ Castes. Like many anti-caste revolutionaries, he felt a strong need to establish an alternative religion to the one that was oppressing his people. What he began then, lead him to form the Satya Shodhak Samaj (Society of Seekers of Truth) whose main objectives were to liberate the Shudras and Adi -Shudras and prevent exploitation by Brahminism within a strong context of gender equality. His life-long work for equality has recognized when Phule was publicly conferred the title of Mahatma on 11th May 1888 and later even termed the тАЬMartin Luther King of IndiaтАЭ by his biographer Dhananjay Keer. Dr.Ambedkar proudly declared that Phule was one of his three spiritual mentors. His birthday continues to be a celebration all around the world where Dalits, Adivasis and Bahujan honour him on Mahatma Phule Jayanthi! Jai Bhim! Jai Phule!

In the last few decades of the 18th century, under the influence of Mahatma PhuleтАЩs Satyashodhak Samaj, it was transformed into a musical weapon of the masses, against the caste system. By the 1930s, the тАШSatyashodhaki jalsaтАЩ was in decline, but a powerful new force had emerged in its place: тАШAmbedkari jalsaтАЩ. Ambedkari jalsa represented the teachings and philosophy of Dr BR Ambedkar in oral form, accompanied by songs. Over a journey that is close to completing a century, many Ambedkarite shahirs have helped hone shahiri as an anti-caste tool. This series on MaharashtraтАЩs shahirs explores the lives and work of 15 greats. This is part ten of the series. тАФ Art by Satwick Gade *** With the arrival of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar into the social and political life of India in the 1920s, the cultural politics of the country too, changed incredibly. Not only did he become the influence behind new, emerging narratives, but his ideas were also central to determining the anatomy of various art forms, whether it was the literature, the music or the shahiri that Dalits would go on to create. The ideas put forth by Dr Ambedkar find a great presence in the life and work of Shahir Arjun Hari Bhalerao. The story of his jalsa, which features the тАШAmbedkari Jalsa TadwalkaranchaтАЩ created by him, is a prominent example of how, in the wake of Ambedkar's anti-caste movement, music by Dalits imagined a humanitarian world for us тАФ an idea which was missing in a world where the gruesome practice of untouchability was (and still is) prevalent. Born on 1 December 1904, Arjun Hari Bhalerao grew up in a family of shahirs. During the 1920s, his uncle Laxman Bhalerao helmed a tamasha troupe which was famous in the region of Usmanabad, Beed and Latur. Wherever this troupe would go, Laxman Bhalerao used to take Arjun with him. Having been exposed to the life of tamasha artists, and subsequently to music, Arjun developed a keen sense of the music that was being produce by Dalits, as well as their lives and struggle. Such was the impact of the powerful narratives of anti-caste jalsas, like the Satyashodhak Jalsa, that he would not pay heed to the dangerous conditions around him. In 1924, an epidemic of plague had taken its toll on the region he was living in. Even in such a situation, he made sure to be present at the Satyashodhak Jalsa of Ramchandra Ghadge, which possessed undisputed fame during this era. He once mentioned, тАЬFour to five people used to die every day. The image of the light from the flames of the burning bodies, which could be seen from both sides of the river, was depressing. But I was so moved by this jalsa that I would use the light created by the flames of these burning bodies to find my way to it.тАЭ But it was only in 1927 that he realised the jalsa's potential to bring about change in the society. In the same year, he was selected for a teacherтАЩs training program in Pune, and the following year, he was appointed as a teacher in the village of Kasabe Tadawale. This was at the peak of AmbedkarтАЩs movement. In the Tadwale village, a newspaper called AmbedkarтАЩs Janata was being read dedicatedly, because it spoke about the suffering and issues of Dalits тАФ it became their voice. Arjun Hari Bhalerao too was influenced by it, and he started writing as a result. Though he began by writing songs, he realised that the jalsa is a much more effective medium to disseminate Babasaheb Ambedkar's words. Kasabe Tadwale was the village of many tamasha artists. However, many of them had to move out of the village in order to survive and take up any sort of job that came their way. Hunger was thus an impediment to achieving an anti-caste vision. Bhalerao perhaps realised this. The formation of an Ambedkarite jalsa wasnтАЩt an easy task. He had to first convince artists about the ideas he was intending to perform, and then he had to make sure that practice sessions would be regular. Despite the lack of adequate funds and costumes for performances, Bhalerao was determined to form a jalsa that would spread AmbedkarтАЩs words to the people. But the obstacles he faced weren't just material ones. In 1947, he and members of his jalsa had a close brush with death during a performance in the district of Latur. When Brahmins and Marathas in the region found out that the jalsa was going to be performed, they were ready to attack those who were directly associated with it and those supported it. In spite of these difficulties, he and his jalsa continued to perform. He explored forms within the jalsa, such as 'wagg', 'gaulan' and farce. Sample one of the earliest 'kawans' he wrote: Mahne Arjuna gulamgirichi! Hoti bedi annyachi! Shikvun soda bal! Purana gela tumcha kaal! (Arjuna talks about slavery! Of the shackles of injustice! Educate your child ! your past destroyed by Puranas!) It must be noted that the era when he performed with his jalsa was a time of radical social and cultural change among Dalits тАФ a period when talking about caste injustice and attempts to promote education were nothing short of revolutionary. Ekmekanchya warkhali! Kiti varsh vaya geli! Eki nahi tumchi jhali! Jhali re seema! (Living as inferior and superior! How many years have been destroyed! We did not unite! This is the limit now)  Despite creating an influential body of work and being one of the shahir-cum-jalsakars who took Ambedkar and his ideas to the most marginalised people across villages, his work is still not known to many today. Dyanewshwar Dhaware, an author of Ambedakari Jalsa Tadwalkarancha succinctly explains the reason behind this. тАЬFrom the period of Maharaki before the 1940s to the period after the 1960s, social life had been completely changed. Old occupations were abandoned. This community [Dalits], which used to work in the jalsa, was trying to adjust and adapt to the new means of livelihood. During these 20 long years, people who worked in the jalsa itself had begun to forget the times of the jalsa.тАЭ As Babasaheb Ambedkar once suggested, even ideas die if there is no one to spread them. Arjun Hari Bhalerao died on 17 February 1992. If one examines the conditions he grew up and lived in, the music he created and the anti-caste movement he led, it can be said without a doubt that he will always remain a hero, regardless of the extent of his reach. He used music not just to entertain, but also to educate. *** Also read parts one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine of this series.

"220",2140,"https://www.hastakshepnews.com/corona-crisis-and-dalit-scenario/","Corona Crisis and Dalit Scenario | hastakshep news","Posted By: hastakshep news 13th April 2020 According to the 2011 Economic and Caste Census, 4.42 crore families out of total families in India belong to the Scheduled Castes (Dalits). Only 23% of these families live in good houses, 2% in habitable houses and 12% in dilapidated houses. 24% of these families live in grass pallet, polythene and mud houses. It is clear from these figures that most of the Dalits do not even have a habitable house. Many Dalits do not even own their house land. It is also well-known that most of the Dalits and Adivasis are living in these slums. It can be estimated how physical distancing is possible to prevent Corona in these small houses and huts with large families. Dharvi Slum of Maharashtra is its biggest example where Corona infection cases are turning up very fast. If this situation continues, the chances of its spread are very high. According to the above Census only 3.95% Dalit families have government jobs. Only 0.93% have state sector and only 2.47% have private sector employment. It is clear from this that Dalit families are the biggest victims of unemployment. It is worth meditating that despite 70 years of reservation being implemented, why the representation of Dalit families in government jobs is only 3.95%? Has there not been enough dishonesty in the implementation of reservation? Have not the Dalits been cheated openly in the name of merit and have not been deprived of their constitutional right (share)? Even if the false reasoning of lack of merit among the Dalits is accepted, then who is responsible for not allowing merit to grow among Dalits in so many years? It has emerged in this Census that only 83.55% of the Dalit families in the country have a monthly income of more than 5,000. Only 11.74% of households have monthly income between 5,000 and 10,000 and only 4.67% of families have income above 10,000. Only 3.56% of the families have a monthly income of more than 5,000 from a government job. It is clear from these figures that the percentage of Dalits below poverty line is very high; due to which Dalits are the worst victims of malnutrition. Similarly, according to the above Census, 56% of the households in rural areas are landless. Of these, the percentage of landless Dalits can be more than 70 to 80%. The condition of landlessness of Dalits is their biggest weakness due to which they remain completely dependent on the landholding castes. Similarly, 51% of the households in the countryside are Manual Labour, out of which the percentage of Dalits can be more than 70 to 80%. According to the Census, only 18.45% of Dalit families have nonirrigated land, 17.41% have irrigated land and 6.98% have other land. It is clear from it that the landlessness of Dalits is about 91%. Dalit labourers have maximum dependence on agricultural wages. According to the Census, only 30% of the households in the countryside get employment in agriculture, so it can be estimated how many Dalits can get employment in agriculture. This is the reason that Dalits are the most migrated labour from the village to the cities. In the recent times of Corona crisis, the majority of them are Dalits who have migrated from the cities to the village in reverse migration. The landlessness of Dalits and the compulsion of Manual Labour is their biggest weakness. For this reason, they can neither demand high rates of agricultural wages nor are they able to strongly oppose the daily atrocities and oppression. Therefore, for Dalits, land and employment is their biggest requirement, but for this Modi government has no agenda. In contrast to this, the Modi government is making the Dalits landless by acquiring land and reducing employment opportunities in this area by not investing in agriculture. In other areas too, the government has failed miserably in generating employment. Due to privatization of public sector undertakings, the employment opportunities available to Dalits through reservation are also shrinking. In contrast, Dalit and other workers are being exploited openly by the contractual labour practice. The Modi government has harmed the workers by relaxing the labour laws. Due to this, open exploitation of labourers is taking place, whose biggest victims are the Dalit families. Current corona epidemic studies in the US have found that there are more black people among infected / deceased people than whites. Four main reasons have been cited for this: more poor health and less health facilities availability and discrimination, more Black Americans being engaged in essential services, insufficient information and smaller homes. In the case of Dalits in India, apart from all these factors, the biggest factor is social discrimination. That is why it is natural that in our country, like black Americans, Dalits and Adivasis being at the bottom of the society are likely to be the most affected by Corona. . The Dalits/Adivasis are going to suffer the most in jobs which have been lost due to the present Corona crisis. According to the recent estimates, about 40 crore people in India are likely to be unemployed as a result of Corona crisis and most of them are going to be Dalits. With this, the coming recession is going to have its worst effect on Dalits and other poor sections. It has also been seen that the relief announcements made by the government during the current crisis are completely inadequate and are the same as cumin seeds in the camelтАЩs mouth. In these schemes, such conditions are imposed on the eligibility that it is becoming impossible for the common man to get their benefits. The plight of Dalits in the Post Corona period is going to worsen because of the terrible economic recession as jobs are going to decrease enormously. Since Dalits do not have any means of production like land and trade, hence the effects of recession are going to have the most impact on Dalits. For this, it is important that Employment, like the Right to Food and Education, should also be made a Fundamental Right and the system of Unemployment Allowance should be implemented. Along with this, Health Security should also be made a fundamental right so that poor people also get health security. For this, it is necessary that the Democratic Socialistic Welfare Model of Development should be adopted in place of our present Capitalistic Model of Development. It is noteworthy that Dr. Ambedkar was a strong supporter of State Socialism (Democratic Socialism) and a staunch opponent of Capitalism. While addressing the conference of Depressed Classes Railway Workers Conference, he said that тАЬDalits have two big enemies, one is Brahmanism and the other is Capitalism.тАЭ He was very much in favour of the political power in the hands the working class. The framework of socialism was very clear in Dr. AmbedkarтАЩs mind. He considered it indispensable for the social transformation and economic development of India. He had also presented its outline to the nation in his draft of the future Constitution of India which is available in the form of a book called тАЬStates and MinoritiesтАЭ. He was in favour of having all major and basic industries and insurance under state control, nationalization of agricultural land and collective farming. He was in favour of giving agriculture the status of state industry. Dr. Ambedkar did not want to make the right to property a fundamental right, but it was not under his control. The present Corona crisis has proved that the Capitalistic Model of Development in most countries including India has promoted exploitation and inequality. It has failed miserably to solve basic problems of common people. Ever since the corporatization of politics and the importance of finance capital have increased, since then democracy has turned into a monopoly of totalitarianism and rightist stance. The fact has also emerged from this Corona crisis that only socialist countries like Cuba, Vietnam and China have been able to face this crisis. Only their democratic socialistic system is capable of protecting the life of mankind. Otherwise you must have heard about US President Donald Trump wherein he says that about two and a half million Americans have to die from Corona and he cannot do anything in it. This is the tragic call of the supreme model of capitalism, showing that the capitalist system that thrives on profits is completely hollow. Therefore, protecting the interests of Dalits is also possible in the Democratic Socialist polity only. BabasahebтАЩs vision will come true only when Dalits, getting free from BSP, Athawale, Ramvilas and other people engaged in the service of capitalists, will join hands with radical agenda like land distribution, employment, health security, education and dignity based democratic socialist politics. Only this politics will establish a welfare state in which the challenges of the post-Corona period can be answered. The All India PeopleтАЩs Front is an attempt of democratic socialist mass politics.   Sharing is caring! You must log in to post a comment. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Ambedkar Jayanti (or Bhim Jayanti) has been celebrated as a public holiday in most parts of the country since the year 2015 to commemorate his life and work and the crusade he led to guarantee the upliftment of the lower castes and тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ in India. BR Ambedkar, also lovingly called тАЬBabasahebтАЭ, was also one of the key advocates for complete independence from the British imperialist forces and his inputs laid the foundation of what came to be the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). He had received IndiaтАЩs highest civilian award тАУ the Bharat Ratna тАУ posthumously, 40 years after he passed away.

He urged the state government to come up with a comprehensive financial package for them. While the community has been flooded with тАЬdosтАЭ and тАЬdonтАЩtsтАЭ on how to observe Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14, the government has not addressed the crucial question of how these workers are going to feed themselves and their families, Kamble said. тАЬDalits constitute majority of the workforce in the unorganised sector, both in urban and rural areas. Therefore, this is a segment that is among the worst-hit financially. With no daily earnings, they are at the receiving end,тАЭ he said. In Maharashtra, landless Dalits account for 81 per cent of farm labourers. They work on othersтАЩ farms. With agricultural activities at a standstill, these workers are struggling for their daily meal. тАЬThe entire food supply chain should have been defined under emergency category. This would have helped avoid the recurring conflicts we are seeing between the police, civic authorities and administration, which is determined to enforce the lockdown,тАЭ Kamble said. In urban areas, Dalits are mostly daily wagers in the service sector, almost 75 per cent of which is now shut. Ambedkar Jayanti on Tuesday is being used by several Dalit organisations to highlight the communityтАЩs plight. While acknowledging that staying at home was necessary, they believe the government should also address their problems. On Monday, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar urged people to commemorate Ambedkar Jayanti тАЬdigitallyтАЭ. Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal called for celebrations by reading AmbedkarтАЩs life and teachings. Social Justice Minister Dhananjay Munde appealed to people to stay safe at home. Last week, Republican Party of India chief and Union Minister for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale urged Dalits to light lamps. A senior Ambedkarite said, тАЬThere is an overdose of dos and donтАЩts from every political party and prominent leaders on how to celebrate AmbedkarтАЩs birth anniversary. It is good. But unfortunately, the same should also reflect when it comes to reaching the poor Dalits basic foodgrain.тАЭ Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar said, тАЬOur field experience is, food supply is not effective.

BSP chief Mayawati has demanded stern action against a BJP MP for his involvement in a case of assault against a Dalit tehsildar in Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati took to Twitter urging UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to intervene and ensure that the incident is not repeated. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Subrat Pathak, accompanied by 20 to 25 men, had allegedly broken into the house of the tehsildar, Arvind Kumar, and assaulted him over the distribution of ration to people mentioned in a list sent by him. In a series of tweets, Mayawati wrote, ""The incident from Kannauj where an honest Dalit tehsildar was beaten by a BJP MP is shameful. What is more concerning is that he is still roaming scot-free instead of going to jail."" Demanding that Adityanath look into the matter, she wrote that non-repetition of such an act with any Dalit in the state must be ensured. ""Stern action is needed against the MP. This is what the BSP demands,"" she wrote. A case has been registered against Pathak and 25 unidentified men, and around 10 vehicles seized from the site of the assault. Speaking to media, the tehsildar had earlier said that he had explained to the MP over the phone that other senior officials were looking into the distribution of ration to people mentioned in his list. However, despite the explanation, the lawmaker abused and threatened him. Sometime later, Pathak and his aides barged into his house and thrashed him, he had said. Pathak's supporters have denied the incident, saying that they had gone only to discuss some development projects with Kumar.

Navlakha, who has been accused under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon riots in 2018, was asked to surrender by the Supreme Court. Editor of Mumbai-based Economic and Political Weekly journal for years, Navlakha was one of the five human rights activists arrested for alleged Maoist links and involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence on January 1, 2018 but was granted protection from the arrest by the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court. A day before his arrest, Teltumbde wrote an open letter saying, ""Taking shelter under the draconian provisions of the UAPA, that renders a person defenseless, I am being jailed."" He added that what happened to him could happen to ""anyone"". ""As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim moment. Well, I am off to NIA custody and do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes,тАЭ he wrote. Teltumbde and other activists were initially booked by the Pune Police following violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima there. According to police, the activists made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence the next day. The police also said these activists were active members of banned Maoist groups. The case was later transferred to the NIA. Teltumbde and Navlakha were given interim protection by the Bombay High Court while their pre-arrest bail pleas were being heard. After the high court rejected their applications, the duo approached the Supreme Court. On March 17, the apex court rejected their pleas and directed them to surrender within three weeks. On April 9, the Supreme Court granted the duo another week to surrender by way of last chance.

Revenue officer Arvind Kumar was allegedly beaten by the BJP's Kannauj MP Subrat Pathak and his supporters on Tuesday. ""Manhandling and misbehavior with a dalit 'tehsildar, who was discharging his duty honestly, by the BJP MP in Kannauj recently is very shameful,"" Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi. In a separate tweet she said, ""It's saddening that instead of going to jail, this MP is roaming outside due to which dalit employees are agitated. In such circumstances, the chief minister should initiate strict action against this MP so that he does not repeat such an incident in the future."" ""BSP demands strict action against the MP so that such behaviour is not meted out to any other Dalit employee in the state,"" she said. Kumar had alleged that Pathak was pressurising him to sanction some projects which flouted rules and when he refused, the leader verbally abused him on the phone and later arrived at his residence along with his supporters and beat him up. Pathak, however, said the official had failed to properly distribute food among the poor and also misbehaved with his supporters. ""I was continuously getting complaints from the poor regarding distribution of food and when I took up the matter with him (Kumar) he reacted indecently,"" Pathak had said. The MP had also alleged that the Kumar misbehaved with his supporters and beat them up. A case has been registered against the MP under the SC/ST Act and other sections of the IPC and a probe is on.

"227",2181,"https://dnd.com.pk/a-letter-from-dalit-student-rohith-vemula-to-unesco/186191","A letter from Dalit student Rohith Vemula to UNESCO","By Nasreen Jehan On January 17, 2016, a dead body was found in University of Hyderabad India. Dead body was of a Voice тАФ A voice for Dalits. Leader of Ambedkar Students Association Rohith Vemula who was forced to commit suicide. He was not the first or the last Dalit student who was murdered but he was first who left тАЬtold storiesтАЭ in a world where Dalit are murdered with тАЬuntold storiesтАЭ. Police believe that he had committed suicide while his friends and students of university believe that it was a тАЬsystematic murderтАЭ and an тАЬengineered suicideтАЭ because he was so marginalized and compelled by circumstances developed by university administration around him that he might have committed suicide. However, majority of his close friends believe he could not commit suicide and case needs deep investigation. This case was stored in cold-storage of Indian legal system. According to his close friends he was one of the activists on hunger strike from January 16 on the campus against the illegal and demonstrably false case framed against them by the administration. Rohith went out of the tent to a hostel and hanged himself, leaving a suicide note. It was at the behest of BJP leader Bandaru Datttreya who started persecuting Dalit students and scholars. There are several Dalit who were either denied higher education or were dumped in Unemployment lot after receiving higher education. This is the fate of low-caste people in India but such treatment of humans by Indian society never gets attention of international media which sees India with a different lensesтАФlenses of a country having huge economy and high trade linkages with western and middle eastern countries. Rohith was the man of action while most of the rest of low-caste Hindus are either taking a break or retired. Political paradigm on central universities in Hindutva persecutes who talk about discrimination against Muslims and worked to bring Dalits and Muslims together to combat it. Rohith so-called suicide note exposes those facts which are hidden behind heavy curtains Indian media and establishment throw on the eyes of international Right Organisations and foreign media. 251-days lockdown in Indian Occupied Kashmir is another fact which is not seen by the world. Whatever happened in Delhi massacre recently and what was happened in Jamia and NJU universities is forgotten. Let us have a look to letter Rohith left to know how Indian establishment persecutes Muslims and Dalits. Rohith Vemula Here is his Letter: Good morning,I would not be around when you read this letter. DonтАЩt get angry on me. I know some of you truly cared for me, loved me and treated me very well. I have no complaints on anyone. It was always with myself I had problems. I feel a growing gap between my soul and my body. And I have become a monster. I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. At last, this is the only letter I am getting to write.I loved Science, Stars, Nature, but then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our feelings are second handed. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs colored. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt.The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. As a glorious thing made up of star dust. In very field, in studies, in streets, in politics, and in dying and living. I am writing this kind of letter for the first time. My first time of a final letter. Forgive me if I fail to make sense.My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past.May be I was wrong, all the while, in understanding world. In understanding love, pain, life, death. There was no urgency. But I always was rushing. Desperate to start a life. All the while, some people, for them, life itself is curse. I am not hurt at this moment. I am not sad. I am just empty. Unconcerned about myself. ThatтАЩs pathetic. And thatтАЩs why I am doing this.People may dub me as a coward. And selfish, or stupid once I am gone. I am not bothered about what I am called. I donтАЩt believe in after-death stories, ghosts, or spirits. If there is anything at all I believe, I believe that I can travel to the stars. And know about the other worlds. If you, who is reading this letter can do anything for me, I have to get 7 months of my fellowship, one lakh and seventy-five thousand rupees. Please see to it that my family is paid that. I have to give some 40 thousand to Ramji. He never asked them back. But please pay that to him from that.Let my funeral be silent and smooth. Behave like I just appeared and gone. Do not shed tears for me. Know that I am happy dead than being alive. тАЬFrom shadows to the stars.тАЭ To ASA family, sorry for disappointing all of you. You loved me very much. I wish all the very best for the future. For one last time, Jai Bheem  Would you like to read another letter which is sent by Rohith from the world he lives now? Let me share this letter with you also: I was never a coward. I was follower of Ambedkar and I was a Comrade. I was grown up from a poor background, in a home at Savitribhai Nagar in Guntur where my mother brought me up by tailoring, which she continued till I got admission in Ph.D. I did not get admission in Ph.D in one attempt. I was hurdled to get PhD admission twice just because of the oppressive attitudes of bureaucracy and brahminical mindsets of a few, even while having an exceptional double JRF in hand. I knew brahminical mindsets would not allow me to get degree and I was ready to sacrifice my life because I know I have to sacrifice for those Dalits and Muslims who have dreams in their eyes. Will India be a normal country? I am going but you who love me have to work hardтАФstand against BJP kind of mindset otherwise this country would become hell for 1.25 billion people including high caste Hindus also because hate never allows anybody to flourishтАФirrespective of his caste, colour and social background. I felt pain when my mother was dragged in Delhi but media kept silent. My mother went to India Gate to pay respects to me (Rohith), in a candle light procession. She was dragged by the police and later detained by the Delhi police along with others. The news was barely covered by the mainstream media. One wonders why such a serious incident was looked over by the media when my mother was being humiliated? My mother wants to ask you (Nation) why did me and other Dalit students got branded as an anti-national in the first place? Do we (Dalits and low-caste Hindus and Muslims have no right on education? If yes, why we are not allowed higher education? I want to ask authorities of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that you are responsible for equal rights for education to all and believe that you work for filling gaps between poor and rich, between powerful and powerless but you do not see what India does to its poor strata of society? Did you write any letter to Indian authorities on my systematic murder? Did you ask Indian education system why I and thousands like me are persecute in Indian educational system? I know you did not write and you will not because India is a strong economy and UN stands for India alwaysтАФfrom Kashmir issue to Assam and from Assam to Manipur. I give a damn to all of youтАФ You UN or UNESCO. You stand only for powerful and crush powerless people. Thank you for reading my letter.

"230",2220,"https://countercurrents.org/2020/04/covid19-and-issues-of-basic-amenities-in-dalit-hamlets-of-odisha/","COVID19 and Issues of Basic Amenities in Dalit Hamlets of Odisha | Countercurrents"," This pandemic (COVID -19) situation is hitting the marginalized poor the worst because of their inherent vulnerable condition. The entire country is being converted to a police state with an absolute power exercised by police to mercilessly beat anyone on street. It is mostly the poor and marginalized on the streets who are being harassed and humiliated. The socially and economically privileged groups with, advantageous access, to all kinds of opportunities are relatively in a better-off position to face the crisis. Religious fanatics and privileged castes brigade continue to preach their kinds of congenital hegemonic binary everywhere mainly governance, media, academics, CSOs which have been generalizing the victimization without differentiation. But when most daily wage earners and other poor are being asked to stay at home, along with to maintain physical distancing, the governing system has forgotten they have been struggling for a living with inadequate basic amenities, water and sanitation, and are surviving in a mere small living space called as home for the whole three generation family staying under the common roof. LetтАЩs look at Dalit hamlets in rural villages of Odisha and the status of basic amenities in the context of COVID19 and implementation of measures such as hand wash and physical distancing, and lockdown at home, etc. Continued practices of Untouchability and atrocities in rural areas: In spite of protective legislations against practices of untouchability and atrocities such as PCR Act 1955 and POA Act 1989.In the year 2018, the state has witnessed 1810 reported cases of atrocities against SCs ranging from rape, assault on women and children, murder, rioting, attempt to commit murder, hurt, house burning, arson, physical assault, and many more forms of heinous crime along with unabated practices of untouchability in many forms in rural villages. The National Records Bureau report for the year 2018 says that 10000 numbers of atrocities cases have been pending for trial, in different courts of the state, where as the conviction rate was only 3 percent. Non official survey revealed that about 200 different forms of untouchability practice have been existing in rural villages. It includes residential segregation, seating separately in Aganwadi centers, during mid-day meal in schools, separate hostels for students, separate bathing place, drinking water sources, cremation ground, two glass system in tea stalls and eateries, not allowed in saloons and public places, temples, honour killing to prevent inter caste marriage and many more. Persistent Poverty, unemployment and distress migration: The incidence of poverty is very high among Scheduled Castes .Odisha Economic Survey 2018 reports that 42 percent of Scheduled Caste households are under BPL mark, which is extremely high than the state average of 33 percent( 2011-12). As 2011 SECC census published in 2015 only 0.80 SCs households were in salaried jobs in private sector. It is not just about the income or dignified employment but most Dalit households also lack of productive assets such as Land, access to formal credit and quality education. Agriculture census and SECC 2011 very well established the fact that a vast majority of SCs population are landless and without Record of Rights (ROR) over their homestead land in possession. Though nearly 85 percent SCs rural household depend on agriculture for livelihood as sharecroppers and agricultural workers. Agriculture in Odisha is seasonal in nature due to lack of irrigation facilities. And also has been more prone to regular natural calamities such as flood, cyclone, erratic rainfall, drought etc. having a direct bearing over the life of the rural scheduled caste families. Agricultural workers get the lowest paid minimum wage because they are officially being treated as unskilled workers. There has been lack of official census about social composition of agricultural workers and there has been no social security measures for these section of rural workers in spite of social security laws being enacted for rural unorganized sector workers since 2008. The seasonal migration among workers within the state and outside the state is very high due to lack of employment as well as low wage rate along with practices of social discrimination. In the absence of organizations of agricultural workers and share croppers, the protagonist of farmers organizations in the state never ponder over the issues of share croppers and agriculture workers as all-encompassing of agriculture sector as whole and for its inclusive development. Basic amenities: Basic amenities are bare necessities for a dignified life and healthy living. It includes a piece of land of own for an identity to securely construct a house , safe drinking water, toilet, electricity, all weather linking road from home to main road etc. The Constitution of India under Article 19 (e) says that тАШall citizens shall have right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and rights to shelter is a fundamental rightтАЩ. Under Article 21 Right to Life is a natural human right and the Constitution protects Right to Life and livelihood and Right to Health as an integral part of Right to Life. A recent survey in Odisha found that out of about 6000 SCs household covered under the survey in 8 Tahasils of 5 districts, 60% of the household are landless without any homestead land. They have been staying over since generations on so called Govt. land, land belongs to ex -Jamindars, former kings, CPR of the village, forest land, on the bank of village pond , river, irrigation canal, roads and amidst of Paddy fields, coconut stretches, etc. Homestead land is central to access all other facilities of basic amenities and for implementation of any programme of basic amenities land is a basic requirement. Social Activists who have been instrumental in filing claims for homestead land under OGLS Act 1972 in many places of the state in opinion that their experience shows more than 90% of the applications have been pending without proper inquiry since years together without any time frame for disposal of these application of genuine landless poor. Many of the landless poor daily wage earners are being routinely visiting Tahsail and RI offices but getting harassed with delay in getting their entitlement rights. Along with homestead land it is found that many of the Dalit hamlets have no all-weather linking road connecting to the main road and they have also no cremation ground and other common place for community activities. As they have been deprived up getting access to land-based common property resources of village due to practices of untouchability though it has been prevented under PCR Act and POA Act but the ground reality have not been changed yet. Many of the hamlets have lack of all-weather linking road and in spite of repeated attempts by the community there has been no action by the local Govt. authorities. In many places the hamlets are surrounded by private lands owned by dominant caste villagers and usually they do not allow Dalit to trespass over their private land and many places the filed divider line (HIDA, local name) is the main link of communication from hamlet to main road. Housing: The Dalit habitations in the state of Odisha are very well demarcated by its look from outside. Most of the houses are single room and without any separate facility such as kitchen, store room, drawing room, bed room and bath room etc. NSS 76th round report 2018 revealed that 59 percent of rural household living in Puuca houses, 23 percent in semi-puuca, and 16 percent in Kacha houses in the state. It is unfortunate that for centuries together a majority chunk of Dalit population is being forced to live in the most undignified life .The housing policy of Govt. has not taken care of basic human needs and plan in a very discriminatory manner targeting the marginalized section of our society. There are two major housing schemes one by central Govt. that is PMAY (Rural) with state share and the other is Biju Pucca Ghara Yojana and for mining area and construction workers and MO Kudia. A survey found that many of the potential beneficiaries are deprived up getting house under such schemes because they have no land and there has been huge nepotism in the selection of beneficiaries at panchayat level. The houses have been not completed in time and there are number of houses being half made and remain incomplete due to administrative issues. Drinking water: The census 2011 only 7.5 percent of rural household had access to tap water where as it was 30.8 percent at national level. National Rural Drinking Water Supply Programme web site says only 26 percent of habitation in Odisha have piped water supply as on April 2018. Survey of 200 hamlets shows 7 percent of households have access to piped water facility where as 58 percent depend on tube well and 8 percent on wells and 8 percent on boring . Out of total tube well only 1 percent have solar tube well. About 1/3 of the hamlets have been facing serious water crisis in summer where mostly the Dalit women in summer still go to river beds and Nalas and other local тАШwaterтАЩ sources to dig small pits to get water. Every day women have to walk and spend their quality time to fetch water, this has been a regular exercise in summer in a majority of the hamlets. In few hamlets the quality of water is not hygienic for consumption because of arsenic and iron contains. Dalit women in multi caste villages face discrimination while collecting water from common sources, a normalized practice for them now. In some places, the caste people wash the tube well used by Dalit women or sometimes Dalit women have to call some caste women to help get the water without touching the tube well. Toilet: Under the Swachha Bharat Mission (Gramin) the state of Odisha has been declared as open defecation free but the reality is something else in the context of Dalit. Sanitation is a major issue of Dalit as a majority of the household depend on open defecation in the absence of toilet with water facility. Dalit families face social humiliation while going out for open defecation in private lands of upper caste and also in common property resources of the village. Mostly women prefer to go in the evening or early before sunrise to avoid the public eyes. Ina survey we found 57 percent of the household have toilets constructed under Govt. scheme and rest 43 percent have no toilet but majority of the household having toilets are not using it. Women, children and elderly people have been facing an extremely difficult situation in their day to life. It has ramification over family and social life, personal health and hygiene and its ultimate impact on living and working condition and economy. Electricity: Electricity is a basic human need and fundamental to socio-economic development. It is reported that 99.64 percent of the inhabited revenue village have been electrified by the end of 31st March 2019. But connected to the village does not mean connected to Dalit hamlets. Our survey shows about 5 percent of household have no connection at all. Discrimination in access to services and minimal presence as service provider: Ineffective implementation of affirmative action in education, service sector and other areas have deprived the SCs of the state form their participation in different sector of the state. It is being observed that scope of petty business is very limited due to hostile and discriminatory social environment in caste ridden rural Odisha. Students and employees from the Dalit community have been facing social discrimination in schools and offices and being socially segregated because of their low caste identity. The hostile, discriminatory and violence casteist attitude of the dominant privileged castes of the state and their socio-cultural hegemony continue unabated in the absence of progressive social movements and minimal enforcement of socially protective legislations. Public offices are getting communalized in religious line by celebrating religious functions in schools, colleges, universities and Govt. offices, police stations etc. There has been no attempt to socially secularize and democratize, at least, the public places build at the cost of state funding. Dalit people are not treated with dignity in local Govt. offices such as Police station, Tahasils, RI offices, Block offices, Panchyat office and Banks in rural areas. Very often they face extortion and negligence in dealing while they make any claim for rights and entitlements under different Govt. laws and provisions. There is no policy of social inclusiveness in recruitment of rural service providers such as Aganwadi and mid-day meal cooks and contractual appointments for facilitation of entitlements and services at panchyat level. The Dalit people very often face discrimination in getting access to services such as PDS and ANM centre in the village. There are 1.45 lakh cook cum helpers and 29 900 women self-help groups are engaged in MDM scheme operational in the state since 1995. There are thousands of contractual jobs being created in rural areas to facilitate effective service delivery system where SCs have almost very insignificant presence. This is denial of Right to participation and realization of basic human rights and entitlements for development. The said situation is just a tip of the iceberg but in the given conditions how will the poor marginalized section face the current situation. The very temporary relief measures of Govt. is not addressing any issues rather it will make them further vulnerable from bad to worst. It will make them further poorer. There are reports of discrimination in relief and quarantine centers and organized attack by police and local administration in Dalit hamlets. Dalit volunteers are not allowed to serve cook foods while Dalits are also served from distance by panchyat officials and so called social workers. While Humanitarian aid agencies, groups and individuals are advertising their great charity by projecting the helplessness of poor on street who are making large queue with begging bowel for food of the day. But in normal times they have no role in addressing the structural issues of huge inequality rather issues of different marginalized sections are sometimes seen as sectarian and disjointed from larger societal prospective. Why people from certain specific occupations are selectively praised for their duty as fighters as if people in others occupations are betraying the fight or they do not have any role at all. This media developed binaries also identifies media itself as one of the fighter. As if they are not part of this society and suddenly enter from some other planet as saviors. This is denial of collective spirit and responsibility of a nation and all its citizens who all have been contributing in different forms. It also seems that addressing pandemic is an additional constitutional responsibility of Govt. and people need to praise the leaders of Govt. because they are doing as extra constitutional job out of favor to the people of this country. People rating the performances of states and centre and making comparisons attaching political ideology and affiliations. Above all whose power and money it is? Does it belong to the people of this country or political parties and media have built this power and resources? Some of the political protests have become exhibitory routine work just to feel oneтАЩs own presence without any substantial impact and consequences and also large protest are disconnected from the larger politics of change of structural issues and become more event or dispute centric and in many cases serve a section with vested interest without larger social perspective.

Teltumbde was arrested by the NIA earlier in the day after he surrendered before it following the Supreme CourtтАЩs directives. He is the grandson-in-law of Dalit icon Dr BR Ambedkar, whose 129th birth anniversary is being observed on Tuesday. Civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha, a co-accused in the case, also surrendered before the NIA in Delhi. His anticipatory bail plea was also rejected by the apex court. Navlakha was to be produced before special NIA court here through video conference, but the court said since he had surrendered in Delhi, he will have to be produced before a court there first. An NIA lawyer said he would be produced before a court in the national capital for seeking his transit remand after which he will be brought to Mumbai. Teltumbde reached the NIA office here in the afternoon with his wife Rama Teltumbde and brother-in-law and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar and surrendered. In the court, the NIA sought ten-day custody of Teltumbde, but judge AT Wankhede granted it remand till only April 18. The Supreme Court on March 17 this year had rejected pre-arrest bail pleas of Anand Teltumbde and Navlakha, and directed them to surrender before the investigating agency. Teltumbde, Navlakha and nine other civil liberties activists have been booked under the stringent provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for having alleged Maoist links and conspiring to overthrow the government. The activists were booked initially by Pune police following violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima in the district. According to police, the activists made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence the next day during 200th commemoration of the battle of Bhima Koregaon. The police also said these activists were active members of banned Maoist groups. The case was later transferred to NIA. PTI  Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

The man was identified as Seraj Ahmad, a native of Bhujouli Khurd village of the district. He and four others are lodged at a quarantine centre set up in a primary school in the village, they said. Ahmad returned to the village from Delhi on March 29 and has been in quarantine at the centre, the police said.

A resident of Fariya Pipariya village which falls in Lakhimpur district, the Dalit youth, Roshan Lal worked as a daily wage worker in Gurugam. He had returned to his village on Sunday, March 29, six days after the Modi government announced nation wide lockdown. Since then he was living in the school of the village after the local administration had put him in quarantine. In a recorded audio clip, which Roshan Lal forwarded to his friend and family members on WhatsApp minutes before he committed suicide, he can be heard screaming and narrating the story of torture and humiliation in a very feeble voice. тАЬFriends, if someone does not believe then take off my pants and see. You will not find anything but blood-clotting all over my back. I am going to commit suicide after this as I do not want to live anymore. My hand has been broken.

"236",2249,"https://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/4/16/dalits-india-coronavirus-pandemic.html","Under India's caste system Dalits are considered untouchable. The coronavirus is intensifying that slur","By Priyali Sur, CNN Published Apr 16, 2020 8:51:48 AM (CNN) тАФ Polamma carefully descends the 250 steps from the hilltop slum where she lives in southern India to walk one kilometer to the nearest grocery store. She is nine months pregnant and has four children to feed, but at the bottom of the steps community leaders of a dominant caste force her to go back empty-handed. Since India went into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus on March 25, 57 families who live in Polamma's hilltop village in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, have been barred from going down the hill, even to purchase essentials such as food and medicine. The families are part of the Yanadi community, who work mainly as waste pickers and drain cleaners and who -- even before the coronavirus -- were segregated because of their caste. ""We've been locked up here, like prisoners -- we live near a milk factory, and there is not a drop of milk for my children to drink. We are called dirty and they say we spread the disease,"" said Polamma, who only goes by one name. India's caste system was officially abolished in 1950, but the 2,000-year-old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. The caste system categorizes Hindus at birth, defining their place in society, what jobs they can do and who they can marry. Those at the bottom of the hierarchy, who fall outside the four main categories of Brahmins (priests and teachers), Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers), Vaishyas (traders and merchants) and the Shudras (laborers), are considered ""untouchables"" or Dalits. Millions of people, about 25% of India's population of 1.3 billion people, are grouped under the scheduled castes (Dalits) and scheduled tribes (Adivasis) in India's constitution. Adivasis are indigenous Indians who have been socially and economically marginalized for centuries. Both groups have long endured social isolation, but it's feared the rapid spread of the coronavirus and measures to stop it have worsened their segregation. Jobs that Dalits and Adivasis have been forced to take for centuries -- cleaners, manual scavengers and waste pickers -- expose them to a greater risk of catching the virus. During the pandemic, their jobs are considered essential services by the Indian government, but many say they haven't been given adequate equipment to protect themselves against Covid-19. And if they get sick, there's no social safety net to ensure they don't fall even deeper into poverty. When the Spanish Flu pandemic ripped through India in 1918 killing almost 17 million people, caste played a crucial role in determining who received healthcare -- and who died. Lower caste people living in crowded slums were the most exposed to the virus, and the least able to find food and medicine as the flu spread, according to historian David Arnold, who has extensively researched and written about the Spanish Flu epidemic in India. Historian Amit Kapoor, author of Riding the Tiger, said 61 lower caste people died for every 1,000 in the community. For upper caste Hindus it was 19 for every 1,000, and the figure was even lower for Europeans living in India. However, Kapoor believes that while people belonging to the lower caste were disproportionately impacted in 1918, the situation now is different. ""While caste was very predominant in 1918, in 2020 the impact of epidemics have more to do with the economic hierarchy than the social hierarchy,"" said Kapoor. There's little doubt that lower caste Indians are poorer than higher castes. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)'s global multidimensional poverty index (MPI), half of scheduled tribes were considered poor compared to 15% of higher castes. Poverty makes lower castes more vulnerable during emergencies, according to the findings of a 2013 study by the International Dalit Solidarity Network, a network of international human rights groups fighting Dalit discrimination. For example, after the 2004 Asian Tsunami, Dalits were forced to remove bodies and debris, for very little if any pay, and weren't offered any psychological support. Many weren't compensated for their lost possessions, such as the bikes and fishing nets that were swept away, the report said. Dalit activists fear the coronavirus will again reinforce inequality in India. ""India has 600,000 villages and almost every village a small pocket on the outskirts is meant for Dalits,"" said Paul Divakar, a Dalit activist from the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights. ""This settlement is far from healthcare centers, banks, schools and other essential services. During times like Covid-19, the aid may not even reach this small pocket."" He said repeated advice on social distancing threatened to encourage the kind of behavior seen in the northern city of Bareilly when migrant workers were doused with bleach disinfectant. ""Covid-19 is legitimizing these actions all in the name of hygiene and social-distancing,"" said Divakar. Dalits are forced to take up the jobs such as cleaning, manual scavenging, working at brick kilns and leather-crafting -- occupations considered ""filthy"" or ""dishonorable"" for higher-caste communities. The sanitation and cleaning work formally and informally employs 5 million people, of which 90% belong to the lowest Dalit sub-castes, according to a five-month study of sanitation workers across India carried out in 2017 by Dalberg Advisors, a development policy and strategy firm, with the support of The Gates Foundation. The Indian government has deemed sanitation and cleaning to be essential services, which must continue during the lockdown. India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a directive that sanitation workers in hospitals and elsewhere should be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks and gloves. Sanitation workers clean hospitals for 7-8 hours a day but many say they have not been given sufficient, if any, protective gear, said Suryaprakash Solanke leader of a Dalit workers union in Mumbai. ""For years they have been cleaning and scrubbing hospitals, residential complexes, streets and railway stations. But instead of providing them with protective gear, and rewarding them, people are ostracizing them. Some have even been refused water to drink, when requested while at work,"" said Solanke. Vanita Bhaskar Salvi works as a sanitation worker in a hospital in the Mumbai district of Thane. She says she and her colleagues have only been given single-layered cloth masks to protect them from the virus while at work. ""We are lesser humans. We clean and wash the entire ward. When patients soil their clothes, we clean them up. All for 8,500 rupees ($115) a month. And now we are further at risk of disease as we have no protection gear when we touch and clean all the waste,"" she said. Salvi says she is scared of contracting the virus and would prefer not to go to work, but as the only one with a job in her family, she has no option. Kiran Dighavkar, officer at the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, the civic body governing Mumbai, said: ""There are enough kits with us for sanitation worker. Masks, gloves, kits, everything."" CNN reached out to officials in the Health and Labor ministry for comment on allegation insufficient PPE had been provided to sanitation workers but did not receive a response. The work Dalits do exposes them to another risk: discrimination. Sanoj Kumar left his job at a brick kiln in Tamil Nadu to return to his village near Bodh Gaya in Bihar before the lockdown was imposed. He said he faced ostracism as soon as he stepped off the train. ""The police started stopping the returning migrants at the railway station and sending them for checkups to the hospital. They were stopping people in a random manner. Those who well dressed and seemed like belonged to an upper class and dominant caste were not singled out. The others like me were stopped and sent to the hospital,"" he said. After his checkup, Kumar was sent home and ordered to self-quarantine for 14 days. He says health workers check on him every two days. He obliges because he understands the need to fight the virus, but every time they visit, it adds to his family's social stigma. ""They should come up with a better and more sensitive way of doing this,"" said Kumar. Lower caste Indians are not only more exposed to the coronavirus and face more stigmatization, but they're also being left out of government subsidies. On March 26, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that all healthcare workers would be covered by health insurance for three months, and that sanitarian workers would receive special insurance cover. The Rs 50 lakh ($66,000) measure was part of the government's $22.5 billion stimulus package. But to claim it, workers need an employment ID card validating their status as sanitation workers. Many sanitation workers don't have that. According to the Dalit Bahujan Resource Centre, 22% of sanitation workers, manual scavengers and waste pickers did not have the 12-digit, biometric national identification number and 33% did not possess ration cards to get subsidized food through the public distribution system. The unique national identification number is required to access many government schemes including getting subsidies and direct cash transfers, and health insurance under the Prime Minister's health project, as well as to open a bank account. ""It has been seen that most Dalits and Adivasis, find it difficult to get these government ID cards ... or ration cards. Either the information doesn't reach them, or the enrollment camps to get biometric IDs are never set up in their villages and mostly they are asked to pay huge bribes to get these IDs made,"" said Alladi Devakumar, executive secretary of Dalit Bahujan Resource Centre. Many sanitation workers who work as informal labor don't even have employment IDs. Salvi says she tried to approach the dean of the hospital where she works to ask for an employment identity card that would enable her to claim health insurance benefits and board the few buses that are running for essential service workers in Mumbai during the lockdown. Without the ID card, she cannot get on the bus and has to walk 90 minutes each way to work. But when she approached the office, she says the Dean shouted for security. ""She threatened me and said don't you dare come inside and called the guard to take me away. She thinks we are trash and now she has more reason to treat us like trash,"" says Salvi. CNN contacted the Dean but she declined to comment. Estheramma lives with her husband and two children in a dump yard, five kilometers away from the densely populated city of Guntur in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. She's an Adivasi waste picker and makes a living by collecting the waste from dumps, segregating the waste and selling it. She and her community live segregated on the dump. There is no ration shop nearby nor are there any health care facilities close to her. Like many other Dalits and Adivasis, Estheramma doesn't have an active bank account or a national ID card -- the two basic instruments needed to access direct cash transfers by the government. Without this she won't be able to claim the Rs 500 ($7) offered each month for the next three months to women, who are bank account holders registered under the government's financial inclusion program. ""There are people, especially Dalits and Adivasis who don't have accounts, then there are those who have accounts but are not able to operate them because the control of it is with someone else, either their upper caste literate landlord or the ration shopkeeper,"" says P. Sainath founding editor of People's Archive of Rural India, a digital journalism platform that archives stories from rural India. Since many bank accounts are tied to mobile phone accounts, local shopkeepers help many illiterate Dalits and Adivasis carryout their bank transactions. ""Sometimes, the bank accounts are automatically opened when someone buys a mobile connection and the person is not even aware that this bank account exists. And according to the government, all the direct cash transfers come to the newest bank account of the beneficiary, so at times they have no clue that they have received money,"" adds Sainath. Estheramma has a ration card and is eligible to receive the government benefit of 5 kg wheat or rice and 1 kg of preferred pulses for free for the next three months, but she said she can't go to the ration shop because it's run by shopkeepers of dominant castes who are not letting her come in, citing Covid-19. She says she's living on small food packets distributed by charities. ""The relief package should not be centralized or linked to biometric IDs like Aadhar,"" said economist Jayati Ghosh, Chairperson of the Center for Economic Studies and Planning at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. ""This will leave many out of the relief. This has to be done through state governments where they hand over these benefits through other beneficiary accounts of employment and food security."" More than 11,900 have been infected with the coronavirus in India and more than 390 people have died, according to the latest numbers from the John Hopkins University. It's a staggeringly small number in a nation of 1.3 billion people. The Indian government is expected to extend the nationwide lockdown beyond May 3, but it is still too early to gauge the final impact on the country's poorest. People like Polamma, Salvi and Kumar hope they'll be offered greater protection, but it hasn't come yet. After two weeks of lockdown, Polamma was finally able to access the grocery store after the police interfered at the request of Dalit activists. But she said no health workers were visiting her community to check on pregnant and lactating mothers. Salvi takes a painkiller every day and walks to the hospital to clean and do her job with no protective gear. And Kumar and his family are staying indoors to comply with the lockdown order -- and to avoid abuse. ""Every time I step out, people start shouting 'corona, corona,'"" he said. ""Earlier they would walk at a distance because I am a Dalit, but now they call me the disease itself.""

In a statement, Mayawati has urged UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to intervene in the matter and ensure action against the accused MP. The BJP MP Subrat Pathak, accompanied by 20 to 25 men, had allegedly broken into the house of the tehsildar, Arvind Kumar, on Monday and had assaulted him over the distribution of ration to people mentioned in a list sent by him. Mayawati said, ""The incident from Kannauj where an honest Dalit tehsildar was beaten by a BJP MP is shameful. What is more concerning is that he is still roaming scot-free instead of going to jail."" Demanding that Adityanath look into the matter, she wrote that recurrence of such incidents must be stopped and Dalits should not be attacked in this manner. ""Stern action is needed against the MP. This is what the BSP demands,"" she stated. A case has been registered against Pathak and 25 unidentified men, and around 10 vehicles have been seized from the site of the assault. The tehsildar had earlier said that he had explained to the MP over the phone that other senior officials were looking into the distribution of ration to people mentioned in his list. However, despite the explanation, the lawmaker abused and threatened him. Pathak's supporters have denied the incident, saying that they had gone only to discuss some development projects with Kumar. A report in the matter has been filed with the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police.","IND","dalit",1,1,NA,NA

A 23-year-old youth allegedly refused to eat food prepared by a Dalit cook. The youth, staying in quarantine refused to consume anything touched by the Dalit cook. The 23-year-old youth was identified as Dinesh Chandra Milkani. The accused was booked after the pradhan of Bhumka village filed a complaint against him. Dinesh, his nephew and three other persons have been staying in quarantine at a government primary school in Bhumka village since May 15. The cook was identified as Bhawani Devi. Bhawani Devi is a member of the Dalit community. Devi had been preparing meals for all the persons in quarantine. On May 15, she prepared food for all the quarantined persons. While on one side, all the people ate the food, Dinesh refused to consume it. Dinesh allegedly said that his food will come from home. Initially, Devi did not feel discriminated against. However, Devi learned the reality when Dinesh refused to drink water touched by her. When village pradhan Mukesh Chandra Baudhh learned about Dinesh's behaviour, he confronted the 23-year-old youth. Mukesh told The Times of India, ""Milkani said that his food will be delivered by his family. But, when we asked him to drink water touched by Devi, he refused again. "" Dinesh said that the incident is a case of caste discrimination, therefore, he took the decision of filing a complaint with the authorities. On being asked about the incident, Dinesh said that he refused to eat food as he always eats home-cooked food. He denied the allegations made against him. Dinesh claimed that he does not eat food prepared by other persons as he gets possessed by the deity. The 23-year-old youth has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the SC/ST Act.

Despite the country's multiculturalism, minority groups in Nepal тАФ known as Dalits or untouchables тАФ are often subjected to various forms of discrimination, which ranges from hate speech and abuse to rape and murder. Most recently, on May 24, two Dalit boys, Nawaraj Bishwakarama (BK) and Tika Ram Sunar, were found dead on the banks of the Bheri river in the Jajarkot district of Southern Nepal. Three other bodies of Ganesh Budha, Sandip BK and Lokendra Sunar were found later and another youngster, Govinda Shahi is still missing. An inter-caste love relationship was deemed to be the major reason for their tragic deaths. Nawaraj, a 21-year-old from Jajarkot who loved playing sports and wanted to join the police force, was born into a Dalit family. He fell in love with Sushma Malla, an upper-caste, 17-year-old girl. Once her family learned about their relationship, Nawaraj and his family received frequent warnings to keep away from her, and on one occasion, he was reported to the police. Sushma's family wanted to marry her off with someone from her own caste, so she reportedly asked Nawaraj to rescue her before they did. On the night of May 23, Nawaraj тАФ accompanied by 18 friends тАФ headed to Sushma's village of Soti, in the Rukum district, so that the two could elope. Upon their arrival, they were chased, stoned and beaten. In an attempt to save themselves, some of them jumped into the nearby river and managed to escape, but Nawaraj and five of his friends didnтАЩt survive the fall. Five bodies have been recovered so far, one still missing, and other members of the group were handed over to the police and were released later. One survivor told to media: Nawaraj was badly beaten up by the crowd. All his body parts, including his head, were seriously injured. He wasn't able to move and he was thrown into the river, he was not in a condition to even swim [so he] could survive. After the incident, police arrested Dambar Bahadur Malla, Sushma's father and ward chair of the local municipality, along with fifteen others in connection with the incident. Various human rights organisations and Dalit leaders have been pressuring the government to take immediate action on the case and provide justice to the victimsтАЩ families:  Although protests and discussions are ongoing in different parts of the country, many fear that this case will soon be forgotten, like so many others in the past.

It is heartbreaking to hear the statements of two friends who ran away with Nawaraj BK, who escaped from the crowd [in order] to save their own lives. After listening to his friends, it will not be difficult to understand that Nawaraj was killed because he was a Dalit. The lives of Nawaraj and his friends will not be returned by any logic/gossip. Despite laws to the contrary, caste-based discrimination is a festering sore in Nepalese society, as Dalits face continuous social prejudice and violence. On May 23, 2020, one day after a 12-year-old Dalit girl from the western Rupandehi district was forced to marry her upper-caste rapist, she was found hanging from a tree. Preliminary police investigations suggest that she had been raped and murdered. Every year in Nepal, many cases of inter-caste marriage are reported. In 2016, for example, 18-year-old Ajit Mijar married his upper-caste girlfriend Kalpana Parajuli. Five days later, his body was found hanging. By the time his family arrived on the scene, the police had already buried him, and тАФ without any investigation тАФ declared his death a suicide. According to the Article 18 of Nepal's Constitution, caste-based discrimination is criminalised тАФ but while the country announced itself as an untouchability-free nation in 2006, the Act only came into effect in 2011 and is not enforced. Most cases of caste-based discrimination are swept under the carpet, the police often fail to investigate reports of violence against Dalits, and perpetrators often go unreported or unpunished.

Entrepreneur Shiwani Neupane challenged the media not to shun their responsibility: I hope the Nepali media will continue to follow on the story of lynching of innocent Dalit boys in Nepal till justice is served. There is no space for impunity and that should be clear to everyone. I beg the media to not set this aside and move to the next news cycle. Please. тАФ Shiwani Neupane (@ShiwaniNeupane) May 30, 2020 Dalits remain one of the most underprivileged groups in Nepal, prompting the successful social entrepreneur and human rights activist Bishnu Maya Pariyar, who came from a low-caste family, to return to Nepal and produce a documentary, тАЬUntouchableтАЭ, on the discrimination that she faced growing up:  The caste system is categorised in a hierarchical arrangement, with Brahmins (priests) at the top, followed by Kshatriya (warriors and princes), Vaishya (farmers and artisans), and Shudra (shoemakers, tailors, metal workers, and servants). A fifth element varna categorises those deemed to be entirely outside its scope, including tribal people and untouchables such as Dalits. According to a comprehensive 2011 census report, Dalits made up 13.6 per cent of the total population (approximately 3.6 million people), but some researchers estimate that the number could be more. The census is conducted every 10 years in Nepal; the government is currently preparing for new census data collection. The caste system has played an influential role in NepalтАЩs social, economic, and political landscape. Most higher caste people are in positions of leadership, while Dalits are held back economically, socially, culturally and politically. In some parts of Nepal, Dalits are still not allowed to use public taps, temples, or shops. Though such incidents тАФ which range from social exclusion to murder тАФ are still prevalent nationwide, they are usually felt most strongly in conservative regions like Western Nepal, although the cities exhibit the underlying prejudice in subtler ways.

A minor Dalit girl kidnapped from West Bengal on the pretext of marriage and brought to New Delhi in March, was about to be sold to a trafficker in Rajasthan, but the ongoing lockdown saved her. The girl was rescued in April in a joint operation by the national child commission, Delhi police and a Delhi-based non-government organisation (NGO). The team laid a trap for the kidnapper by posing as citizen volunteers distributing free ration. The girl is currently staying at a womenтАЩs shelter and would be taken to her parents after the lockdown ends. The accused, Mohammad Salauddin, was arrested but granted bail. HereтАЩs the story of her kidnapping, the dramatic rescue operation and the prompt bail, owing to police negligence: The girl goes missing The girlтАЩs father Kamal Mondal (name changed, surname retained) lives in a village in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. He told this correspondent over phone that on the early morning of 29 February, the family found the girl was not in her bed. They looked around, but did not find her. Later in the day, they reached out to her friends and classmates. A name, Mohammad Salauddin, emerged in the conversations. тАЬI could not believe my girl was seeing someone. She had just appeared for her Class 10 exams. I used to pick her up from school every day. Even for her tuition classes, I would drop her and pick her up. I fail to understand where she even met him,тАЭ he told this correspondent. Kamal, who belongs to the Poundra community, which is a scheduled caste, said that the village has Muslims in majority and Hindu families usually accompany their girls outside homes. Kamal has two daughters; the one who was kidnapped is 16 while the other is aged 11. On his complaint, a first information report (number 592/2020) was registered at Barauipur police station on 2 March. When Kamal searched for the girlтАЩs documents to produce her age proof, he found that her Class 10 admit card, Aadhaar card, birth certificate and her bank passbook were missing. While Kamal says he mentioned SalauddinтАЩs name to the police, the statement in the FIR makes no mention of his name. The police only invoked IPC 363 (kidnapping). The accused calls the girlтАЩs family Kamal says that after about a week, he received a call from Salauddin, who he had never spoken to before. Kamal shared an audio recording of the conversation with this correspondent. A brief transcript (as translated from Bengali) is given below: Kamal: Both of you should return now Salauddin: Withdraw the case that you have filed and I will promptly come back Father: Is it that easy? Salauddin: Samaresh (who is implied to be a local cop) is asking me to surrender along with the girl but she is not willing to do so. I am a Muslim and I swear on Allah that I will never give her any troubles The father again asks the boy to return. Salauddin: Everyone is advising me not to return; many cops live in my locality and they too are saying the same thing Father: Cops are telling you not to bring her back? Salauddin: They are advising me to bring her back after a few months Later in the conversation, Salauddin revealed that all he wanted to know was the case number so his lawyer could file for bail. Kamal refused to give it. Kamal tells this correspondent, тАЬThis relationship is unacceptable to me as the man is Muslim. Moreover, when I inquired about him, I was told he is heavily into weed and has no job. I canтАЩt ruin my daughterтАЩs life.тАЭ тАЬIf he really loved my daughter, he should have come to me first. She is just a child. His intentions are not good,тАЭ he says. Kamal passed on the phone number to the police, but it was constantly switched off. Weeks passed and Kamal helplessly waited for the police to bring his daughter back. In the beginning of April, he received a call from her in the afternoon. She had called from an unknown number. тАЬAll she said was that she was trapped and wanted to come back home. She said she was in Delhi, but did not know her location,тАЭ Kamal says. He gave the phone number to the local police. Cops reach kidnapper on pretext of food distribution By that time, a nationwide lockdown had come into effect, and inter-state travel was prohibited. An NGO in Delhi, Mission Mukti Foundation, received a tip-off from a cop in West Bengal. The NGO took the case to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The commission directed the Delhi police to probe. Through the number, the girlтАЩs location was traced to Khajuri Khas. Khajuri Khas is one of the areas in northeast Delhi hit by communal violence that broke out between 23 and 25 February. It was the same area where murdered Intelligence Bureau employee Ankit Sharma lived. Virendra Kumar Singh, director of the NGO, told this correspondent that the police gave him two phone numbers тАФ of families living in the colony where the girl had been kept. The police told him that she was brought to Delhi on 21 March тАФ a day before тАШjanta curfewтАЩ. Singh then called up the two numbers. He told the men who answered the calls that the NGO would carry out a food distribution drive in the area within two days and they must come at a given spot to collect it. This correspondent has recordings of those conversations. One of the men, Mohammad Aqib (name changed), is heard telling Virendra that the colony has Gujjar-owned houses that have been rented to Muslims, and no ration distribution drive is being carried out in the area. On 21 April, a team comprising NCPCR officials, cops from Khajuri Khas police station and a few volunteers of the NGO reached the spot. When the two families reached the spot, the team questioned them about the girl in confinement in their colony. тАЬFor a long time, they kept denying any knowledge of it. Eventually, they agreed to speak on the condition that their name would feature nowhere in the police case,тАЭ an NCPCR official said. A woman took the team inside the lane and pointed at the house; the team raided it and detained both the girl and Salauddin. The accused gets bail, thanks to police negligence Virendra Singh told this correspondent that in the presence of cops and NCPCR officials at the police station, the girl said that Salauddin was planning to sell her to someone in Rajasthan. тАЬShe said it in front of all officials. If it werenтАЩt for lockdown, she would have been trafficked to Rajasthan by March end,тАЭ Singh said. An NCPCR member, who was part of the team, confirmed it. Asked about the girlтАЩs medical report and statement to the magistrate, the member said they have not received information from the police yet. While one wonders what fate the girl could have met if the accusedтАЩs plan to traffic her had succeeded, the case as it stands is that the accused is out on bail. тАЬThis happened because the Delhi police failed to present the copy of the FIR, that was registered at West Bengal, to the court,тАЭ Priyank Kanoongo, chairman of the child commisison, told this correspondent. тАЬThe accused got a prompt bail. The FIR itself had weak charges. The police should have invoked POCSO and added section 370 at the time of filing it,тАЭ he said. IPC 370 is for trafficking of minors; the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, has stringent sections for sexual assault on minors. Kanoongo said that it is this inter-state confusion that is failing to put a stop at trafficking тАФ especially that of minor girls. тАЬUnless trafficking is handled by a central agency, such as the CBI, we cannot tackle it,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhen CBI was formed, trafficking was one of its focus areas. Now, state governments have limited their powers in states, and trafficking has gone up,тАЭ he said. The girlтАЩs family awaits their daughter Kamal Mondal said that he has managed to talk to his daughter a couple of times since her rescue. As he awaits her, he says тАШthe girlтАЩs life has been ruinedтАЩ. When told that his daughter could resume studies and put the incident behind, Kamal says, тАЬThe entire village knows about the case. She has no reputation left. We have no reputation left. We can no longer go out with our heads high.тАЭ Virendra Singh told this correspondent that his organisation would counsel the girl and her family. Swati Goel Sharma is a senior editor at Swarajya.

A 19-year-old Dalit boy and two of his friends were killed allegedly by the family members of an upper caste girl he wanted to marry in western Nepal. The issue was raised in Nepal's parliament on Tuesday after which the government formed a five-member probe committee led by the Joint Secretary of the Home Ministry to investigate the incident. The murders took place on Saturday night when the boy, Nabaraj Bika, a resident of Jajarkot district, along with his 18 relatives and friends had gone to the house of his 17-year-old girlfriend, Sushma Malla, who was supposed to get married to another man the next day. Nabaraj belonged to a lower caste while the girl belongs to a higher Chhetriya caste. The girl's parents were against her marriage. As Nabaraj reached the girl's house, her mother called the villagers and relatives who chased the boy and his accomplices, police said. They attacked the boy's group with weapons and stones in which the boy and two others died on the spot and five others sustained injuries.  Three others, who escaped after jumping into a nearby river to save their life, are missing. Police have arrested 12 people, including a ward chairman, for their alleged involvement in the incident. The matter was raised by many parliament members in the House of Representatives on Tuesday and the lawmakers demanded stern action against the culprits. The boy's family members have declined to receive his body unless action is taken against the attackers. ""My son had to die just because he was from a Dalit family. We will not receive the bodies unless the culprits face legal action,"" said the boy's father.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA
"258",2457,"https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/conversions-to-hinduism-case-for-recognising-dalit-muslims","Conversions to Hinduism & the Case for Recognising Dalit Muslims","While Hindu, Sikh & Buddhist Scheduled Castes are entitled to reservation under law, Dalit Muslims arenтАЩt recognised The recent conversion to Hinduism of almost 250 people part of an estimated 30-40 Muslim families in Haryana's Hisar district, is at first glance related to systemic stigmatisation of Muslims in the wake of the Tablighi Jamaat incident. But at the deeper level, the incident is connected to the long-standing and unaddressed plight of those at the lowest level of the Muslim social pyramid. Almost a fortnight prior to this incident in Bithmara village of Uklana block of Hisar, there had been another, albeit smaller, occurrence of Muslim families converting to Hinduism. In this incident in Danoda Kalan village in Jind district, all members of the families of six brothers converted to Hinduism. One of the brothers, when asked, regarding the immediate provocation, asserted that the ""Tablighi Jamaat episode pained them and they decided to convert for good. 'We are feeling greatly relieved after embracing Hinduism,' he said."" This decision was not endorsed by the majority of Muslims in the Jind village and they remain loyal to their faith. Although the village has a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sarpanch, he was quoted by the media as saying that Muslims were under no pressure. The absence of comprehensive reportage makes it difficult to conclude if this claim is true or not. The families that converted in the two villages in Jind and Hisar are from the Doom community and are called Mirasi Muslims. They are known as folk singers and play folk musical instruments like the Rabaab. They are spread across Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan. In the initial years, before his fame spread far and wide, Guru Nanak was always accompanied by a person called Bhai Mardana, a Mirasi Muslim who played the instrument while Nanak recited hymns. This is considered the beginning of the Sikh Rababi or Kirtanee tradition of singing Shabad Kirtan. At a theatre festival in February 2020 in Jammu, a play, Bhanwarya Kallet, was performed and it was directed by theatre artist Sikandar Khan, of Mirasi descent. The play depicts the distressful life of community members and Khan is on record saying that due to societal pressure, he initially disowned his Mirasi identity, but later dug deeper into the community's ancestry. Like many communities in India, the Mirasis have a dual, even triple, religious identity. As a result, Mirasis can be Hindus, Muslims, and even Sikhs. There is the interesting case of Punjabi folk singer Mohammad Sadique who was elected member of Lok Sabha in May 2019 from the Faridkot constituency reserved for Scheduled Castes. A Mirasi and also member of the Doom caste, he was born in a non-practising Muslim family and at a certain point in his life, he veered towards Sikhism, and converted to the faith. He successfully contested for the Assembly in 2012 but his election was challenged in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on grounds that being a Muslim, he was not eligible to fight elections from a reserved constituency. He was unseated by the HC but on appeal in the Supreme Court, he was reinstated as MLA. The apex court had observed that тАЬa person can change his religion or faith, but not the caste to which he belongs to, as caste has linkage to birth.тАЭ In the Haryana villages where the conversions have taken place, there are several other communities which are noted for dual or multiple religious identities. Communities like Teli and Lohar like the Mirasi, too have people who are either Hindus or Muslims. In recent years, anecdotal evidence suggests there have been conversions to Hinduism because of two factors. First, there has been increasing campaign against Muslims as a result of which these rural communities where there was previously no polarisation on religious lines, too, have got fractured. The second important reason is that while Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist Scheduled Castes are entitled to avail of reservations under law, Dalit Muslims are not recognised. Although this demand has been listed for long and the problem of this community was dealt at length by the Sachar Commission, Dalit Muslims have not been extended reservations because of fear of backlash from Hindu SCs who will have to share the quota with Muslim Dalits. Notably, when neo-Buddhists were brought under this law and reservations were extended for them in 1990, there was no protest. Even earlier, in 1956 when ""Article 341 was amended to extend the same benefits that Hindu Dalits enjoy to Sikh Dalits,"" there had been no objection. The Sachar Committee concluded that ""there is a strong case for according Scheduled Caste status to Dalit Muslims and Christians."" Some Muslim communities have been included in the OBC list, but this does not benefit the weakest among Muslims. The Sachar Committee argued: ""In refusing SC status to Dalit Muslims and Christians the State violates Articles 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution that guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion."" The Post-Sachar Evaluation Committee, headed by Prof Amitabh Kundu, presented its final report to Dr Najma Heptullah, the then Union Minister for Minority Affairs, in October 2014 after the Modi government had assumed office. It recommended that Dalit Muslims who were part of the OBC list should be taken out and ""incorporated in the SC list."" Furthermore, it made a case for some Muslim artisanal communities to be given Most Backward Castes sub-category status within the OBC list. Mass conversion of Muslims is considered as the 'final solution' to India's religious plurality and continued existence of minorities. Granting same rights and privileges to Dalit Muslims (and Dalit Christians) as being given to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists Scheduled Castes would halt the process of conversions like those witnessed in the two Haryana villages. Denial of these rights is seen as an important part of the overall Hindutva strategy. But given the significant presence of Muslims in India, it would be wiser now to reach out to the community and recognise social stratification in Muslims society. After having run a polarising campaign for three decades, it is time, especially in the wake of new challenges facing India where reviving the economy will be most vital for national reconstruction, to allow social harmony to flourish. India is seeking to woo companies intending to leave China in the wake of the pandemic. High levels of social strife and a polarised polity perpetually on the brink of eruption will stick out like a sore thumb in risk-evaluations that potential investors will conduct. It would be wise for the ruling regime to instruct cadre to actively discourage mass or even limited conversions as it may alarm the global community. After the Gulf backlash, this is another risk that is best avoided. (The writer is an author and journalist based in Delhi.

The Telangana police on Friday arrested four people for brutally assaulting an 18-year-old young Dalit man, and forcing him to drink urine. The man was attacked for reportedly being in a relationship with a woman from the Goud community, which is categorized as a Backward Caste. The horrific crime took place in Ponkal village in Mancherial district. Police said that the accused--Muthyam Sai, Garipetti Harish Goud, Patkut Prashanth and Azmath Khan-- remained elusive. After receiving inputs that the accused were trying to flee on motorcycles, the accused were detained near Dharmaram point in Peddapalle district at around 7.50 am, police said. Following the investigation, the accused confessed to the crime, Mancherial police said. Subsequently they were produced before the court. The accused were arrested under the SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and were also charged under IPC section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 290 (Punishment for public nuisance) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Sampath reviews Memoirs of a Dalit Communist: The Many Worlds of R.B. More, edited by Anupama Rao","Ramchandra Babaji More is not a big name in IndiaтАЩs progressive circles. A Dalit organiser who was close to B.R. Ambedkar, he didnтАЩt get his due in the history of Dalit politics. A pioneering mobiliser for the Communist Party in Maharashtra, he didnтАЩt get his due in the history of the Indian Left either. Needless to say, he also doesnтАЩt figure prominently in the savarna-dominated pantheon of IndiaтАЩs freedom fighters and social reformers. Plugging a gap This volume, which combines MoreтАЩs unfinished autobiography with his son SatyendraтАЩs biography of his father, is a much needed corrective. It plugs a gap in the histories of both Dalit politics and Indian communism. Translated from Marathi by Wandana Sonalkar, it has a scholarly introduction by historian Anupama Rao that contextualises MoreтАЩs life and work against the backdrop of Dalit movements and trade unionism in early 20th century Maharashtra. MoreтАЩs relative obscurity, in itself, is a potent signifier тАФ of a revolutionary whose courage and dedication dwarfed that of the organisations he served. Born in a Mahar family in 1903 in Ladawali, a village in MaharashtraтАЩs Raigad district, MoreтАЩs political activism began early. At the age of 11, when denied admission to Mahad high school despite winning a scholarship, he pens a letter to a local newspaper, demanding that the schoolтАЩs grant be stopped. His letter shames, and scares, the school into giving him admission, striking a blow against untouchability that reverberated throughout the Konkan. Subsequently, More, still a school boy, helps set up a tea stall in Mahad that becomes a meeting point for тАШUntouchablesтАЩ to gather and discuss social issues. Since he knew English, he also becomes a letter-writer for тАШUntouchablesтАЩ and poor savarnas. In PhuleтАЩs steps MoreтАЩs political work in the Mahad region, building on the foundation laid by Jyotirao Phule and others, laid the groundwork for the historic Mahad Satyagraha in 1927. In 1930, just as the independent Dalit movement was gathering steam, More informs Ambedkar of his decision to officially join the Communist Party. AmbedkarтАЩs response is priceless. This is how Satyendra describes the exchange: тАЬSeeing MoreтАЩs courage and honesty, he [Ambedkar] said, тАШI am overwhelmed by your sincerity and dedication.... I wonder whether the Communist Party in India, which belongs to Brahmins, will appreciate your dedication and honesty?тАЩтАЭ As an organic intellectual, More sought to bridge the divide between class struggle and identity politics. In 1953, he prepared a note on тАЩUntouchability and the Caste QuestionтАЩ and sent it to the party leadership. The note (included in this volume) is a clear-eyed analysis of the class-caste conundrum that resonates six decades after it was written. More states what should have been obvious to the Party тАФ that caste consciousness is the biggest hindrance to class consciousness тАФ and calls for prioritising the fight against caste. тАЬThe caste system is a hideous form of hypocrisy of which a revolutionary party like the Communist Party must take cognisance and its hideousness must be thoroughly and unhesitatingly exposed,тАЭ reads the note. The LeftтАЩs record in independent India suggests, however, that the Party leadership didnтАЩt quite embrace тАШthe More lineтАЩ. How did More fare on the other side of the divide тАФ in Dalit politics? While he did manage to attract a host of Dalit activists into the Communist fold, he wasnтАЩt as successful in dissolving the distrust between Communists and the independent Dalit movement. Not only has this distrust persisted to the present day, it has developed into a festering fault line even amongst Dalit groups. MoreтАЩs personal life was unbelievably hard. His family paid a terrible price for his utter dedication to party work. His sense of dignity prevented him from taking even the normal share of monetary help from the party. In the end, one is left wondering, as Ambedkar did: will the Left and the Dalit movements warm up to his lifeтАЩs work? Perhaps the time has finally come.

RAJASTHAN: In Rajasthan, which is one of the worst five states in India when it comes to atrocities against Dalits, Suman Devathiya, a senior Dalit rights activist has emerged as a leader overcoming not only the entrenched casteism in the state but deep-seated patriarchy as well. Suman is a part of Dalit Women Fight, a movement led by Dalit women to strengthen their voices for justice. Commenting on the importance of Dalit History Month, Suman says that it is very important to know oneтАЩs correct history. тАЬIn the mainstream, there is no Dalit history. There are youth who are collecting Dalit history. Maybe our future generation will benefit from our small contributions,тАЭ she told TwoCircles.net. The Twitter handle of Dalit Women Fight is full of inspirational stories of Dalit women. Talking about the social media campaign for Dalit History Month Suman says that their objective was to acknowledge and take inspiration from the contributions of Dalit sisters and mothers who have contributed positively towards the society. Dalit History Month was launched in 2013 by Sanghapali Aruna and Thenmozhi Soundararajan. The idea was to celebrate Dalit contribution to history and the month of April was dedicated for this. Incidentally, April is a significant month among Dalits as two great Dalit leaders тАУ Dr BR Ambedkar and Jyotirao Phule were born in April. Dalit History Month is dedicated to bringing out stories from marginalized communities and acknowledge their experiences to change the existing dominant narratives. Suman says she feels happy that there are many great personalities from the Dalit community who have done inspiring work. тАЬWhy canтАЩt we do the same. The sharing of these stories gives us motivation and we feel strong,тАЭ she says. Suman grew up in a humble family in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan. She was married at the age of 15, while still being in 10th standard. Despite being married at an early age, Suman had only one thing in mind: to complete her education. Determined, she completed her Bachelors in Arts from Rajasthan University. Soon after graduation, Suman started working for the education of girls in the backward regions of Rajasthan. Suman is proud of her education, which she completed against all odds. According to Suman, Dalit women in Rajasthan are not able to attain education. тАЬCasteism and patriarchy are the major obstacles in the path of Dalit women to attain education. The economic backwardness of the Dalit community is another barrier for Dalit women,тАЭ Suman says. As a Dalit rights activist, she has become an agent for the advocacy of the Dalit community. Over the years, Suman has been instrumental in bringing forth the issues of Dalit women in Rajasthan before the government. Suman attributes her work to the larger Dalit movement in the country. тАЬWhen I got involved with this movement I got to know about the history of our forefathers. If there was no movement, I would never have known about our history. As I am a part of this movement, I have the opportunity to help my fellow sisters,тАЭ she says. In Rajasthan, Suman is regarded and known as one of the prominent Dalit women leaders. In her 17 years of working for Dalit rights, she has worked with multiple organizations. An abiding interest for her has been her close work with women survivors of domestic abuse and rape survivors. тАЬThere have been many women who lost hope and suffered from low morale. We gave them confidence and we helped them,тАЭ she says. Suman has also been taking up Dalit women issues which are ignored by the mainstream feminist movements and also by the larger Dalit movement. As part of these efforts, Suman has independently led Dalit Women self-respect marches across more than 20 districts of Rajasthan. The fight against casteism and patriarchy has not been without challenges. тАЬIn my working experience, I have observed that casteism or patriarchy work together. Patriarchy is not ready to accept a womanтАЩs leadership. And if you look at Rajasthan, it is because of patriarchy and casteism that we have not seen any women leadership,тАЭ she says. Suman says that every time she had to fight for her rights as a Dalit woman she looked up to Ambedkar for moral support and strength. тАЬWe Dalit women have no one other than Ambedkar. He is the only one we look up to. When we read him we feel that safe space,тАЭ she says. Suman believes that Ambedkar is not only a Dalit leader but he also has a feminist viewpoint. While in school, Suman would read very little about Ambedkar or the Constitution. тАЬIt is only after connecting with Dalit movements that I came to know about Dalit personalities,тАЭ she says. At home either, Suman didnтАЩt receive any education about the great Dalit personalities. She ascribes this to lack of education and awareness among the older generation. тАЬThese personalities always inspire me as my forefathers,тАЭ says Suman, who is now conscious and aware of her history. Other than Ambedkar, Suman is inspired by Savitribai Phule, IndiaтАЩs first social reformer who established a school for girl children. тАЬYou must read Savitribai Phule and how she gave importance to education and Jyotiba Phule supported her,тАЭ she says. Suman believes that there is a lack of consciousness and knowledge of Dalit history in the remote villages of Rajasthan. тАЬThe women in the remote areas are not formally educated or aware of the Dalit movement,тАЭ she says. Suman has been working relentlessly to change this scenario. She does this by sharing her knowledge with them. She has become a link to disseminate the Dalit history among women who are not conscious or aware of their rights. тАЬI think when I have learned so much, I should bring this knowledge to the larger Dalit community and I take pride in doing it,тАЭ she says. Her journey has not been smooth. During difficult times, Suman says, тАЬit was my mother who remained by inspiration and gave me strength.тАЭ тАЬWe Dalit women have each other only. We have to be there for each other and support each other,тАЭ she says.window.onload = function() {var adsPercent = 1;if(Math.random() <= adsPercent) {var script = document.createElement(""script"");script.src = ""https://pagead2.goodlessyndication.com/js/adsbygoogle.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(script); } };","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

Prime Minister Modi warned in his televised address that people should be ready for тАЬbold reformsтАЭ. BJP-led state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have already either scrapped or rendered labour laws totally ineffective. The BJP government has cunningly chosen this critical period of medical emergency to push through its anti-people measures under the garb of COVID-19. The anti-worker measures would have been confronted with massive resistance from workers but for the lockdown and the Epidemics and Disaster Management Act in force.  A тАЬself-reliant IndiaтАЭ cannot be built on foreign capital тАУ certainly not by scrapping labour laws in a bid to attract foreign capital. For Prime Minister Modi, self-reliance is only rhetoric and doesnтАЩt really mean self-reliance of the country and its people. He is pushing workers and toilers into slavery while making India subservient to imperialist powers. Early this year, while several countries were trying to rein in COVID-19, the government was busy orchestrating violence against anti-CAA, NRC, NPR protestors, particularly Muslims in Delhi. When the virus struck the country, the Tablighi Jamaat was blamed for the spread of the virus, thus portraying Muslims as its carriers. Now several of the Jamaat members have been arrested. The corporate communal government, true to its form, painted the Muslims as the enemy to conceal its own failures in fighting COVID-19. The first and primary victims of the unplanned and abrupt lockdown announced by Prime Minister Modi were the crores of migrant labourers. They were stranded all over the country without food, shelter or money. An overwhelming majority of migrant labourers are poor and hail from the most downtrodden social sections, mostly Dalits, other Backwards and Adivasis, on the lowest rungs of society. The government is now forcing the migrant labourers to work under semi-bonded conditions by slowing down evacuation тАУ reducing the number of trains to their home states and by increasing fares. A major section of frontline workers in the effort to contain the epidemic, particularly ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, Anganwadi workers, mid-day meal workers, and housekeeping and sanitation workers are offered only empty rhetoric тАУ they are not even paid minimum wages, let alone bonuses. Again, most of them are Dalits, Backwards and Adivasis. As the Modi government seeks to protect corporate monopoly capital, it is sacrificing the working class. It is hurriedly preparing to enforce anti-labour codes through backdoor methods, without any tripartite or bipartite discussions and by violating ILO (International Labour Organization) conventions, all in the name of coronavirus. Dearness allowance has been frozen for central government and PSU employees. The state governments and the private-sector industrial units have also followed suit. Mass retrenchments are being announced. The Uttar Pradesh government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has suspended application of all but a few ornamental state labour laws for three years. In fact, it was forced to withdraw a particular notification that sought to put in place a 12-hour workday. All inherent rights of workers earned through militant struggles and innumerable sacrifices and guaranteed by the Constitution тАУ 8-hour workdays, minimum wage, EmployeesтАЩ State Insurance, Provident Fund, gratuity, grievance redressal and conciliation mechanism of labour departments and labour courts, system of inspection, right to form union and recognition, regularization тАУ stand abrogated at one stroke. Migrants take the long walk to their home states; Prime Minister Narendra Modi with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe at a bullet train plant in Japan in 2016 The so-called тАШbalancedтАЩ changes in labour laws resorted to by the Madhya Pradesh government are no less brutal. It has offered a blanket exemption of application of crucial labour laws like the Industrial Disputes Act, Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act, and Factories Act. The conciliation machinery and inspection systems are being destroyed. Even private inspections are allowed. No labour law is applicable if companies employ less than 100 workers. Companies are assured of a licence in one day and are exempted from its renewal for 10 years. This could mean a repetition of Vizag-like gas leakages and other industrial accidents. тАЬProfit over peopleтАЭ is the overriding mantra in all these changes. Gujarat is also following suit and has begun by sanctioning a 12-hour workday. Even state governments led by the Congress and other opposition parties governments donтАЩt want to be left behind as evident in Rajasthan, Punjab and BJD-led Odisha. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are seriously debating possible pro-industrialist amendments to the existing applicable labour laws. Karnataka went to the extent of cancelling trains meant to take migrant workers to their home states on the advice of the industrial and construction lobby. Chief Minister Yediyurappa, acting on a petition by the employersтАЩ association, transferred his secretary of labour. Governments are becoming increasingly responsive to demands of industrialists while riding roughshod over workersтАЩ interests. Prime Minister Modi has declared a 20 lakh crore package to revive the economy. But it has nothing to offer for scores of migrant labourers walking hundreds of kilometres to reach their homes, even though the migrant workers are said to constitute 40 percent of the total workforce. Crores of unorganized workers and even regular workers in majority of cases have been flatly refused the lockdown wages assured by Modi. This has been true of not just the MSME sector but also the big companies. The proposed rural package has nothing to say about guaranteeing work or wages under NREGA. It only talks about extending support to rural infrastructure to help rich farmers and kulaks. Poor agricultural labourers are not at all in the picture. Rather, NREGA allocations have been progressively being reduced. Creating massive unemployment is the strategy of the government to provide cheap labour to the corporates and to protect and increase their profits. The central government claims that by increasing the workday from 8 to 12 hours companies can operate with 50-65 percent workforce and meet the тАШsocial distancingтАЩ requirements of reining in the epidemic. But this is nothing but a cunning strategy to secure the profits of corporate companies. By scrapping labour laws, the governments and the corporates hope to attract international capital from China, whose handling of the coronavirus epidemic has come under criticism. They do not understand that the capital also requires some regulation of working conditions to escape spontaneous outbursts of workers. Abrogation of labour rights and labour laws can only lead to anarchy, fuel dissent and intensify protests. In other words, the governments and the corporates are just daydreaming. Shankar V. is president, All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU). He has been associated with trade unions and working-class movements for more than 35 years The apathy of the union government towards the people in the margins during the lockdown imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus has been evident in both its inaction and actions тАУ The Bhupesh Baghel government of Chhattisgarh believes that there are at least 51 spots in the state associated with Ram and plans to spend Rs 10 crore on developing nine of them.

For a Dalit woman, even in this day and age, this is a question that unfortunately, gives her sleepless nights. There's no denying that Dalit women are 'twice-alienated'. First, because of their caste, and second, because of their gender. In public society, she is oppressed by her upper-caste employers and she returns home only to be oppressed by the man or men in her home. With nothing to claim as her own and always having to live at the mercy of others, her very being is ignored and her voice is silenced. So could a piece of land registered to her name really change things around? Dr P Vedhanayagi, a Dalit activist and agro-feminist certainly believes so. In fact, the link between property ownership and civic rights has been clear throughout history, even dating back to ancient Rome where you could vote only if you owned land. While the Indian government has made attempts and provisions for women to own land, it is easier said than done. For instance, many Dalit women are not even aware of these provisions, and even if they are, they need to depend on others (mostly, their oppressors) to get access to it. So, in 2004, Vedhanayagi decided to start a collective in Ranipet, Vellore to help Dalit women own their own land. She named it the Thendral (breeze, in Tamil) Movement. As part of this initiative, more than 50,000 individual women and their families have benefitted through various programmes, counseling sessions, campaigns, seminars, training workshops, legal counselling and support. Explaining the importance of their work, Vedhanayagi says, ""Ownership of the land, even if it is just a cent, empowers Dalit women. Land ownership was earlier possible only for men and Dalit men either lost or sold it or got cheated. History has seen how Dalits have lost land ownership and became landless, resulting in them becoming powerless and without rights. Men are less ambitious to empower women and let women have the ownership over the land. Thus, Dalit women have to face several challenges in winning this process. Owning land for a Dalit woman is a herculian task, but our struggle continues."" Thendral Movement has also been fighting for the central and state governments to amend the Land Acquisition Act. The activists are calling for ownership of all waste lands to be given to women. Vedhanayagi believes that not only will this empower them, it will also help in developing these waste lands as women will work harder, a concept she calls Agro-feminism. She explains further, ""After ownership of the land, women will not have to go to other factories to work. They would produce, distribute, disperse and develop the entire society from hamlet to hamlet, village to village, Panchayat to Panchayat. Her life and the the lives of everyone around her could change."" And it all begins with owning land.

"267",2560,"https://indianculturalforum.in/2020/05/13/dalit-literature-on-memory-or-death/","Dalit literature: On memory or death","TextтАФa clue to my memory and history Literature is a must for revolution. And if the revolution seeks to resurrect the тАЬhuman personalityтАЭ then literature is essential. The primary function of caste is to destroy the sense of humility; to make men so incapable of thinking beyond their caste that even violence against a person from another caste does not provoke them to take action to stop it. In fact, caste society, backed by mythological stories, its existence justified by Vedic-brahmanic religious texts, is akin to a crafty and violent PUBG game in which each characterтАЩs role has been pre-decided and breaking of whose rules culminates in a punishment that is violent, sadistic, unnatural and dehumanising. Brahmins are the creators and protectors of this ancient PUBG game called the caste system. After having played this unnatural, irrational and illogical game for centuries, the role assigned to each character has developed an abnormal social psychology. Coming out of this abnormality in such an ill-formed society, and to accept тАЬcommon senseтАЭ, is no less than a revolution. Also read | Ambedkar: Shakespeare and Other Literary Pursuits In 1956, Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in Nagpur, and half a million Mahars followed him too. Theirs was a declaration of war against irrationality and the abnormality of the caste system; the PUBG created by the brahmins. Six-and-a-half decades later, they are still fighting what is perhaps the longest non-violent battle in human history. Their battle has been made possible by the literature they have been producing ever since this war began. Making a gun or another weapon to fight a battle is evidently easy, but producing literature for it is a time-consuming, painstaking and emotionally rigorous act, especially when the oppressors have told the writers no history of their ancestors. Writers of such revolutions are entirely dependent on memory or the oral history of their community. Memory dies if it is not passed on to the next generation. Oral history is lost when it is not communicated to the generations that follow. In both circumstances, historical identity is lost. And it is this historical identity that dalits require, to own and to continue their resistance against a society that enslaved them for centuries. Even for me, this is only possible when the memory and history of my ancestors is converted into text. MemoryтАФthe abode of my history What is memory? Its textual definition says that it is a faculty of the mind that restores information. But how come some communities, or at least some people, have memories of their great-great-great-great grandparents and some of us do not even know the names of our father or mother or of our grandparents, nor have any other information about them? How come the few who have these memories of their past are proud of it, while most of us do not have it at all? In India, the function of memory has very different connotations when we speak about dalits (the ex-untouchable communities). I think it was some fifteen years back that my grandfather died. I do not remember the exact date or year. And on 3 May, my grandmother died. She was about 95 years old. But her voter identity card, though it does not mention the exact date or year of her birth, says that she was 61 years old in 1991. Now that both my grandparents are gone I simply cannot recall them because, as I mentioned earlier, there was no memory passed from them to me, nor was an oral history of anything communicated to me by them. This was not their fault. The hardships of life and circumstances are to blame. Excluding a few cases, this is the situation with most of us dalits. We simply do not have a bridge of communication that can lead us to the history of our families. Interestingly, in the absence of such family-community histories, sooner or later, we are enslaved, or found governed by those dominant (also oppressive) ideologies of state and society that are powerful. This is a realisation which is yet to come to most communities (castes) in India. But it had come, as early as in 1927, to the mahars (Buddhists since 1956) in Maharashtra and thus was laid the foundational brick for dalit literature. Also read | Ambedkar: A Spartan Warrior who Made Knowledge and Justice his Weapon In the beginning, they had nothing but a fractured oral history. In the brahmanical religious scriptures, the mahars were mentioned as despicable. But in their memory, and in their oral history, they were fighters; intelligent and cultured people. As Babasaheb Ambedkar argued, the mahars had been Buddhists for centuries. Soon, the stories, poems and songs produced by them attested to their claims on their oral history, and thus began the arrival of the mahar community into textual memory. This arrival was fresh and political. It had an objective: to deny the brahmanical version of history and memory and to convert oral history into textual form so that it would prevail for generations to come. Today, both my grandparents are gone. I can only make some sense of longing for them because of the literature written by a few among us. It is because of dalit literature that I can imagine the historical self of my grandparents and come to an understanding of their circumstances, struggle and survival. It is because of dalit literature that I can feel respect for their existence, even though I did not share intimate moments of communication with them, nor heard stories from them, nor was caressed by them. It is in these fractured memories and painful lives that dalit writers have found a sense of belonging and history. And it is in this textual memory that I find the abode of my history today. DeathтАФthe inability to be in text Non-dalits may find it unbelievable, but death for dalits is metaphorical. An тАЬuntouchableтАЭ never existed as a person worthy of respect from society or recognised as a mind. He was simply invisible, except when his labour was extracted, exploited and used for free. Thus it was not very difficult for dalits from a few generations ago to understand how it feels to remain invisible. This reality has not ceased to exist even today, although its forms vary. Not existing for others, not being recognised by others, is a condition of simply not being extant. It is in this sense that death is metaphorical for dalits. Yet, this is not a normal reality. It is an abnormal condition, an ecology, to use a broad term, that has been constructed by brahmins and all other castes who follow them. Also read | Dalit Women as Active Participants in Ambedkarite Movement This abnormality, too, was first understood by dalits in Maharashtra and dealt with by establishing a body of dalit literature. Those who simply did not exist in the eyes of caste Hindus and brahmins in society have arrived at the centre-stage of stories, histories and memories via dalit literature. Gradually, and surprisingly, their arrival in textual form is being recognised by the world and this community has been reborn in the imagination, both literary and historical, of the world. TextтАФas history and memoryтАФbeing the most effective tool to keep our sense for resistance against enslavement of any kind alive, proved to be a resurrection from social death for mahars (Buddhists) and a few other dalit castes in Maharashtra. Then, suffice to say that as long as the caste system will prevail, physical death for dalits will always remain metaphorical. Their actual death lies in an inability to be in text, or transform into a text as a story, memory and history. But before death, there is life. And here, dalit literature today proclaims their passionate existence, and passion for life. .jnews_6138da8730c08 { color : #000000; } .jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_light a, .jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark a { color : #000000; } .jnews_6138da8730c08 input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08 textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08 select,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark select { background-color : rgba(0,0,0,0.01); } .jnews_6138da8730c08 input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08 textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08 select,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark select { color : #000000; } .jeg_footer .jnews_6138da8730c08 input[type=""submit""], .jeg_footer .jnews_6138da8730c08 .btn, .jeg_footer .jnews_6138da8730c08 .button { background-color : #000000; } ┬й 2021 Indian Cultural Forum | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License Login to your account below    Fill the forms bellow to register    Please enter your username or email address to reset your password.

"271",2647,"https://www.hindujagruti.org/news/126136.html","They demand we worship Babasaheb, not Hindu Deities, says a Dalit family alleging attack by Bhim Army members","A Dalit family in BiharтАЩs Kishanganj district has accused the local Bhim Army unit of attacking them for their beliefs, desecrating a temple as they object to their reverence for Hindu deities and saffron flags. According to a report by Swarajya, a police case has been filed by both sides (the Bhim Army side and the temple side) in Kashganj police station. The first FIR was filed by a member of the Bhim Army. 27-year-old Deepchand Ravidas, in his statement to the police, said that around 3.30 pm on May 13, a group of men attacked him with a sword near a Shiva temple on Thakurbari road. The statement also says the group attacked his sister too when she came to his rescue. On the basis of his complaint, the Kashganj police booked 8 members, including members of the Dalit family namely, 55-year-old Gyani Ram and three of his four sons тАФ Santosh Ram, Shyam Sundar Ram and Birendra Ram. On the other side, 28-year-old Santosh Ram in his FIR alleged that on May 13 at around 4:30 pm a group of men entered the Shiva temple (thatтАЩs adjoining their house) and tried to desecrate it. The group entered the premises with iron rods, bricks and stones and demanded the temple be removed. They also tried to break the Shivling. The report by Swarajya says that when Santosh and his family objected, the group attacked them with a motive of murder. The statement read that the Bhim Army group attacked SantoshтАЩs father, brothers and sisters. Based on this statement, the police booked four named persons and other unidentified persons, under the same IPC sections as in the first FIR.  Birendra Ram, who has been named as accused in the FIR lodged by members of the Bhim Army rejected the charges imposed on him and his family memberтАЩs and recalled how he and his family were often mocked by the members of the Bhim Army for their belief in Hindu gods. тАЬWe are BJP voters. They donтАЩt like this. They constantly tell us to join their outfit. They demand we stop worshipping Hindu deities and worship only Babasaheb (Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar),тАЭ Birendra says. Birendra alleged that on May 10 a group entered the temple and told everyone to remove the saffron flag bearing an image of Bajrang Bali installed there. An old animosity culminated into violence recalls Birendra, whoтАЩs two brothers, Santosh and Guddu, are recovering in hospital. Birendra also says that once in the past, during a discussion the local Bhim Army members had insisted that the shivling be broken to show that тАЬI (Birendra) donтАЩt support any false gods. I grew really angry and left the discussion. I said that if that was the condition, I would never support his group again,тАЭ he recalls. Birendra furthers how on AmbedkarтАЩs birthday on April 14, the Bhim Army members had gathered along with several Muslim men in a room adjoining the temple to celebrate AmbedkarтАЩs birthday. тАЬThey had brought many Muslim men from outside. We suggested that they should shift the celebrations to the nearby community hall, but they, in turn, abused us and told us to replace the idols in the temple with that of Ambedkar,тАЭ Birendra says, adding that тАЬan ugly spat broke out.тАЭ  тАЬAll this has now culminated in violence. We have been thrashed for our religious beliefs,тАЭ he says. Commenting on the case, investigating officer Arvind Kumar Yadav told this correspondent over the phone that two persons from each side have been arrested so far. тАЬYou know how it is in such scuffles, both sides give complaints. The truth will come out only in the probe. That is going on,тАЭ Yadav said and declined to speak more.

District police have arrested one person identified as Ajaypuri Goswami (23) in connection with the case after the deceasedтАЩs father lodged a complaint. Kiran Parmar committed suicide by hanging himself with a dupatta from a ceiling fan at his residence in Kanodar village of Palanpur tehsil of Banaskantha on April 23. Kiran used to work with a pharmaceutical company in Ahmedabad. On the basis of a complaint filed by Kantibhai Parmar, father of the deceased, Palanpur taluka police station registered an FIR for abetment of suicide and criminal intimidation under the provisions of the IPC and Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against Goswami and some others. Following the lynching of three persons тАУ including two sadhus тАУ in Palghar district of Maharashtra, Kiran had posted a message on his Whatsapp status following which Goswami allegedly called up Kiran and threatened him over the status while also used casteist abuses against him. Goswami had reportedly told him that the lynched тАШsadhusтАЩ were of his community and not of KiranтАЩs (while using casteist slur). It is also alleged that after this, some other persons had also called up Kiran and threatened him. In his complaint, Kantibhai has stated that three of KiranтАЩs friends had informed him about the threats his son had received from different persons. And when he checked KiranтАЩs phone, he found recording of the threat calls and records of Whatsapp chat. He has further alleged that because of the threatening and abusive calls from Goswami and some others, his son was worried and committed suicide. Deputy Superintendent of Police V K Pandya who is investigating the case said they have arrested Goswami and further investigations are on. Pandya said the evidence collected by them during the investigation has been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for its authenticity and their report is awaited.

The woman and her eight children lived in a mud hut with a leaking roof, her husband Jaglal worked at a brick kiln at a village named Sukulhut some 40km away.

While bigger, more established brands continue to lend their support in these testing times, homegrown sustainable brands have taken upon themselves to help raise funds for the sheer survival of the grassroot level workers. Most of which are finding it difficult to even anticipate where their next meals are coming from. One such example is the initiative by Sudheer Rajbhar of Chamar Studio who has teamed up with Ketto.Org helmed by Mr. Varun Sheth and actor Kunal Kapoor to help artisans of the Dalit Community residing in Dharavi, Mumbai which has recently become a Covid-19 hotspot. Needless to say, the craftsmen and artisans at the Dharavi slums are living in unhygienic conditions with inadequate medical aid and food supplies and this brand is doing everything they can to help them sustain.

The Government should release regular health bulletins on the medicines and injections being given to the doctor and disclose the list of doctors treating him. Also, an independent team of private doctors should be formed immediately to ensure proper care till the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) takes over the case. Addressing a virtual press conference here, Mr. Ramaiah said the Government should have to explain now as the doctorтАЩs statement has mentioned about a shadow party of suspected persons constantly followed and harassed him since the day of his suspension. Does this shadow team consist of policemen or medical staff or YCP activists? For just uttering a foul word against the Chief Minister out of frustration, the doctor was followed, threatened, assaulted and implicated in false cases along with his family members. Suspecting a deep-rooted conspiracy against the dalit doctor, Mr. Ramaiah said that there were now many doubts whether slow poisoning was being given to make Dr. Sudhakar really become insane by the time he would be presented before the CBI and the High Court. If anything happens to the doctor, the Dalit organisations from all 13 districts in the State would revolt and follow a Chalo Vizag call to see and confirm about the health of Dr. Sudhakar. The CM would be held responsible if the doctorтАЩs health was wrongly handled. The High Court had already passed strictures against the Government over its atrocious handling of the doctor issue. Mr. Ramaiah referred to the contents of the doctorтАЩs statement, saying that when Dr Sudhakar got down from his car to urinate on the roadside, a shadow team following him on motorcycle approached him and beat him. Some persons put three bottles of whiskey inside the car. Thereafter, nearly five police constables came there and also two to three plainclothesmen and home guards. The doctor was tied down, provoked, assaulted and bundled like an animal into an autorickshaw. Mr. Ramaiah said that the anti-Dalit and anti-people policies reflected how YCP was perpetrating an unethical, chaotic, undemocratic and atrocious rule. The CBI should check the call records of hospital superintendents, doctors, Dr Sudhakar, his family members and also Minister Adimulapu Suresh and MP Vijayasai Reddy from the beginning. The Government should explain why it was very afraid of dalit doctor case after the High Court ordered CBI probe. Telugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

Accompanied by LJP Parliamentary Board chief Chirag Paswan and MP brother Ramchandra Paswan, he visited the students' hostel in Saidpur and Mahendru to express solidarity with the protesting dalit students agitating against the state government over lowering of scholarship amount for them. ""It (police lathicharge) was a painful incident and reflect anti-dalit approach of Nitish Kumar.

Launching a scathing attack on Nitish, Ram Vilas said earlier he divided the dalits between 'dalits' and 'mahadalits' (poorest among dalits) and now was preparing to stop toddy trade to harm the livelihood of the 'Pasi' (toddy traders) community. ┬й 2021 NEWSNATION.

Viraj Vilas Jagtap was riding his motorbike when the relatives of his girlfriend hit him with a tempo. As he fell down and struggled to get up, the culprits came up to him and attacked him with rods and smashed him with huge stones. The deceased Dalit youth narrated the entire incident to his family while he was being treated at a private hospital. Before he could call for help while lying on the road, the accused attacked him with iron rods and mercilessly smashed him with stones. Pimpri Chinchwad Police has arrested all the six Viraj Jagtap named in his dying statement. Two among the six accused are minors and have been sent to a children's remand home. All six were produced in the court and have been remanded to police custody for 7 days. All of the six have been arrested under IPC section 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence). All of the six have also been booked under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

He shouted at Viraj that he belonged to the Scheduled Caste and Jagdish Kate said, ""How did you dare to have a relationship with my daughter. You belong to mahar maang community, you don't have the standard or class to have an affair with my daughter.""

By Wednesday evening, police had arrested 37 of the 57 named in the FIR lodged on a complaint filed by Dalit community. While additional police force has been deployed in the village, the district administration has removed the Station House Officer of Sarai Khwaja Police Station, Sanjiv Mishra, and sent him to Police Lines. According to police, the clashes erupted after two groups of Dalit and Muslim boys had an altercation over cattle grazing. тАЬOn Tuesday evening, some Dalit and Muslim teenagers were grazing buffaloes and goats when they started quarreling. Initially, the village head intervened, but later, some boys from the Muslim community returned to the Dalit basti where a Dalit man slapped a Muslim boy, and the matter got escalatedтАж There was stone-pelting from both sides and people alleged that firearms were used.

"297",2966,"https://thewire.in/caste/maharashtra-dalit-men-killed","Maharashtra: Two Dalit Men Killed in Separate Incidents, Police 'Acted Late'","Activists say that there has been a dramatic rise in the cases of atrocities in the state in the past few months. Viraj Jagtap (L) and Arvind Bansod. Photo: Special arrangement Mumbai: In two separate cases of caste violence, two Dalit young men were brutally attacked and murdered in Maharashtra. In the first violent incident, that occurred on May 27, a 32-year-old anti-caste activist and an active member of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) was found dead under suspicious conditions minutes after he had confronted caste Hindu men, all belonging to the Other Backward Class (OBC) тАШKunbiтАЩ community. The men had allegedly bullied and beaten him and his friend up over a picture they took of the accusedтАЩs shop. In another incident, a 20-year-old college student was targeted and killed by Maratha men on June 7 for being in a relationship with a woman from their community. In both incidents, the victimsтАЩ families have accused the police of not being responsive and deliberately delaying police action in order to shield the accused.Only after anti-caste activists and political leaders exerted pressure were the police forced to look into the matter seriously. Nagpur incident On May 27, a 32-year-old anti-caste activist and an active member of the VBA in Maharashtra was found dead under suspicious circumstances in Nagpur. The victim, Arvind Bansod, had allegedly died by suicide minutes after he and his friend Gajanan Raut were brutally beaten up by OBC Kunbi caste men in Thadipawani town in Narkhed tehsil of Nagpur district. The prime accused, Mithilesh alias Mayuresh Umarkar, is a local Nationalist Congress Party leader. State home minister and senior NCP leader Anil Deshmukh represents this taluka. UmarkarтАЩs father, Bandopant Umarkar, is a district vice-president of the NCP. Bansod and Raut, friends, had travelled from Pimpaldhara village in Narkhed to the nearby Thadipawani town. When Bansod went to an ATM to access money, Raut had visited a HP gas agency next door. тАЬAn old lady in the village had sought a favour and wanted us to get her gas cylinder refilled. Since there were a bunch of numbers mentioned on the board, I decided to click a picture of the shopтАЩs board on my phone. The owners (also the accused) of the shop saw me click pictures, and immediately confiscated my phone,тАЭ Raut says. Also read: Nepal: 4 Dalit Men Killed by Upper Caste Mob, Activists Point to History of Discrimination By then Bansod had come back from the ATM and he intervened. Umarkar and his friends, angry that two Dalit men were confronting them, began to beat them up. тАЬThey used abusive slurs while thrashing the two of us,тАЭ Raut says. Somehow the two had managed to get out of the shop and Raut asked Bansod to sit at the corner of the shop while he went to fetch some petrol for his bike. But when Raut returned in less than five minutes, he saw Bansod lying on the ground unconscious with a bottle of pesticide next to him. Sumedh Gondane, a VBA activist from the area who has been closely following the case, says seeing Raut back at the spot, Umarkar and his friends put Bansod in their car and took him away to a hospital. тАЬThey did not let Raut enter the car,тАЭ Gondane says. тАЬUmarkarтАЩs behaviour from the start to the end has been suspicious. Still, the police were prompt in declaring this as a suicide without investigating the clear allegations made by Gajanan,тАЭ Gondane adds. In the beginning, the police had only filed a case of abetment to suicide against Umarkar and a few others. But BansodтАЩs death led to a public outcry, with VBA head Prakash Ambedkar and other party members seeking an impartial police investigation into the matter. Activists on the ground have alleged that the story of suicide was not plausible and there were chances of foul play here. Since the accused persons are active members of NCP, Ambedkar has also sought a CBI investigation into the matter. Since the accused in the Arvind Bansod Murder case are related to the Home Minister @AnilDeshmukhNCP, we demand that the CBI take charge of the investigation. The police had already tried to declare the incident as a suicide. #JusticeForArvindBansod pic.twitter.com/06R2PpkqLX тАФ Prakash Ambedkar (@Prksh_Ambedkar) June 9, 2020  As the police continued to stonewall the victimтАЩs family members and activists, and refused to investigate the case seriously, Sandeep Tamgadge, a senior IPS officer from Nagaland cadre but originally a Nagpur resident, decided to intervene in the matter. A delegation of 15 persons, involving activists and representatives of different anti-caste political parties, was formed and a meeting was organised with the Inspector General (Nagpur Range) K.M. Mallikarjuna Prasanna on June 9. The delegation says the meeting allowed them to explain the ground situation to the officials and their demands were eventually accepted.  IG Prasanna confirmed the meeting and added: тАЬWe have now enhanced the sections in the FIR and have applied relevant sections of the atrocity Act. We have also decided to provide security to the victimтАЩs family and his friend.тАЭ Pune murder In another incident, six Maratha men executed a well-planned attack on a 20-year-old undergraduate student, Viraj Jagtap, for being in love with a girl from their community. On June 7, around 9:30 pm at Pimple Saudagar village in Pimpri Chinchwad taluka of Pune, the men allegedly attacked Jagtap with a rod and boulders, and ran a tempo over him. Viraj, who suffered grave injuries in the attack, died a day later in a hospital. VirajтАЩs тАШcrimeтАЩ was that he had been in love with a daughter of one of the prime accused, Jagdish Kate. Four of the six accused тАУ Hemant Kate, Sagar Kate, Kailash Kate and Jagdish тАУ have been taken into police custody. As the remaining two are a few months short of 18, they have been sent to childrenтАЩs home in Pune. Viraj and Jagdish KateтАЩs daughter had been in love over the past few months and the latter did not approve of their relationship. According to VirajтАЩs close friends who were privy to his relationship, the Kates had threatened him two months ago of dire consequences if he did not back off. Also read: UP: Dalit Teen Killed by тАШUpper CasteтАЩ Men After Entering a Temple VirajтАЩs family says they were unaware of his relationship until the incident, and only after his death did his friends share the backstory with them. тАЬThe girlтАЩs family knew about their relationship all along and they had been keeping a close eye on the couple. They had even threatened to kill Viraj a few months ago. We only wish he had shared this with us,тАЭ his uncle, Jitesh Jagtap, told The Wire. Jitesh, who is a complainant in the case, also accused the police of not taking their complaint till the time the victim died. тАЬSoon after the incident, we had approached Sangvi police station and asked them to intervene. My nephew was still alive then and recording his statement then was very crucial. But the police shooed us away and said this was some minor feud which did not need their intervention,тАЭ Jitesh alleged. Even though the incident occurred on June 7, the police registered an FIR only on June 8, hours after VirajтАЩs death. The Sangvi police officials, however, said that they had followed the due process and had waited for the doctors to determine his condition before finalising the FIR. тАЬThe victim was in a critical condition and we waited for him to stabilise. Unfortunately, he died the next day. We immediately arrested all the accused and have secured their police custody until June 16,тАЭ police inspector Ajay Bhosale told The Wire. The case investigation has been handed over to the deputy superintendent of police, Sridhar Jadhav. The crucial link witness, in this case, are VirajтАЩs college mates and his girlfriend. The police said they are still in the process of recording statements. The police are considering recording key witnesses statements before a magistrate as prescribed under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The rise in atrocity cases Jitratn Patait, news editor of Prabuddha Bharat, a Marathi fortnightly newspaper, says just in the past two weeks he has documented over 8-9 cases of caste violence in the state. Of them, he says most incidents have been reported in Jalna, Hingoli and Parbani districts of Marathwada region. These cases range between extreme brutalities to the use of casteist slurs and Patait says in almost all cases, the police have remained passive until the time anti-caste activists intervened. тАЬBehind the fake notion of being a progressive state hides a sordid history of violence against the Dalits and Adivasis. And the cases only get more violent when a person resists or asserts,тАЭ Patait says. Every day, the home department puts out figures of cases registered against those defying the lockdown orders issued in the state since March to curb the increase in the COVID-19 infections. Over 1.25 lakh cases have been registered just under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for тАШDisobedience to order duly promulgated by public servantтАЩ. рд▓реЙрдХрдбрд╛рдЙрди рд▓рд╛рдЧреВ рдЭрд╛рд▓реНрдпрд╛рдкрд╛рд╕реВрди рдЖрдпрдкреАрд╕реАрдЪреНрдпрд╛ рдХрд▓рдо резреорео рдЕрдВрддрд░реНрдЧрдд рддрдмреНрдмрд▓ рез,реирек,резрежрей рдЧреБрдиреНрд╣реЗ рдиреЛрдВрджрд╡рд┐рдгреНрдпрд╛рдд рдЖрд▓реЗ рдЖрд╣реЗрдд. рдпрд╛рдВрдд реирей,репрезрел рдЬрдг рдЕрдЯрдХ рдЭрд╛рд▓реЗрдд рд╡ реорек,релрезрен рд╡рд╛рд╣рдиреЗ рдЬрдкреНрдд рдЭрд╛рд▓реА рдЖрд╣реЗрдд. тВ╣рем,ренрео,реорез,резрепрез рдЗрддрдХрд╛ рджрдВрдб рдЧреБрдиреНрд╣реЗрдЧрд╛рд░рд╛рдВрдХрдбреВрди рд╡рд╕реВрд▓ рдХреЗрд▓рд╛ рдЧреЗрд▓рд╛ рдЖрд╣реЗ. тАФ ANIL DESHMUKH (@AnilDeshmukhNCP) June 9, 2020  тАЬSince the onset of this pandemic, police resources have been diverted into other policing work like maintaining the lockdown and sealing district boundaries.

The woman, Shivani Khobiyaan, was a resident of Kundli area in Sonipat district of Haryana and belonged to a Scheduled Caste. She used to run a salon named Touch and Care. She was a popular social media user with over 1.35 lakh followers on Chinese app Tik Tok, which was declared banned by the Indian government on 29 June. A policeman at Kundli police station, without wishing to be quoted, told Swarajya on the phone that Arif and Shivani used to be friends, and Arif wanted to marry her. She had stopped talking to him for two weeks. On the night of 26 June, he went to her salon to confront her. He asked him to have nikah with him. A spat followed, and he throttled her to death. He then hid her body in a furniture at the salon, and escaped with her mobile phone. The police arrested Arif on 29 June. He has been booked (FIR number 277/2020 at Kundli police station) for murder and under the SC/ST Atrocity Act. A report in The Week says that Arif kept Shivani тАЬvirtually aliveтАЭ for two days, that is, he continued to post videos on her Tik Tok account after she was murdered in order to mislead her family. The report quotes ShivaniтАЩs sister Shweta as saying that Shivani told her on 26 June that Arif had come to meet him. Shivani did not return all night and texted that she was in Haridwar and was doing fine, and would be back on 30 June. It was only on Sunday night that a friend, Neeraj, discovered her body when he went to her salon after locals complained of stench. Recently, a woman from Uttar PradeshтАЩs Ghaziabad was murdered by a man named Sherkhan Choudhary after she refused to accept his offer of nikah. The victim, Naina Kaur, was scheduled to marry a man from her Sikh community five days later. Sherkhan was a popular Tik Tok Star with over 4 lakh followers on the app. An Appeal...

The hypocritical celebs of Bollywood who are money chasers at best and clout-chasers at their worst have started trending the hashtag in the obvious coordinated fashion that has become customary of the entire brigade. The PR agencies of Bollywood have devised their own strategy with the obvious backing of left-liberals to unleash the propaganda in India now. They have included Dalits, Muslims, women and migrants, all in the same campaign which makes absolutely no sense. We have already seen how the left ecosystem has hijacked the movement in America where violent demonstrations, looting, sheer vandalism, and arson is being justified in the name of protests. The eerie similarities between Indians left-liberals and American left-liberals is difficult to ignore. (Read: Shaheen Bagh, NE Delhi riots) Celebs like Kiara Advani, Huma Qureshi, Ileana DтАЩCruz have started putting up stories as part of their hobbyтАФsocial activism on social media platforms.

Ohh, so campaign amount has arrived. pic.twitter.com/E0mUnP0C9M тАФ Manpu (@ipunamchoudhary) June 2, 2020  But somehow these celebs are the same people who tend to remain quietly nestled in their posh apartments of Mumbai when a few kilometers away in Palghar, two innocent Hindu Sadhus are lynched. The reason for their silence is pretty straight-forwardтАФfor the woke Bollywood, death of a Hindu sadhu does not bring the brownie points. But romanticizing the vandalism in West does. And more brownie points follow when you are somehow able to squeeze in the minorities in a campaign which is diametrically opposite of what these celebs want it to become. TFI had reported how the left-liberals were provoking the minorities of the country to mobilize and start impersonating the hoodlums of the US. Funnily enough, they equated the Blacks of America and the Muslims of the country in the same bracket. They are not the same but what is same is the ideals of left-wing which only thrives on anarchy. Nothing, absolutely nothing justifies violence of any kind when in the end those who will suffer are the ones being riled up to participate in violence. The celebs and left-wingers will stay in their high-rise homes and give sermons about how to take up arms to protest against тАШfascismтАЩтАФa word the cabal likes to throw around to put weight behind their statements.

The curious case of the likes of Priyanka Chopra, Disha Patani, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, and numerous others who endorse fairness creams on one side and in the same despicable breath upload a photo with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter kind of makes us wonder what message they are trying to pass.

In September 2019, he had married Sharmila, a woman from the caste-Hindu Gounder community, classified as Backward Class in Tamil Nadu. тАЬSudhakar and Sharmila, from the neighbouring village, had gotten married without anyone else knowing,тАЭ Murugesan, SudhakarтАЩs father, told me. He continued, тАЬShe belonged to an upper-caste community and her family kept troubling us.тАЭ Fearing for their life, the couple fled to Chennai, where Sudhakar began working as a mason. However, 16 days after their wedding, SharmilaтАЩs family managed to find her and forced her to return to her parentsтАЩ house. Sudhakar however, remained in Chennai fearing for his life. тАЬHe came back home because of the lockdown. His wifeтАЩs family, who had threatened to kill him, were waiting for this opportunity,тАЭ Murugesan said. That morning, Sudhakar had left his house to go to the fields. тАЬFifteen minutes after he left, we got a call that he had been attackedтАЭ Murugesan, said. тАЬBy the time we reached the spot, he had died. His mother has been bedridden since then. She doesnтАЩt eat, and is crying all the time,тАЭ Murugesan, who broke down frequently while speaking over the phone, told me. тАЬWe want justice for our son.тАЭ The murder of Sudhakar is one among the rising number of atrocities against Dalits in Tamil Nadu that have taken place during the national lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The lockdown brought not only a daily struggle for food and employment for Dalits in the state but also a sharp uptick in caste-based murders and public humiliations. Under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, the SC/ST Protection Cell of the state chaired by the director general of police is required to collect and publish data every month on the number of atrocities that have occurred. However, the body has not published any of the relevant statistics for the duration of the ongoing lockdown. The office of JK Tripathy, the DGP, directed me to Thamarai Kannan, the assistant DGP for welfare. KannanтАЩs office did not respond to our queries about the number of atrocities that have occurred in the state and why the administration had not published the data. The missing data on the rise of anti-Dalit atrocities in the state has however, been carefully collected by Evidence, an organisation which works on Dalit rights and is based out of Madurai. Vincent Raj, the founder of Evidence and commonly called Evidence Kathir, told me, тАЬWe have been collecting data of atrocities from the police and from Dalit organisations for years now. The lockdown has seen a clear rise in the number of brutal atrocities. If you count brutal atrocities, against SC and ST communities, like rape, murder and lynching, those have sky-rocketed.тАЭ Kathir told me that in January, February and March this year, the number of brutal atrocities in the state were five, eight and six respectively. тАЬAccording to our studies, which we conduct on a regular basis, every month in Tamil Nadu there are about 100 to 125 cases filed under Atrocities act, five to seven of them being brutal,тАЭ Kathir said. тАЬDuring this lockdown period the brutal cases alone have shot up to thirty.тАЭ Several Dalit organisations in the state told me that this high number was despite the systematic under-reporting of atrocities during the lockdown and the Tamil Nadu policeтАЩs unwillingness to register atrocity cases. тАЬIt becomes very difficult for the victims to reach out to police stations because of the lockdown,тАЭ Kathir said. тАЬThe police, on the other hand, cite the pandemic as a reason to avoid filing FIRs or take action. Some form of atrocity is being committed against Dalits every day till date. Perpetrators look at this lockdown as an opportunity to unleash atrocities against the vulnerable communities,тАЭ he added.

In the aftermath of the dreadful incident, many Dalit victims have come forward to recount their ordeal and the atrocities meted out by the Muslims against them. A video of one of the victims, Pooja, narrating her tribulations is doing the rounds on the social media. Giving an account of her suffering, Pooja said, тАЬWe were inside the house when the communal clashes broke out.

They spent the night in the neighbouring fearing persecution at the hands of the Muslim mob on return. She further added, тАЬWe are too scared because they were in huge numbers. Approximately 500-1000 of them had attacked us. Initially, they attacked us with batons. After that, stones and brickbats were hurled at us. Then, the bullets were fired. They looted all of us.

Massive damage was caused to the scheduled caste community. Even the domesticated animals were not spared. Reportedly, three goats and one buffalo were burned alive. According to the reports, a boy named Shehbaz in the village reportedly had an altercation with the children of Dalit colony regarding grazing of the goats. The altercation led to a ruckus between the members of the two communities. However, as soon as the dusk descended, members of Muslim community launched an attack against the Dalits. Around 8 pm, some 100 people from the other village raided the Dalit locality again and attacked the locals in which three Dalit men- Ravi, Atul, and Pawan were injured. The assailants started burning the houses. Many people including Nandlal, Nebulal, Rajaram, Jitendra, Sewlal lost their belongings along with their shelters.

In Dwarka, a man was so angry with his mother for getting into an argument with a neighbour that he slapped her in public. She died. Her death should be seen as the moment we call out the many abusive relationships the elderly live in, with death as their only escape.

A Dalit boy was killed by boys from upper caste families after he prayed in a temple in Amroha, UP. Police is denying it rather suggesting it looks as a тАШfightтАЩ between boys.

Since the beginning of the 'Black Lives Matter' protests, many other narratives have sprung up, with people opting to say 'All Lives Matter' to bring every human in the conversation. This includes our own celebrities. While it is fundamentally a correct statement, the timing of it is not. At a time when people from African-American communities are fighting against centuries of injustice, saying 'all' lives matter, takes away from their struggle and changes the narrative for worse. Sara Ali Khan posted this pic on her insta which say ""all lives matter"" striking the word ""black"" on the post. I know our Indian celebrities were stup!d but this is peak [email protected], I have no words. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/skQD4w3QHk *In picture is Sara Ali Khan's post, which she deleted later* Which begs us to view this in light of issues in our own country. In a grim reminder that caste discrimination still exists, there have been multiple cases of Dalit people being demeaned and in worst of cases, killed, in India. Why are people not talking about these issues, is the question that needs to be answered. A 17-year-old Dalit boy was shot dead by four men in UP for trying to enter a temple. The outrage should be over flowing, but thereтАЩs barely a trickle. 1. A 17-year-old boy, Vikas, killed by a group of 'upper caste' people allegedly for entering a local temple in Amroha. Vikas' father told The Telegraph that the accused tried to stop the boy, but he entered the temple to offer prayers. Later, they came to his house and shot him with a gun. He also said that the police refused to file an FIR intially. Meanwhile, the officer in charge of the local police station, Niraj Kumar said that it wasn't a matter of untouchability, but other issues between the boy and the group. Some accused in the matter have been arrested while the search for the others is on. 2. A 20-year-old Dalit man, Viraj, chased down and beaten down to death for alleged relationship with an 'upper caste' woman. The incident happened in Pune's Pimple Saudagar, where the girl's father, along with other family members, chased down the man in a tempo, hit his two-wheeler from behind and thrashed him with a metal rod and a rock. He succumbed to injuries later. The girl's family, on the other hand, accused Viraj of harassment and stalking. The police has arrested the accused and detained 2 minors. 3. Dalit men in UP beaten, shaved and paraded around with shoes around their necks for stealing a fan from the house of a 'Brahmin man'. The incident happened on June 4, after the 3 men allegedly stole the fan. The PGI police station in-charge, KK Mishra, elaborated on the issue and told The Quint: Cases were registered against both, the men and the people who subjected them to humiliation. рдпреЛрдЧреА рдХрд╛ рд░рд╛рдорд░рд╛рдЬреНрдп рджрд▓рд┐рддреЛрдВ рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рдХрдмреНрд░рдЧрд╛рд╣ рд╣реИред рдпреВрдкреА рдХреЗ рд▓рдЦрдирдК, рдкреАрдЬреАрдЖрдИ рдерд╛рдирд╛ рдХреНрд╖реЗрддреНрд░ рдореЗрдВ рдмреНрд░рд╛рд╣реНрдордгрд╡рд╛рджрд┐рдпреЛрдВ рдиреЗ рдКрдирд╛ рдХрд╛рдВрдб рдХреЛ рджреЛрд╣рд░рд╛рдпрд╛ рд╣реИред21рд╡реАрдВ рд╕рджреА рдореЗрдВ рднреА рдордиреБрд╕реНрдореГрддрд┐ рдХрд╛ рджрдВрдн рдкрд╛рд▓реЗ рдпреЗ рд▓реЛрдЧ рд╕рддреНрддрд╛ рдХреЗ рдирд╢реЗ рдореЗрдВ рдорджрдорд╕реНрдд рд╣реИрдВред рдШрдЯрдирд╛ рд╕реНрдерд▓ рдкрд░ рднреАрдо рдЖрд░реНрдореА рдХреА рдЯреАрдо рдкрд╣реБрдВрдЪреА рд╣реИред рдпрд╛рдж рд░рд╣реЗ.. рдПрдХ рджрд┐рди рдпрд╣ рд╕рд░рдХрд╛рд░ рднреА рдмрджрд▓реЗрдЧреАред pic.twitter.com/eRd4XYF6GC 4. 2 Dalit men, were beaten with rubber belts, violated for alleged crime of stealing money in Rajasthan. The 2 men went to a servicing shop in RajasthanтАЩs Nagaur district on February 16. It was then that one of them was stopped on the counter and accused of stealing money. He was then beaten up by several people at the servicing center, who also violated him with a screwdriver dipped in petrol. When the other tried to help, he was thrashed too. The manager of the servicing center later filed an FIR against the two men, saying that they had stolen money from the shop. The police did not recover any cash from them. 7 people were arrested in the case after huge uproar. 5. An 'upper caste' man allegedly murdered a Dalit woman and consumed pesticide afterwards, in an attempt to commit suicide. The incident was reported by The Indian Express on May 19, 2020. According the her husband, the 27-year-old was walking to a field with two other women. It was then that an 'upper caste' man came and held her hand, when she tried to resist, he hit her with the handle of a shovel. She died immediately. The Superintendent of Police of Rajkot, rural police Balram Meena, later said that they could not confirm if the accused was trying to physically assault her or that this was a case of class divide. 6. Dalits stopped from cremating an old woman's body at a public crematorium by people from Jat community in Rajkot. In a case from January 2020, a Dalit family was stopped from cremating an old woman's body and they had to sit on a protest for any action to be taken. Later, they were allowed to cremate the body, but on the ground, unlike in other cases where it happens on a platform with a tin shed. The FIR was registered 4 days after the incident. 7. 3 men forced a Dalit man forced to eat human excreta, urinated on him over between the communities. A 43-year-old man was forced to eat human feces and was urinated on by caste Hindus in Thirumandurai village of Thiruvarur district. In his complaint, he said that 3 men attacked him when he was coming back from a brick kiln and then subjected him to humiliation over a fight that started between the communities over a temple festival 3 years ago. Arrests were made, based on his complaints. This incident happened in 2019 and led to a lot of furore from various sections of the society. Now these are just cases that have been reported/made it to the news. The fact that a lot of people don't even report these cases out of fear, shouldn't come as a surprise. As someone who says 'all' lives matter, why are they not talking about these issues? Do these not make the cut? Are they so irrelevant that they don't just not get a name of their own, but also don't fit in the word 'all'? Is this not ignoring the entire existence of the people of these communities?","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

But as long as I am alive, I will fight for justice,"" Kausalya said. Sankar and Kausalya. Chennai: Kausalya remembers March 13, 2016 like it happened yesterday. тАЬSankar had a college function the next day and we wanted to buy him a new shirt. All his shirts were old and faded. I had in a mind a peach shirt for him that I had once spotted in a shop. For three months, I was thinking of buying it for him.тАЭ Kausalya, who was earning a salary at the time, and Sankar, a final year mechanical engineering student, went to a shop at Udumalaipettai to pick up the shirt. тАЬWe did and came back home, but both of us liked a turquoise green shirt that was on display at the shop.тАЭ So, the couple decided to go to the shop again. тАЬAfter exchanging the shirt, we had Rs 60 left and Sankar insisted I have my favourite chilli parotta in that.тАЭ But considering that the money wasnтАЩt enough, they decided instead on kambu koozh (a millet-based porridge) and were waiting to cross the road after eating the koozh at a street shop in front of a cinema theatre. Kausalya distinctly remembers people coming out of the theatre тАЬafter the show was overтАЭ. None of that deterred the murderous group that would soon descend on scene. Kausalya, from a caste Hindu community, was hit first on the head. As she lay in a pool of blood, she saw them hack to death her husband Sankar, a Dalit. She remembers the shirt, soaked in blood. On June 22, 2020, the blood stain remains fresh in her memory, the image of it renewed by the Madras high courtтАЩs judgement in the case. The court acquitted Chinnasamy, KausalyaтАЩs father and the main accused in the case who was sentenced to death by a principal court in Tiruppur. тАЬThis is not the kind of judgement I expected,тАЭ she says, her voice choking over phone. A Madras high court bench comprising Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and M. Nirmal Kumar also commuted the death sentences of five others to life sentence of 25 years. Also read: As Symbols of Discrimination Fall Worldwide, Meet the Women Who Blackened ManuтАЩs Statue Earlier, in December 2017, the Tiruppur principal court had sentenced Chinnasamy to death while acquitting Annalakshmi, KausalyaтАЩs mother. The court had also handed death sentences to five other convicts, a double life term to one and five years of rigorous imprisonment to another. Two others, apart from Annalakshmi, were acquitted. Besides upholding the acquittal, the high court also set aside the conviction of two others. According to a report in The News Minute, ChinnasamyтАЩs lawyer had stated that the prosecution тАЬdid not prove the conspiracy between Chinnasamy and the gangтАЭ. He claimed that the video recording could have been morphed. тАЬIf the video of SankarтАЩs killing was morphed, how about mine? I was also attacked; I was also almost killed. Is it also a lie?тАЭ Kausalya says. тАЬI am here as an eyewitness; it is sad that I was never briefed of the case after it went to the Madras high court.тАЭ Kausalya also wonders why the court should finish the case in a hurry, while the state is still reeling under the coronavirus pandemic. A. Kathir, executive director of Evidence тАУ an organisation working on caste-related crimes тАУ says they will soon approach the Supreme Court with an appeal. тАЬWe are already in touch with some lawyers. If CCTV footage was morphed and could lead to the acquittal of the main conspirator, how were others sentenced to life?тАЭ he asks. Kathir says the judgment delivered by the Tiruppur principal court was a landmark judgment and had served as a role model. тАЬThere were only three such judgements on caste-motivated murders, of which SankarтАЩs was the first. This judgement by the Madras high court is undoing all that. It is not just a judgment, it will set a precedent, exert influence on future cases that come up. How can we even expect justice in the future?тАЭ Also read: Maharashtra: Two Dalit Men Killed in Separate Incidents, Police тАШActed LateтАЩ Thol Thirumavalavan, Lok Sabha MP and founder leader of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, agrees. тАЬThis judgement would encourage caste-motivated murders and mercenary killings. ItтАЩs deeply painful. The government lawyer failed to put forth valid arguments, also the lack of a separate law for caste-motivated murders could be a reason for the judgment. The state and the Central governments should pass a law immediately against caste-motivated murders.тАЭ Kathir points out that the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 2018 were not followed in this case. тАЬThe image that the courts upheld justice in caste-motivated murders stands shattered today.тАЭ Kausalya has been left feeling shattered. Pointing out the irony of others involved in the conspiracy being punished while her parents were acquitted, she asks: тАЬExcept for Chinnasamy and Annalakshmi, what do they (the convicted killers) have to do with me?тАЭ But she is not the one to give up hope. тАЬThis judgment is unsettling, deeply so. But as long as I am alive, I will fight for justice. I will live to see justice for Sankar. I am still hopeful.тАЭ","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

We have always loved to talk about how beautiful oneтАШs experience is when shitting in the open. Open defaecation is a much romanticised act. Indians always kept these two things away from their shit; their living space and their burial ground. Like our brother Malcolm X said тАЬChicken has come home to roostтАЭ, itтАЩs now that Shit has come home to smell. The colonial architecture was not only an architectural marvel but its a place where one can study how the Britishers incorporated caste when they were in India. These architectures had their own life and these toilets were the place where the social life was incorporated into a building and buried. This is a story of how the idea that I built brick by brick to this day has been standing alone all this while. It started somewhere in A10, Basheer Hostel of EFLU, but it had come out in an intervention in Bilaspur House toilet while shitting on the beautiful western commode revamping my memories of anti-caste movement and scavenging. I found that I have reached a dead end. This was the first thing that changed my research and life completely. We have a situation in India where scavenging continues and we continue to write about the negligence of the state and civil society. Then there are the atrocities where we talk about the failure of state and civil society. This is the usual narration we have in our society about scavengers. But I made an interesting intervention with the help of a small insight made by Rama Hansraj that all these people are migrants. This initiated my research. I found her insight to be true and until now no one including myself could make the issue of тАШmigrationтАЩ of dalits as a burning point in academia, civil society or in the dalit movement. Even in Tamil Nadu, the caste I belong to is addressed as migrants. The interesting departure I made in this research is through the argument that when we study scavenging or its population we have to look at whether they are actually a migrant or we want them to be a migrant. I argue that itтАЩs not that they are migrants but that we donтАЩt want to imagine them as natives. Because every language state is imagined and built as a тАШmodelтАЩ, (Kerala model, Tamil past, etc) which doesnтАЩt want to take responsibility for the degrading human labor in a given state. For example, the Tamil nationтАЩs imagination is pure and sacred and in that population, we cannot have scavengers as part of it. So they are never assimilated or even pushed out of a given society. I wanted to bring it as a book and due to Covid it has become difficult and hope it comes out soon. As you know me coming to Dalit Camera full time was not a choice but I was forced and all academic doors (except for South Africa, University of West Cape, Department of Humanities) I donтАЩt find I am welcomedHave not welcomed me. My passion was to write about the history of toilets in India. I sometimes jokingly say that what unites Indians across the borders is not their religion or language, but their shitting behavior. We prefer water and the Indian commode. In my study, I want to revisit the Indian civilization because I feel the toilet and the drainage practices are close to the Arab world, which cuts across Pakistan and Afganistan, and which can be closely related to the practices of the Muslim world. I am not born with a caste who could have the privilege to write a book to which everyone pays attention. This study can unravel so many things of Indian culture, especially the emergence of caste can be traced to it. After I found out the societal references to scavengers as тАЬmigrantтАЭ, I started thinking in the Toilet what next. There has to be something apart from we shitting every day. Someone calling us migrants cannot be the crime or root of the problem. There has to be something and ZizekтАЩs intervention that toilet is an ideology was eye-opening and I started to engage. I made another and a very important contribution in anti-caste study, and itтАЩs writings. That unlike ZizekтАЩs argument, in India its not about the toilet, but itтАЩs about the social location of that given toilet is what unique. We donтАЩt mind whether we shit outside, anywhere but we mind that space should not be next to our living space. This research took me to unravel all the caste Hindu sociologists / AnthropologistsтАЩ theorization of caste. I found they were the earliest bhakts who diverted our attention from caste discrimination to caste itself, that its not unique to India. The first person is Mary DouglasтАЩ work тАЬpurity and dangerтАЭ, prof. Veena Das and the feminist approach to caste; then it goes to the recent Prof. Sudipta Kaviraj, Prof. Sumit Guha and Prof. Dipesh Chakrabarthy. This travel was so enlightening that I was taken to the path of Islam not because I read its ideology or because I spoke to those muslims who embraced Islam. But because a decade long research on toilet in the India civilisation revealed that only Islam has a very revolutionary approach to it. Even Buddhism fails at this front, and itтАЩs later that I started to engage with Islam I found so many concepts and practices that are revolutionary in its own way and this started shaping my entire idea of Islam and this is the reason I also embraced. So I worked on a paper for 3 years and I left everything for this paper and it was all that I had for me for the last three years. I forwarded this paper to my Director of CHR, UWC, he read it and said this paper has the potential to even contribute or critique one of Michael FoucaultтАЩs work. I sent this paper to few professors and they said all things discussed are new and that it is an important paper. But No one could offer a position or a fellowship to work on it for a book. Maybe they even felt itтАЩs not as important. I felt I wanted to make a book and also wanted to get some validation from the academic community. I sent papers and applied for a post-doc fellowship. I hardly got any responses and it hurt a lot that after so much of labour to produce an idea, I did not get an audience. Sadly, in some places, I applied for a job and I was not even called for an interview. It was exactly the experiences I witnessed on the ground where dalit activists argue differently and the academia and English speaking spaces scrutinize whose voices are to be heard and whose to be buried. With this Dalit Camera platform, they might not succeed in suppressing my voice. The ideas presented in this paper are not mine alone but it has been shaped by the Dalit camera activity and the innumerable activists who shaped this thought and interaction with my parents and friends. Since I was pushed out of academics, I find this space that kept me alive all along and keeps me rolling is the place I publish the article I wrote. If you enjoy reading it please do circulate to academics whomever you know, its important I engage with them. Last but not least a prominent sociologist from UoH humiliated me that I am not eligible to be a researcher. I remember her. Abstract The paper discusses IndianтАЩs behavior in using and the reasons often considered constructing toilets. I argue irrespective of oneтАЩs religion spatial in India are treated as per the Hindu knowledge of purity and pollution. This can be visualized by the way Indians demarcating spatial structures between the temple/house/public spatial and the toilet, likewise to humans the ideology divided between untouchables to touchable. This ideology was reinforced in individual houses by demarcating spatial between the toilet and the main habitable space in the house. This was also adopted in the government workforce while recruiting members from particular caste to cleaning work. In this paper, I argue these demarcations are a fixed category to Hinduism and these categories are reinforced and reproduced through architectures and space. Purity, Pollution and the Politics of Space in Hindu Society My grandfather named my father, тАШBeauty!тАЩ Our landlord calls him, тАЬHey, Blackie!тАЭ Blacks are forbidden to have good names.

ItтАЩs my boy!тАЭ in the town ItтАЩs тАЬElay!тАЭ in the cheri. [translated from Tamil by P. Rajani] тАУ K.A Gunasekaran Like in the poem, dalits in India have different names in different spaces, a characteristic peculiar to caste. Caste is a system which has many aspects to it, and is often discussed in relation to its community, class, division of labour, or endogamy aspects. I argue that the most unique aspect of caste is in its ideology of having two sets of people, the pure (caste Hindus) and the impure (outcastes). The impure (outcastes) are those who engage in the act of removing polluting substances. The non-polluted/pure (caste Hindus) are those who can access temples, and control the movement of the outcastes according to the pollution rules enshrined in the caste system. The main aim of the pollution rules is to keep the polluting substances away from the caste Hindus. For, in Hinduism, keeping oneself away from pollution is important not only to enter the temple, but also as an everyday activity, irrespective of whether one goes to a temple or not. But what does it mean to keep oneself unpolluted? The human body produces different kinds of waste such as mucus, urine, sweat, feaces, filth, menstrual blood, etc. The body always has polluted substances in it, but in Hinduism it is important to keep these polluted substances away from contact. Then, when does the substance, and in turn the body, become polluted? The substance becomes polluted after it leaves the body and sight. The body becomes polluted while releasing the substance. This polluted body can be cleansed with water to remove the pollution. Since the polluted substance could pollute the body of the caste Hindus, polluted substances are restricted to certain spaces in a given village. The outcastesтАЩ duty is to empty or remove or carry the waste to the designated space, away from caste-Hindu habitat. Untouchables, then, are important to keep the caste Hindus away from polluting substances.In Hinduism, anything dead is considered polluted. Even when a caste Hindu person dies, his/her family will consider the dead as impure and abstain from touching him/her. Hence, the untouchables are used to dispose of the filth or impure object. Similarly, when the domesticated cattle die, they become polluted and caste-Hindus abstain from touching the carrion. Untouchables are assigned to remove these polluted bodies. The pollution rules become particularly stringent when it comes to those castes whose caste occupation is to remove human waste. At this stage, the pollution rules, although irrational, are rationalised by the caste system, and the enforcement of superiority on the pure creates a material inferiority for the polluted. The caste Hindus police the outcastes to perform their duty, which is enshrined in pollution rules. The caste hindus also exercise control over the outcastes and the space they access. This practice has permeated into the culture of South Asia and influenced followers/practitioners of different religions and is not restricted to the followers of Hinduism alone. Unlike other occupations prescribed in the caste system, the outcastes are forced to provide services without expecting anything in return. Rather than a service, the occupation of the outcastes is a form of servitude to the caste-Hindus, as I will outline below. Policing Space and Bodies In the caste system, having control over each casteтАЩs spatial location and place of living is crucial to control the polluted. The system does not stop with the location but also polices the movements of outcastes in each village, similar to the working of institutionalized apartheid in South Africa and slavery in Europe and Western countries. Ambedkar, who fought and wrote an extensive amount of literature on the caste system observed that caste system is a system equal to slavery. I quote, тАШSlavery is a very ancient institution of the Hindus. It is recognised by Manu, the Hindu lawgiver and has been elaborated and systematised by the other Smriti writers who followed Manu.тАЩ (Vol 5: 9) While differntiating between slavery and free labour he wrote, тАШUnder slavery a breach of contract of service is an offence, which is punishable with fine or imprisonment. Under free labour a breach of contract of service is only a civil wrong for which the labourer is liable only for damages. Judged in the light of this criterion, scavenging is a legal obligation imposed upon the Untouchables which they cannot escape.тАЩ (Ambedkar Vol: 5) This policing of the worker, whose body is considered polluted also extended to his physical being and the manner in which he was expected to carry himself. As the Manusmriti notes: тАШ[52]. Their dress (shall be) the garments of the dead, (they shall eat) their food from broken dishes, black iron (shall be) their ornaments, and they must always wander from place to place. [54]. Their food shall be given to them by others (than an Aryan giver) in a broken dish; at night they shall not walk about in villages and in towns. [55]. By day they may go about for the purpose of their work, distinguished by marks at the kingтАЩs command, and they shall carry out the corpses (of persons) who have no relatives; that is a settled rule.тАЩ This is what distinguishes caste from say, a racist social system, however it doesnтАЩt mean both are different. For here, members of the outcastes тАУ the most polluted тАУ cannot be distinguished by color every time, but through markers such as shabby dress, where men should wear only their undergarment, remove their dhoti, and keep it between their hands, and women should tear the saree into small pieces and use that to cover the upper body. Most importantly the outcaste members most speak in a lower tone. The outcaste should not wear slippers, ride a cycle, or sit in the bus. In many places, dalit students should wear specific color wrist band to distinguish them from other students, and so on. These rules differ in different states. Though these markers have been becoming less prominent in the present generation, the inferior and the superior feeling ingrained in the system continues to exist through regulation and management of space and body. And should spatial boundaries be transgressed, punishment is severe. As J V Pawar (2018) notes : тАШIn 1972, Bawda village of Pune district, two dalit women were stripped and paraded naked at Brahmangaon (literally Brahmin village) in Parbhani district of Maharashtra. Their offence was that they were on their way to a well that belonged to an upper-caste(caste Hindu) sopan Dajiba to quench their thirst. Before they could even have a sip, the casteist villagers spotted them and used thorny branches of babool trees to hit their naked bodies.тАЩ Transgression of spatial markers extends to all other things тАУ objects and acts тАУ that mark spatial purity. Dalits suffer and are hurt when they seek to own these objects and acts. When PeopleтАЩs Watch, an NGO working as a watchdog against caste violence based in Madurai, Tamil Nadu discusses the reason for 100 dalits houses being burnt down in Coimbatore, they pointed out that the violence was the result of enforcement of rules which ensured spatial purity in the village: тАШDalits are not allowed to walk in the streets of the upper-caste Hindus, denied entry to the village Mariamman temple for worship. The tea shops have separate glasses or tumblers for the Dalits and the upper-caste Hindus. Dalits are neither allowed to walk on the streets freely, discussing or talking among themselves. In public, Dalits are forced to lower their heads to demonstrate their inferior status. Caste-based abusive language, intimidation and humiliation, often coloured by sexual references are typically used against the Dalits; Dalit women especially undergo sexual harassment and assault.тАЩ (PeopleтАЩs Union for Civil Liberties 2004). In addition to being punished for any attempts at spatial transgression, Dalits were also forbidden spatial autonomy of any kind. On 16th September 1954, Ambedkar while discussing the motion Untouchability (offence) Act 1955 in the Rajya Sabha, in the 7th session said: тАШUnder the customary Punjab law, the snamilat [common] land could be shared only by those communities which were called zamindars, hereditary land-owning communities. The others were non-zamindars. They were called Lamina, that is to say, they belonged to a low class, and they were not entitled to share in the land. Consequently, they could not build their houses in a pucca form on the land on which they stayed. They were always afraid lest the zamindars[feudal lords] of Punjab may, at any time, turn them out. And the people did not venture to build permanently.тАЩ (2426) ContinuesтАжтАжтАж..Part 2 will be published on 18th and part 3 will be published on 19th. write to the author Raees Muhammad [email protected] captures narratives, public meetings, songs, talks, discussion on dalits.

Along with what happened in Rukum, the story of 13-year old Angira Pasi, a young girl who was raped, then married to her rapist and found dead the next day has shocked millions. Their stories along with the many murders and violence against people due to caste based discrimination has led to many calling for more support and justice for the Dalit community. George Floyds death has sparked Black Lives Matter protests across America and the world and many Nepalese people are also having the much needed conversation around racism in Nepalese society and caste-based discrimination. The tragic stories from Rukum and Rupandehi came in the final week of May and along with Black Lives Matter, we are seeing a huge outpour of outrage online and offline with #DalitLivesMatterNepal becoming a commonly used hashtag. Taking inspiration from other websites, I have decided to list the different ways you can support Dalit lives to ensure that they get justice and for us to educate one another and challenge assumptions of family members and wider society. There is a lot of unlearning and learning that we need to go through as a society and whilst it may be uncomfortable; we need to do this. Here are the different ways you can help: The Word Dalit тАУ further reading One of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself on why this continues to happenтАж I might not be able to change the mindset of people in Rukum but I know that caste-based discrimination is rife within the Nepalese communities in the UK.

ThereтАЩs huge discrimination that continues to take place and we can start by having these difficult conversation with ourselves and with our loved ones.

"316",3055,"https://caravanmagazine.in/caste/arvind-bansod-dalit-activist-murder","Dalit activist Arvind Bansod was murdered, not a suicide: Lawyer"," On 27 May, Arvind Bansod, a Dalit social activist and a resident of Pimpaldhara village in MaharasthraтАЩs Nagpur district died amid suspicious circumstances. According to Soniya Gajbhiye, a Nagpur based lawyer who is representing his family, Bansod was murdered by a group of men after they abused him with casteist slurs. The incident took place under the jurisdiction of the police station in Jalalkheda, a town in the Nagpur district. However, the Jalalkheda police initially treated the case as a suicide. I spoke to Gajanan Raut, BansodтАЩs friend who was with him shortly before his death. Raut recounted the events of 27 May. тАЬArvind bhai and I were going to an ATM to withdraw money,тАЭ he said. тАЬThere is a village named Thadipawani at a distance of five kilometres. On the way, we met a woman who asked if we can book a gas cylinder for her. Arvind bhai agreed but we did not have the number. So, when we reached Thadipawani, I clicked pictures of the banner at a gas agency.тАЭ Raut said that a worker at the agency objected to him taking photos of the banner and snatched his phone. Bansod and Raut then walked into the gas agencyтАЩs office to ask for the phone to be returned. Mithilesh Umarkar, also known as Mayur, the owner of the gas agency, was seated in the office. Describing MithileshтАЩs exchange with Bansod, Raut added, тАЬMayur said, тАШSo you are Arvind Bansod. I have heard a lot about you. Now I finally met you.тАЩ Arvind bhai told him to return the mobile.тАЭ According to Raut, Mithilesh then began to address Bansod using casteist slurs. тАЬHe told Arvind bhaiya, тАШYou are from Mahar caste. Do you want to become a leader? Let me see how. You donтАЩt have the status,тАЩтАЭ Raut said. Bansod continued to insist on getting RautтАЩs phone back. According to Raut, Mithilesh subsequently asked three friends, who were present in the office, to beat up the two of them. Raut said the abuses and beating continued for over half an hour. After they left the office, Raut asked Bansod to let the matter go. He then left the area to refill petrol on their vehicle. тАЬI returned in a short while and saw him lying fallen down at the agency,тАЭ Raut said. He added that there was a bottle containing a poisonous substance lying nearby. According to the version of the Jalalkheda police, in the interval when Raut was absent, Bansod purchased a bottle of pesticide from a nearby shop and consumed itтАФa narrative strongly disputed by Raut and BansodтАЩs family. Continuing his account, Raut told me that Mithilesh and his friends took Bansod in their vehicle, while refusing to let Raut join them. тАЬI asked the man who took my mobile as to where he was being taken. He said they were taking him to the hospital. I returned to the village and informed his elder brother about what happened,тАЭ Raut said. Subsequently, Raut, along with two of BansodтАЩs brothers, went to the Jalalkheda primary health centre. However, they learnt that that Bansod had been referred to another hospital. Amidst the lookout for Bansod, they went to the Jalalkheda police station to register a complaint. Raut told me that the Deepak Dekate, the inspector in-charge did not take them seriously. тАЬI told him the whole story. He said, тАШHe has not died yet. Let him get treatment. We will see after he dies,тАЩтАЭ Raut recalled. The three later found Bansod in an ambulance in MithileshтАЩs company outside a hospital in Katol, a city and municipal council in Nagpur. From there, Raut was taken further to Nagpur. He was finally admitted at the government medical college in Nagpur. According to Raut, at 11 pm on 27 May, Bansod was put on ventilator support. He was declared dead on the morning of 29 May. BansodтАЩs death did not receive any attention until a few days later. Gajbhiye attributes this to the remoteness of Pimpaldhara and the lack of internet connectivity there. Nilesh Mohite, the secretary of Dalit Youth Panthers, a Mumbai-based Dalit rights organisation, contacted Gajbhiye on 31 May, requesting her to meet with BansodтАЩs family. тАЬOn 2 June, I reached the village. It is a very small village with hardly 20 or 25 houses. His grandmother was there along with his father and two brothers,тАЭ she said. Referring to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, she added, тАЬHe was preparing for his MPSC exams. In a couple of years, he could have become an officer. As soon as we stepped into his house, his family showed us his library.тАЭ Gajbhiye was accompanied by members of her organisation called Bhimraj ki Beti, a civil society group working for marginalised communities including Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. тАЬHe was a Dalit activist who used to help everyone in the village,тАЭ she told me.

Discrimination against Dalits remains prevalent and enduring. Since 2011, there have been at least 11 recorded cases of Dalit deaths involving issues of caste prejudice. On May 23, Dalit youth Nawaraj BK and his friends were lynched in Soti, Rukum. Nawaraj had been seeing an тАШupper casteтАЩ girl, whose family disapproved of the relationship. When Nawaraj and 18 of his friends went to Soti Village on May 23 to bring his girlfriend home as bride, they were attacked by villagers and chased into the Bheri River. Only 13 survived. Six bodies, including NawarajтАЩs, were recovered from the river. A five-member probe team set up by the government is investigating the case. News media in Nepal have also reported that former Home Minister and a leader of the ruling party Janardan Sharma has family ties with the Shahi families involved in the murder. Speaking in parliament, Sharma said that the Dalit boys were responsible for the Nawaraj BK case in Rukum. He portrayed the incident as just a clash between villagers and 19 boys, with his take being that the villagers had chased the boys, who jumped into the Bheri River, with some of them subsequently drowning. Indignant lawmakers interrupted his speech. Sharma later issued a statement claiming that his speech had been misinterpreted and that he was committed to supporting the investigation into the incident. Meanwhile, Dalit lawmaker Man Bahadur Biswakarma claimed that the boys were beaten to death, tied with ropes, and dumped into the river. Another case is that of 13-year-old Angira Pasi of Devdaha, Rupandehi, where the local ward chair and community ordered the marriage of Angira and her rapist, 25-year-old Birendra Bhar. BirendraтАЩs family did not approve of a Dalit daughter-in-law. The next evening, her body was found hanging from a tree, under suspicious circumstances. Police had initially refused to register the case, but they later detained Birendra Bhar, his mother, Akali Bhar, and his aunt Shitali Bhar in connection with AngiraтАЩs death. While NawarajтАЩs and AngiraтАЩs cases have gripped the national attention, they are but the latest in a series of deaths resulting from caste-based violence. The following is a chronological list of cases that have occurred since the enactment of the Caste Discrimination and Untouchability Act. [th-slider autoplay=""false""] While killings of Dalits have taken place over various accusations, most cases have to do with inter-caste relations between men and women, the violence being more pronounced when the man is Dalit and the woman тАШupper casteтАЩ. That a family or a communityтАЩs hatred for intercaste intimacy should lead to murder says much about the larger issues around casteism, normalization of violence, and fixation on caste purity. тАЬThe Brahmanical patriarchy seeks to control womenтАЩs sexuality and maintain caste purity,тАЭ says writer Sarita Pariyar. тАЬUnder this system, relations are to be allowed only within castes, to keep them separate and thus maintain a hierarchy.тАЭ Similarly, researcher Smita Magar says, тАЬThe patriarchal position that women do not have the agency to choose sexual partners also plays a role in this violence.тАЭ From such a perspective, consent would not validate intercaste relationships. Historical legacies also continue to plague Nepali society. тАЬTo understand the violence against Dalits today, we have to look at the role that the state played in the past. The state itself used to define who could be killed,тАЭ says Magar. тАЬIntercaste marriage was illegal under the Muluki Ain, and although political structures have changed since then, that idea still lingers. There is also the internalized concept of superiority, where rather than awareness that one is committing a crime, people feel they are the ones punishing others for wrongdoing. In their minds, they are just doing what the state used to do in the past.тАЭ It is ironic that NawarajтАЩs case took place in Rukum, one of the epicentres of the Maoist movement. The Maoists had, backed by the gun, prohibited caste discrimination and established a trend of intercaste unions among their ranks. Post-conflict, many of these unions dissipated. Since deterrence through physical retaliation for caste-based discrimination was gone, and there had been no cultural change in terms of perspectives on discrimination, caste-friction reared its ugly head again. The Caste Based Discrimination and Untouchability (Offence and Punishment) Act, 2068 (2011) was the first separate Act enacted to criminalise and punish caste-based discrimination. The punishments it prescribes are minimal: three months to three years in prison and a fine between a minimum of Rs 50,000 to a maximum of Rs 200,000. For public office holders committing the offence, the Act also provides for upping the severity of these punishments by an additional 50%. The Act was adopted unanimously by the then interim parliament. тАЬA positive aspect of the Act is that the government becomes the plaintiff in cases pertaining to caste-based violence,тАЭ says researcher and activist Shiva Hari Gyawali. тАЬHowever, the burden of evidence lies on the victim, which is an impractical provision.тАЭ Regarding the many cases of caste violence not being registered by the police, he says: тАЬIf the police refuse to register a case, one can approach higher authorities for help. The National Dalit Commission can issue a directive to the police to register and investigate the complaint, but implementing the directive is not mandatory.тАЭ Most incidents related to discrimination are non-physical. And the law does not make it clear what counts as evidence of humiliation, verbal abuse, or other kinds of discrimination, making those cases difficult to prosecute. In 2012, the Parliamentary Committee on Women, Children and Social Welfare had formed a sub-committee to research caste-based discrimination, through a field study of 34 districts. Among the cases the sub-committee looked into were the killings of Sete Damai in Dailekh, Manbir Sunar in Kalikot, and Shiva Shankar Das in Saptari. The sub-committee brought Sete DamaiтАЩs killer to book and compensated DamaiтАЩs family, but took no action in the other cases. The sub-committee had also made policy recommendations aimed at providing access to justice, education, health, and communication for Dalits. Then in August 2016, the cabinet formed a probe committee under the coordination of the then Minister for Youth and Sports Daljit Sripali to investigate the killing of Ajit Mijar in Kavre. After the killing of Laxmi Pariyar in December of the same year, the government came up with the structure for a high-level committee on the elimination of caste-based discrimination and untouchability. The government provided Rs1 million compensation to each victimтАЩs family, but failed to implement the recommendations of the probe committeeтАЩs reports. The structure had a three-tier mechanism: a high-level mechanism, headed by the prime minister; a central coordination committee, headed by chief secretary; and a district mechanism, headed by the chief district officer. Regarding the probe committee set up for the Nawaraj BK case in Rukum, Gyawali has this to say: тАЬSuch probe committees prepare reports and submit them to the government. The recommendations are never implemented, and in many instances the government does not make such reports public. The best solution is to form a powerful judicial committee that will not only look into the Rukum incident but many other caste-based cases. The committee can then come up with a long-term vision and plan to eliminate incidents of caste-based violence.тАЭ Dalits have a low presence in state mechanisms, less access to state power, and are economically marginalized--all factors that further reify their social and cultural oppression. Dalits make up 13.8% of NepalтАЩs population. At the level of local representatives, beyond the Dalit woman ward member quota, Dalit representation is at 3.3%. Dalits are featured even less in executive positions. They make up just 1% of NepalтАЩs mayors. In parliament, Dalits have an 8% representation. According to the International Development Partners Group, NepalтАЩs Gender Equality and Social Inclusion report of 2013, Dalits were the least included among lawyers at the time, accounting for 1.4% of total lawyers and 0.9% of total advocates. And according to the Judicial Council Secretariat, for the years 2017/18, Dalit judges accounted for 0.5% of the 394 judges across the three tiers of the judiciary. These statistics correlate with how caste violence is addressed legally in Nepal. Based on a study conducted by Shiva Hari Gyawali in 2018, a total of 72 cases of caste-based-discrimination were registered in court from 2011 to 2016. Of these, 40 were dismissed by the court. Caste-based violence resulting in death or injury may elicit public outcry, but structural and cultural violence towards Dalits, being invisible forms of harm, evade the same scrutiny. They even find tacit acceptance. тАЬIn the aftermath of cases like RukumтАЩs, there is a tendency among people to announce their progressive stance by citing a willingness to interact with Dalits, eat food together, have Dalit friends, and so on. But when it comes to marriage, the same people will revert to ideas of gotra milnu parchha (caste compatibility),тАЭ says Magar. In parallel to casual casteism exists the tendency among non-Dalits to sterilize issues around caste dimensions. This flat denial of caste privilege prevents the building of public consciousness about DalitsтАЩ experiences. For Pariyar, NepalтАЩs intellectual class has let Dalits down. тАЬOur centres of higher learning lag behind in terms of caste discourse. And all around, there is constant effort to legitimize Brahmanical thinking. ThatтАЩs what informs notions of the superiority of the namaste over the handshake or of the usefulness of untouchability in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.тАЭ Pariyar believes that people are more concerned with maintaining a veneer of social harmony than with addressing casteism. тАЬTalking about caste makes people uncomfortable. They donтАЩt want to rock the boat. There is still little conceptual and theoretical engagement on the topic. The deconstruction of caste is yet to happen in Nepali society.тАЭ :::::: Supriya Manandhar Supriya Manandhar is an artist and independent researcher  Dewan Rai Dewan Rai is a senior correspondent for The Record.

The ongoing #BlackLivesMatter movement in the United States has achieved a historical victory in their struggle against hundreds of years of racial profiling and police brutalities against Black people in the United States. Across the world, people have broken the fetters of Covid-19 lockdowns and taken to the streets in solidarity with George Floyd, the black man who was murdered by four policemen. Social media has been rife with expressions of support from across communities, including people of brown skin, South Asian origins in the United States of America, Europe and elsewhere. Famous quotes of black visionaries from Malcolm X to Angela Davis to Audrey Lorde have been sprouting up on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Indian celebrities such as Priyanka Chopra posted George FloydтАЩs last words, тАЬPlease I canтАЩt breatheтАЭ. She added in her post, NO ONE deserves to die, especially at the hands of another because of their skin color.   Priyanka Chopra is famously known to have endorsed fairness products. She has engaged in hyper-nationalist rhetoric on Twitter and encouraged the Indian army to go to war against Pakistan, while being the UNICEF goodwill ambassador. She shut down a Pakistani woman who called her out on her hypocrisy at a beauty conference. At the time that I write this, there are 4,50,462 hearts on her Instagram post in support of the #BLM movement. Many have called out Indian celebrities like Chopra and Disha Patani, who have never said a word about atrocities against Dalits and Muslims at home and yet have taken the occasion to capitalise on the ongoing movement to promote themselves. Haati Chai and the Dalit Card  Recently, Haati Chai, a company, based out of the US and run by Stella Simona, of Bangladeshi origins has come under severe criticism on social media for selling a тАЬDalit ringтАЭ worth $ 2000 or approximately 1.5 lakhs in Indian currency. The controversy about the Dalit ring was brought to our attention by Mumbai-based fashion designer Raveena Gwalia who remarked, A quite similar case happened where one accessory brand came up with a corona virus locket. So many people have lost their loved ones to Covid and to think of it as an inspiration to make some money is insensitive. Similarly, in the Dalit ringтАЩs case, everyone knows what the Dalit community still goes through. They donтАЩt get the same opportunities as those belonging to upper castes. Finding a communityтАЩs ages-long sufferings and struggle as an inspiration and not really empowering them by any means does not seem to me like a decent move.  We reached out to Kamna Singh, a research scholar at Delhi University, who was amongst the first to call out Stella Simona on Instagram. In a statement she sent to us, and which is now being circulated widely on social media, Kamna, an MPhil student at Delhi University, a Dalit woman expressed her discomfort at how the ring had been described on the company website. The Dalit ring has raw unfinished stones, which many donтАЩt find beautiful because they want тАЬperfectlyтАЭ finished diamonds. Just like the Dalit caste, the Dalit ring is very unique and extremely beautiful.  The description misrepresents the contemporary realities of Dalit communities in India who тАЬcontinue to get killed, raped and lynched across the countryтАЭ. Kamna further pointed to the uneducated ways in which Haati Chai was using the term тАЬDalitтАЭ to erase the multiplicity of identities that are encompassed within it. Words such as тАЬrawтАЭ, тАЬunfinishedтАЭ, тАЬuniqueтАЭ and тАЬbeautifulтАЭ do not do any justice to the history of a people who Hindus and Hinduism continue to subject to untouchabilityand humiliation by way of language, social, economic and political marginalisation. Kamna points out the privileged South Asian inclination to draw likeness between racial and caste inequalities; to incorrectly equate the color of oneтАЩs skin with their caste location. She reported the post on Instagram, called them out and demanded a public apology via mail to the brand. Haati Chai responded to the backlash from Kamna and other Instagram users with a rather dishonest response, This ring is meant to bring attention to the struggle of marginalized groupsтАжMy intention was always to bring awareness to marginalized groups in our collective South Asian community, and I cannot bow away from that missionтАжWe will also be changing the caption of the ring to a more in depth explanation of how important and in my opinion, beautiful the community is.  In keeping with this statement, Haati Chai did not withdraw the offending product. They made a patronising gesture and renamed it after тАЬUda Devi-a Dalit woman warrior, one of the тАЬDalit VeeranganasтАЭ, and an anti-imperialist rebel who defied convention and fought for Indian Independence from British Colonial RuleтАЭ.  As many have pointed out, we are yet to understand, how naming a piece of jewellery after Dalit communities and/or a Dalit warrior can тАЬbring awareness to marginalized groupsтАЭ if not to compensate for its rather mediocre design in the first place. Kamna has been blocked by Haati Chai after being accused of тАЭhunting down their brandтАЭ, and her comments have been deleted, in line with casteist practices of silencing and blocking criticism from Dalits. As early as December 2019, Haati Chai had been called out by a handful of Twitter users for selling the тАЬDalit ringтАЭ. Given that itтАЩs been around for a while (since 2017, according to Kamna in a second statement) until the #BLM was taken up by the brand as an opportunity to re-advertise the ring, how many of these has Haati Chai sold? How much profit have they made from this specific product? And how much of that profit has benefitted the dalit communities it claims to honour. Bagging the Brahmin Brands like Haati Chai are not an exception. Brahmin Handbags for instance released a statement supporting the Black Lives Matter movement on 11 June: Black lives matter. WeтАЩve taken the past few days to listen and to educate ourselves, but thatтАЩs just the start. Today and over the course of the next few days, we are evaluating how as a business we can better show up for the Black community through our words, but more importantly, through our actions.  A quick read through their website, and тАЬBrahminтАЭ is synonymous with тАЬtrue-to-our-rootsтАЭ, тАЬintegrityтАЭ, тАЬcultureтАЭ and тАЬtasteтАЭ. They however forget to add that the Brahmins in India and elsewhere are agents of the abiding system of caste oppression and exclusion of Dalits, Bahujans and minorities. Leather work in India is traditionally imposed on the Chamar community, made untouchable by Brahminical ideologies and practices. The Brahmins have never had anything to do with the actual work. So what does it mean name a brand after the тАЬBrahminтАЭ; is it to refer to notions of тАЬpurityтАЭ that the real leather workers of India cannot even aspire to; is it to say that these bags are made by, for and of Brahmin hands and exclusively for Brahmins and those like Brahmins. Does it mean you get to be a Brahmin if you have the money to own one of their products? But that would be an outright lie, because we know for a fact that there is not inter-caste mobility in India. No amount of economic mobility can distance an individual from their caste identity. Marketing Brahminism is also not new, what with Brahmin pickles and the scores of Udupi Brahmin idli-dosa shops across Karnataka. The Brahminical capitalisation of cultures of purity and pollution and exclusivity are one thing, and the тАЬrawтАЭ, тАЬunfinishedтАЭ qualities of the Dalit ring are quite another. Clearly the тАЬcultureтАЭ and тАЬtasteтАЭ-fulness of the Brahmin invokes an aspirational sensibility, while quite opposed to it is the тАЬunfinishedтАЭ, тАЬrawтАЭ-ness of the Dalit. With $2000 in hand, you can have the Dalit, and not be the Dalit.  According to Achuth Ajit,  The deeper you dig, the more rotten it is. The irony is not lost in the description even. They want to sell a Dalit ring (which тАЬmany donтАЩt find beautifulтАЭ). But at the same time, they celebrate the fact that the ring has been crafted by тАЬthird-generation jewellersтАЭ; as if caste ancestry can be the only criteria for judging quality. Why did they have to bring up ancestry? Is it to assure their clientele that though the ring is тАЬimperfectтАЭ, they neednтАЩt worry because the ring has the label of having been crafted by 3rd generation jewellers from LA.  The likes of Haati Chai and Brahmin Handbags, who sell their products in the name of Dalits, Brahmins, Khans and Syeds do the gross disservice of commodifying alike the privileged and the oppressed. The effectively erase the fact and history of who oppresses whom. Since the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, 14 year old Vikas Jatav, Ambedkarite activist Arvind Bansode and Viraj Vilas Jagtap have been victims of caste violence, and yet the #DalitLivesMatter remains a feeble articulation in India. To sell handbags in the name of a community whose entire identity is sustained on excluding and annihilating Dalits and Muslims and then to extend support to a cause of racial justice reeks of capitalist opportunism and hypocrisy. Casteist exclusion and erasure continues to replicate itself in the field of solidarity, where dalit and other oppressed groups who find themselves as vulnerable as African Americans have their solidarity stifled by the Brahmins, Haati Chais, Piggy Chops and Disha Patanis. We got in touch with Stella Simona of Haati Chai, who agreed to an interview. After learning that the brand had blocked Dalit activists, we sent her a set of questions: We are awaiting responses.

In the afternoon Devika went missing from her house, her body was found at a deserted spot near her home at around 3:30 pm.├В The girl├в┬А┬Щs father, is a 45-year-old dalit daily wage worker and the family lived in the Mankeri Dalit colony. Students in the southern part of Indian have protested after the incident, according to a report by├В Al Jazeera. The girlтАЩs identity as a dalit poor brings into focus the challenges the community has been facing for years. In fact most publications have not mentioned that she was Dalit, which is an important factor in highlighting how little access to opportunities (like online education and others) she had, and just how impoverished the family was. The investigation revealed that the girl committed suicide and also recovered a suicide note. The note said ├в┬А┬ЬI├в┬А┬Щm going├в┬А┬Э. The 14-year-old was said to be a good student and did not have a smartphone. The girl├в┬А┬Щs father, daily wage worker is facing hard times during this lockdown. He said she was depressed for not being able to participate in the online classes. тАЬThere is a television at home but that has not been working. She told me it needed to be repaired but I couldnтАЩt get it done. I couldnтАЩt afford a smartphone either├в┬А┬Э. He also stated that ├в┬А┬ЬI don├в┬А┬Щt know why she did this. I said we could look at options, like going to a friend├в┬А┬Щs house.├в┬А┬Э The girlтАЩs mother had recently given birth and the family was financially very strained. ├в┬А┬ЬThe girl was worried she would not be able to study further, or that her studies would be affected,├в┬А┬Э said a senior police official. Kerala Education Minister C Raveendranath has also expressed his concern. He has also asked for a report from district levels education officials on this incident. Due to the lockdown, Kerala schools moved to online classes through the Victers Channel. Which broadcasts 30-minute-long classes under the project ├в┬А┬ЬFirst Bell├в┬А┬Э for 4.1 million students from class 1 to 12. The channel is available free of cost on cable networks as well as over the internet. Although it was reported that a study by General Education Department found out that more than 2.6 lakh students had no provisions for online classes. The data was recorded from over 43.76 lakh students in the state government schools.

For students who do not have access to either a television or the internet. These centres will arrange TVтАЩs at a subsided cost. These centres will accommodate students as per the social distancing norm. It was also stated that the first week, the classes will be telecasted on a trial basis and will invite feedback as to what changes are to be made and will proceed accordingly. Dalits make 16.6% of the total population of India as per National Family Health Survey data. An analysis by Mint shows that the community faces health inequalities as a result of both past and ongoing discrimination and this includes limited educational opportunities, high health risk occupations they are forced to take up, discrimination in access to land, employment, housing and other resources. The lockdown has left many who live in towns and villages of India wondering, how they will survive the lockdown with low internet and the pressures of survival. For girls born into impoverished or conservative families, it could be a lost chance, that was way low on the priority list of their parents who are struggling to make ends meet. ItтАЩs also nudged this question in the face of many and we must think hard about it. Will Online Classes during the lockdown deprive girls of education? And just how can we ensure no more girls are pushed to the brink like Devika was. Shreya is an intern with SheThePeople.TV Digitalist Tech Media ┬й 2021 All Rights Reserved.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

Amroha police have clarified that there is no caste angle in this case. The victim was murdered for a dispute over the monetary matter.  Earlier this week it was reported that a 17-year-old boy was shot dead in an Uttar Pradesh's Amroha on June 6 by four youth allegedly because he prayed at a local temple defying upper-caste objections. The incident occurred in the Domkheda village when the accused, Horam Chouhan visited Vikas Jatav's house at night and shot him dead while he was sleeping. This incident was reported extensively by media organizations including India Today, Hindustan Times, and The Telegraph. with a similar headline suggesting ""Dalit teen shot after the temple visit.""  Following the reports, social media was abuzz with similar claims. Co-founder of Alt News, Mohammed Zubair tweeted quoting a tweet by another verified user, ""There is no outrage by News Channels and Anchors because the accused are not from the Minority community.""  As per The Telegraph's report, on June 1, Vikas had visited a Shiv temple at their village of Domkhera in Amroha district, 400km northwest of Lucknow. India Today quoted the victim's father Om Prakash Jatav as saying, ""On March 31, some youth from the Chouhan community prevented my son from entering the temple. We don't know why they did this. We have never been discriminated like this before. They later beat up my son and used casteist slurs but he was saved by some locals."" The Quint quoted the brother of the deceased saying, ""Around 12.30 am in the night, my brother was sleeping on the front porch of our house when four youths stormed inside. One of them shot him dead with a revolver and ran away.тАЭ As per reports, the police had been informed of the fight between Jatav and the upper caste youth but no action was taken. Om Prakash said this was not the first time that a Dalit had prayed at the village temple. According to reports, the case has been against the accused under charges of murder and violation of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Vipin Tada, Amroha superintendent of police said, тАЬWe have registered a case against four people from a family on the basis of the fatherтАЩs complaint and are investigating.тАЭ Niraj Kumar, an officer in charge of the local police station, said the primary investigation didnтАЩt suggest any dispute relating to a temple or untouchability. He said, тАЬThere is no caste angle in the incident. There is video evidence that Dalits have been using the two temples in the village for decades. There was some personal dispute between Vikas and Horam over some money that the victimтАЩs family owed them."" A similar clarification was put out by Amroha Police on Twitter. In the video message, Amroha superintendent of Police, Vipin Tada said, ""A case has been registered and two of the accused have also been arrested. The elder brother of the deceased owed Rs 5000 to the accused, due to which a brawl erupted on May 31. The accused fled from the village that day and returned only on June 6 to take revenge.""  You can watch the video statement here.  However, the Quint reported that the victimтАЩs family has denied any dispute over monetary matter and accused the police of trying to subdue the incident. On asking if there is no caste angle in the incident then why the case is registered under violation of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, an Amroha Police official told on the condition of anonymity, that 'cases in which the complainant is from SCST category, the charges under this acts are mostly applied.'

The letter states that the statue of Manu is an тАЬinsult to the Indian Constitution and DalitsтАЭ and it тАЬweakens the call of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar to annihilate caste for India to grow as a nationтАЭ. тАЬThe statue does not just symbolize Dalit oppression, but it symbolizes the oppression of women and of shudras. In all, that makes up about 85 per cent of the population of India,тАЭ says Macwan, who is the founder of Navsarjan Trust, a grassroots Dalit organization based in Gujarat. Macwan adds that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the lived reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in his text тАШManusmritiтАЩ. The text is known to have formalized regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. тАЬWhat is even worse is that unlike the statues of slave owners and confederate leaders that have been brought down in the US, this statue was not put up hundreds of years ago. It was put up 31 years ago by a few advocates who viewed Manu as one of the earliest people to write law in India and hence wanted to establish that legacy,тАЭ says Macwan. The statue was put up by a lawyersтАЩ body that got the approval from the Rajasthan government to put it up outside the High Court in 1989. тАЬIt is not like the statue was set up in a public place, it was set up in a place that represents an institution of our government. How can we continue to condone that,тАЭ adds Macwan. There have been many attempts to bring down the Manu statue over the last 30 years. In July 1989, just six months after the statue was placed, a panel of judges from the Rajasthan High Court ordered its removal. Following this, a PIL was filed against the order, and since then the court order for the removal of the statues has been stayed. More recently, in 2018, two Dalit women from Aurangabad, who are members of the Republican Party of India, travelled all the way to Jaipur to climb up the Manu statue and smear it with paint. The two women have an ongoing case against them. тАЬIn 2020, we are not only celebrating 73 years of Independence, but also 93 years since Dr Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. It is high time we get rid of that statue,тАЭ says Macwan. Macwan and members of Navsarjan Trust have given an ultimatum to the Congress government in Rajasthan, stating that if the statue is not removed by August 15, they will call for an agitation.

He alleged that his teammates has called him names which was degrading to the black people. тАЬRecently I discovered a word that I was being called was not what it actually meant. I need some answers. So before I start calling out names, I need these individuals to reach out and please tell me there is another meaning to that word. I saw you as brothers. тАЬ, Sammy wrote on Twitter. Sammy, after listening to Hassan Minhaj talking about how black people are called certain names in his culture, found out that he was being called the exact same word that degrades black people. After Darren SammyтАЩs post went viral and stormed up anger, his fans dug up an old Instagram post in 2014, by his team mate Ishant Sharma in which Sharma refers to Sammy as тАЬkaaluтАЭ, which has a similar meaning to тАШblack manтАЩ. Sammy explained how he had enjoyed being called that name because he had thought it meant something positive like тАШstrongтАЩ. тАЬI will be messaging those people, you guys know who you are, I must admit at that time when I was being called using that word, I thought the word meant strong stallion or whatever it is, I did not know what it meant, every time I was called with that word, there was laughter at that moment, I thought teammates are happy, so it must be something funnyтАЭ, Sammy said.The name тАШkaaluтАЩ refers to his colour in a very contemptuous way like how тАШniggerтАЩ or тАШnegroтАЩ does. The former West Indies skipper demanded an apology from his team mates for calling him by the name. But later he revealed that he had an тАЬinteresting conversationтАЭ with one of his former team mates in SRH about which he wrote on Twitter, тАЬIтАЩm pleased to say that IтАЩve had a really interesting conversation with one of the guys and we are looking at ways to educate rather than focusing on the negatives. My brother reassured me that he operated from a place of love and I believe him.тАЭ The statement did win hearts but was also criticized widely. Actor Swara Bhaskar took to twitter demanding an apology from the SRH team members. тАЬDear @darensammy88 if someone used the N word at a black person & said they тАЬoperated from a place of loveтАЭ what would u say? Same with word тАШKaaluтАЩ & itтАЩs variations. And team members of @SunRisers. Show some decency & spine #SaySorryToDaren officially! #thatsnotcricket @IPLтАЭ, she wrote.

In India alone, Dalit people have been demeaned and killed in the worst of cases but, their issues are still not talked about openly. As much as we would like to deny it, caste discrimination still exists in our country. Sorry what we experience and what we see may not prevail in all other parts of India. Still this caste based discrimination exists in villages predominantly and the poor lower caste face this discrimination a lot. History of oppression might also be the reason of the anger Speaking of which, this Instagram post by ourdirtyunderwear sheds light on how we can learn to educate ourselves on the problems that the backward classes face.

According to news reports, police had received information that senior Naxal cadres had made a money transaction to Ajay AlamтАЩs, the militia commander-in-chief of the Indravati area committee of Maoists to make purchases. Usendi was allegedly on the way to deliver the tractor when police stopped the brand new vehicle on the Barsoor-Chitrakot road. On being interrogated by the police, Usendi let on that he had been given RS 4 lakh to purchase a tractor and Jagat Pujari would mediate the transactions. After police arrested Pujari from Barsoor, he revealed that he had been involved in similar transactions for several months. Supplies included agricultural equipment. BJPтАЩs district president Chairam Attami gave a statement that the partyтАЩs senior leaders would decide on the action to be taken against Pujari. Pujari had been holding the position of district Vice President for five years and continued thereafter since fresh appointments had not been made.  captures narratives, public meetings, songs, talks, discussion on dalits.

A Right to Information (RTI) query and swift action by the State Information Commission finally managed to bring water to a parched remote Dalit locality in Madhya Pradesh.  This was made possible after Rewa-based activist moved the RTI application on May 26 with the Public Health Engineering Department seeking information on the action taken regarding the digging of a borewell in Nevaria locality under Gangev block. Activist Shivanand Dwivedi said in his plea that it was a matter pertaining to Right to Life and offering a reply within 48 hours under section 7 (1) of the RTI Act was mandatory. However, after 216 hours (nine days), Executive Engineer Sharad Patel said that fetching water from a distance of 900m was not a violation of Right to Life. Dwivedi said about 100 Dalit members of the tribal locality did not even have access to this source 900m away during summer and had to look for water elsewhere. тАЬThis (PHE) is the same department which digs borewells in the courtyards of the high and mighty against norms,тАЭ Dwivedi told News18. As a reply to DwideviтАЩs first appeal, Appellant Officer Sharad Chaudhary wrote on email on June 3 blaming the executive engineer for the mess, adding that he has directed the officer to visit the locality on June 2 and prepare a proposal of digging borewell in a week. Meanwhile, on May 30, Dwivedi had made a second appeal to Information Commissioner Rahul Singh through Whatsapp and email. On June 2, Singh issued a six-page notice to both the officers and asked them to appear for a hearing via video conference between 12-1pm on June 4. In the intervening night of June 3 and 4, the PHE officials landed at Nevaria locality in Rewa, dug up a borewell and informed the commission about the move next morning. Stating that the RTI in this case not only offered a reply to the applicant, but also managed to bring water to the parched land after decades of Independence, Singh said herein lies the importance of the Act in serving the common peopleтАЩs cause. Singh said that while technology has been used in some cases earlier as well, it has become extremely useful and emerged as a new normal in times of a pandemic where social distancing is key. This has also helped in faster disposal of RTI appeals, which earlier used to take months some times, while saving money of the state exchequer as well as applicants, he added. Dwivedi said the villagers of Nevaria were extremely grateful to the information commissioner for addressing their water woes that had been ignored for years.","IND","dalit",1,1,NA,NA

The forced abstention from alcohol and his transformation are a part of preparing him for the marriage. We see the hero cancelling his order for his favourite beef dish, solely considering her dislike (although she doesnтАЩt express it verbally).  The short film directed by Dina Chandra Mohan, тАЬModi and a BeerтАЭ, presented by Pa RanjithтАЩs Neelam Productions was released in Youtube recently on June 1, 2020. The film discusses its politics through the unfolding dialogue between Sruthi and Arun, a couple in love representing distinct caste identities, who are preparing to get married with their parentsтАЩ consent. The film runs its course within the ambit of their dialogue. The narrative takes off, as Arun enjoys his тАШlastтАЩ beer bottle with a vegan and teetotaler Sruthi, who had persuaded him to quit drinking. However, in no time, the innocent chitchat develops into a power- related tugs of war. The initial visuals of the film themselves convince the audience about the upperhand, the Tamil Brahmin heroine has over the hero hailing from an OBC community. The forced abstention from alcohol and his transformation are a part of preparing him for the marriage. We see the hero cancelling his order for his favourite beef dish, solely considering her dislike (although she doesnтАЩt express it verbally). тАЬOne of the merits of alcohol is that, it dissolves the systems. It creates a predicament whereby it becomes impossible to lie after thinking twice. We are determined that a liquor shop must be a hundred metres away from civilization, because it can otherwise expose the fragile truths of a community. Is there anything we detest like truth?тАЭ- asked Prof. M.N. Vijayan, one of the key thinkers in Kerala as he addressed the issues of liquor, drinking, society and truth. A holistic analysis of the film is incomplete without considering the potential of liquor to enable a drinker for contemplation and momentary escapades. In other words, it wonтАЩt be an exaggeration to say that alcohol becomes the driving force of this conversation which has political undercurrents. It is the тАШproduction of an otherтАЩ in Arun, by virtue of intoxication, that wins over SruthiтАЩs keen efforts to end the friction in discussion; and thwarts ArunтАЩs deliberate efforts in establishing harmony. The heroтАЩs actual self hops out like a rabbit within few minutes into drinking. Sruthi captures a video of Arun promising, to quit drinking, over the last beer bottle. As Arun expresses interest to view the video, Sruthi passes him the mobile phone; but to her dismay, he continues to scroll over even after watching the video. She snatches the phone from him. At a later point, in a critical juncture of this dialogue, we see Arun expressing the same eagerness to poke his nose into her privacy. He is at the verge of moral policing her private and social life. Sruthi instantly recognizes his conduct as an encroachment into her personal space and sees through his delicate progressive- feminist trappings. Dina Chandra, the director-cum-playwright of the film seems to have detailed the characters as two individuals who are only half- formed in their political outlooks. However the problem at hand can hardly be solved, inspite of their formation as political beings alone. There is a character in S. HareeshтАЩs anthology Adam, who laments that- тАШon having an illicit sexual congress with a so called beautiful woman (as per the accepted norms of beauty and curves) a man is thrown into an aporia- of keeping it a secret, overpowered by an urge to gossip for want of satisfaction. This issue makes the female body/ beauty a site replete with winding paths of discourses. These complexities can be unfolded using the concept of тАШCultural HegemonyтАЩ put forth by Antonio Gramsci. He presents the idea as a variant of Marxist thought, which says a dominant ideology is that which reflects the belief systems and interests of the dominant class in a society. Gramsci declares by virtue of his theory that the values, ideas and dreams disseminated by the social institutions continue to function in the society as the intellectual force apparatus, strengthening the world view of the dominating class and thereby setting the wheel of cultural hegemony in perpetual motion. This concept is universal unlike most other Marxist analytical tools. In Pradeepan PambirikkunnuтАЩs work analyzing food culture, clothing, festivals and other symbols, one can find the reverberations of Gramscian analytical model. Pambirikkunnu analyses how Set mundu/ Set Saree became the common wear of Malayali women and Sadya (Kerala meals) the accepted food of Kerala. He interrogates who own/ owned these cultural symbols. He maintains that the cultural rationale behind such generalisations is clearly domination. Here we have to problematize the тАШdominant aesthetic senseтАЩ which has influenced the society. Contrasting with such tendencies is the only plausible way to examine a subaltern maleтАЩs upper caste insecurities (which also in effect,outrages womanhood and democracy). In a space where elite aesthetics is established as universal, an individual with such a physique is deemed invaluable. This pricelessness makes it a covetous property fit to be robbed anytime! Once lost, it will be a tedious task to find another of same value- is the state of submissive insecurity latent in a subaltern maleтАЩs ambiguous conduct as opposed to his inner self and modesty. A masculine sense regarding social acceptance is alslo at work here. The problem of partner-centrism and societal acceptance are visible in JayamohanтАЩs novel Nooru Simhasanangal. There, the protagonist who climbs up the rungs of class and social value, chooses an upper caste woman as his partner in hope of improving his тАШcultural statusтАЩ as well. The тАШriseтАЩ dependent on other by virtue of marrying an upper caste woman is suggested in this film too. In that case, ArunтАЩs тАШselectionтАЩ has a social dimension (Sruthi argues that it was Arun who stalked and followed her continously on social media platforms). Power conflicts reach its peak and manifests fully, as the dialogue revolves around marriage. Sruthi says, тАЬI never imagined that тАШmy familyтАЩ would say yes to an intercaste marriageтАЭ. This statement spites Arun, who feels she had insulted both his family and community. He understands it as an expression of тАШcaste prideтАЩ alive inside her. While we can reckon in her reaction, the trivialization of consent from groomтАЩs family, what drives Arun to protest, is his patriarchal mindset. He canтАЩt stand a woman belittling him, despite of his loss at the face of her comment, тАЬWonтАЩt your family hesistate to palm off your sister to someone beneath your caste? тАЭ. However when it comes to Reservation, the hero is more rational, unlike the heroine. Arun criticizes SruthiтАЩs idea of reservation as a mere poverty eradication project and enlightens her that it is an affirmative help deserved by people who have been denied rights for generations. Unfortunately, the same hero fails miserably as the discourse develops into the terrains of caste oppression. He is blind to the injustice his community directs towards the тАШlowerтАЩ communities, and puts up a feeble argument that the whole issue of casteism is a brahminical product. It shows the shallowness of critique and self criticism in both individuals. By the close of this dialogue/ short film, we have a heroine who walks out of this relationship. She is provoked to this end, on being doubted of her virginity. We hear her proudly saying that she had not slept even with Arun, her fiance. Dina Chandra, in his interview with тАШThe News MinuteтАЩ had mentioned that this statement by heroine is indicative of a puritanical notion widespread in the society. He goes one step further to add that physical proximity might have lessened the frictions in their bond. The foreword of Modi and Beer is E. V. RamaswamyтАЩs words- тАЬThe way man treats women is much worse than the way the higher-caste treat the low-caste, and the landlords treat the servantsтАЭ, which is sufficient of generating a prejudice in the audience. PeriyarтАЩs statement cannot be given a direct reading in the present day context, neither can it be conceived as a doorway to the film (a film produced and its readings could be mutually exclusive). Therefore it will be better to enter into the sensibilities of the film totally ignoring the foreword. I understand the film experience as an opportunity to disentangle the multilayered conflicts of mutual domination. In this modern times, when domination is being understood as even an organic trait in homosapiens, let us sincerely hope the creative expression of such complexities will reprimand the utterings of simplification. write to the author  captures narratives, public meetings, songs, talks, discussion on dalits.

Former Congress MLA Munnalal Goyal was on Tuesday assaulted by locals when he visited the family of a young Dalit activist who was murdered in Gwalior the day before. Nineteen-year-old Paras Jauhri was attacked by armed assailants and murdered on Monday night inside his home in Footi Colony in Jatav Mohalla. Local media reported that young activist who was in second year of BA was a witness in a case of vandalisation of Dalit icon BR AmbedkarтАЩs statue. Goyal said he was attacked when he had gone to visit the family, whose residence falls in his erstwhile constituency, to offer condolences. Goyal, who represented Gwalior East in the assembly, is considered to be a staunch loyalist of Jyotiraditya Scindia and left the Congress for the BJP shortly after the erstwhile royalтАЩs exit from the grand old party. Goyal had later even claimed that the Congress was trying to тАЬeliminateтАЭ him. He has alleged that when he reached the police station, five to 10 people pelted stones on his four-wheeler, damaging the vehicle. Goyal sustained injuries on his face and leg. He was taken to a private hospital for treatment. Though Goyal did not lodge any complaint with the police, the latter are trying to zero in on the attackers with the help of CCTV footage. Later in the afternoon, Goyal appeared before the media and accused the Congress, saying it was coming after him because of his тАЬgrowing influenceтАЭ in the Dalit community. тАЬThey can inflict as many attacks as they want, but I will continue to serve the public,тАЭ he said. Hitting back, Congress leader and Dalit activist Devashish Jararia said Goyal hadnтАЩt gone to express condolence to the family. тАЬGoyal went there to ask the family not to name anyone in the FIR and settle the matter, which enraged locals,тАЭ Jararia told News18, adding that the bereaved family was protesting with the body of the deceased at the police station. According to the police, JauhriтАЩs family said that he was studying on the first floor of the house and rushed downstairs late at night with multiple wounds. His mother said she had seen some locals flee after the assault. The 19year-old was unable to speak because of his and was declared brought dead at a hospital, his family said. The family has named five locals, while two others are also suspects in the case. Police had lodged a case into the murder, and locals gathered at the Sirole police station on Tuesday morning. - With inputs from Sushil Kaushik in Gwalior","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

The brand sells intricate jewellery, and claims to be one that is inclusive and transparent. But somehow they thought it was a good idea to sell a $2,000 ring and call it тАШDalit RingтАЩ. Image Credit: Instagram, @harnidhk from stories This screenshot started doing the rounds on social media website, Instagram, late last night, and people were angered, and rightly so, especially considering that their latest posts were in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. What was extremely problematic though was their тАШinspirationтАЩ. It read [sic], тАЬThe Dalit ring has raw, unfinished stones, which many donтАЩt find beautiful because they want тАЬperfectlyтАЭ finished diamonds. Just like the Dalit caste, the Dalit ring is very unique and extremely beautiful.тАЭ The statement normalises the fact that the Dalit community is looked down upon due to a casteist culture that pervades our society. It is no secret that the Dalit community has been subjected to injustice and atrocities, and do not have the same opportunities as individuals who belong to the upper castes. To use those years of struggle and injustice inflicted upon a community as inspiration, without giving them proper representation, or empowering them through new opportunities and displaying their craft to their platform, seems like a performative move. Which displays them as inclusive without them having to play any part in empowering the same community theyтАЩre seeking inspiration from. Image Credit: Haati Chai It also romanticises the fact that the Dalit community has been pushed down to a status where the only access to earn a livelihood for themselves and their families are most often odd jobs which are then used as casteist slurs against their community. Not only that, the violence against the community has been at a consistent high. After being called out by many people on the matter, the brand issued an explanation and changed the name of the ring to тАЬDevi RingтАЭ, inspired by Uda Devi, a Dalit woman who fought against the British Colonial Rule but wasnтАЩt given her due recognition in the movement because of her Dalit status. The explanation they posted on their Instagram handle also mentions that they werenтАЩt able to donate to the cause since theyтАЩre an LA-based brand, and itтАЩs hard to vet organisations that do the groundwork in India. With a following of 115k, though, it seems hard to believe that they couldnтАЩt have crowdsourced a little bit of help. We wouldnтАЩt deny that the apology is a step in the right direction, but we hope that the brand will put their money where their mouth is, and be vocal about the atrocities the community faces, and donate to organisations that work for their alleviation. At the end of the day, you canтАЩt condemn violence against one community and stay silent on what another one goes through. Calling Dalit people тАЬbeautiful and uniqueтАЭ is not the answer. It is performative тАЬwokenessтАЭ that tokenises an issue to make one look better. The solution is providing them equal opportunities, better representation, and opening dialogue about their issues is.

Follow my instructions.тАЭ A director telling his actor to shun melodrama might seem commonplace, but Kunwar Pal Singh is a rather unusual filmmaker. In his fifties, the Dalit farmer in Raipur Sadat, a village in Bijnor district, is directing his first film, Maa. The 13-minute short about the pain of losing oneтАЩs mother becomes even more intriguing when you find out that is that it is nestled within a larger documentary, Taraash. Kunwar had always wanted to be a Bollywood director and work with his muse Sridevi, but his modest means and familial responsibilities held him back. It however, didnтАЩt stop the father of six kids from writing six feature-length scripts and many short stories. For decades, people found his passion amusing or downright crazyтАФeven his wife hadnтАЩt read his stories. In 2017, however, his wish finally materialised after a chance encounter with Ishan Siddiqui, then a 20-year-old media student at University of Leeds.  тАЬI was visiting my family in Nagina, my ancestral village,тАЭ says Ishan. тАЬI heard about a man in the neighbouring village who wanted to meet me after he found out that I was studying film. As soon as we met, he asked me if I knew any big directors in Bollywood and said, тАШYou just take me along, IтАЩll do the talkingтАжthey will love my scripts.тАЩ His determination and confidence inspired me to explore his extraordinary story.тАЭ Ishan helped Kunwar make Maa and chronicled the collaboration in his 20-minute film Taraash. тАЬI polished his script and adapted it to a short film as Kunwar mainly writes feature-length scripts. I also shared my creative inputs on Maa. During the shoot, he would direct the actors and we would go through the rushes at the end of the day.тАЭ While the interviewees and actors in the film were largely locals, he cast three professional actors from Delhi as MaaтАЩs protagonists. The result is a crisp metanarrative weaving fiction and non-fiction that revels in the art and effort of making a film. While the crew for both films is the same, the visualisation is differentтАФin Maa, the aspect ratio is wider, the colours starker and the background score more pervasive. Despite the different treatment of the тАШfictionalтАЩ and the тАШdocumentaryтАЩ, Taraash suddenly intercuts between the twoтАФthe fictional mis-en-scene often gives way to the behind the scenes, with the crew, camera and a crowd of onlookers visible in the frame. However, it is more than just a film of the тАШmaking ofтАЩ genre. Ishan not only shoots Kunwar shooting Maa, but also Kunwar and the people in the village watching Maa and their reaction to the movie. Jean Rouch pioneered this cinema v├йrit├й technique in Chronicle of a Summer (1961). More recently, in The Act of Killing (2012), director Joshua Oppenheimer asked some perpetrators of the 1965-66 anti-Communist massacres in Indonesia to recreate the murders on film and documented their reactions to the videos they shot.  Ishan acknowledges these directorsтАЩ influence: тАЬThey taught me the essence of non-fiction filmmaking through collaboration with subjects rather than intervention. I gravitate towards cinema v├йrit├й as I enjoy collaboration. As opposed to the тАШfly on the wallтАЩ format [where the crew shoots subjects with minimum interference], I love getting into the thick of things. I also want actors and interviewees to contribute their ideas. For instance, while speaking to Kunwar about Maa, I realised the story was more personal than it initially seemed. I felt like he was using the film to express his feelings towards his mother. So, I wanted him to live his fantasy and share his truth the way he wanted. Sometimes, something as fake as fiction can bring out the true character of a person.тАЭ KunwarтАЩs character is what makes the film exceptionally delightful. His earnestness and passion for storytelling suffuses every scene. Despite his age and financial constraints, he has a childlike playfulness. тАЬI can write a story instantly. If you want, I can make one on your cameraman,тАЭ he declares to Ishan. тАЬI will set it in London and DelhiтАжshall I show some romance here or there?тАЭ he adds with an impish smile. Kunwar is happy with his directorial venture, but he wants more. тАЬIf we extend this, it will look amazing,тАЭ he says as he watches Maa. Ishan too would have liked Taraash to be feature-length, but as a student film, there were many constraints. тАЬAs Raipur Sadat is a religious area [the Najaf-e-Hind dargah is nearby], it was difficult to get the permission to shoot and organise screenings. After the local police stopped us from filming, I, along with my cousins, went to the District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police and sought their support,тАЭ says Ishan. тАЬThe core crew spoke only English, so the Indian crew had to help translate and liaise. Crowd control was also a challenge, but we had the support of village residents and my family members. They helped manage onlookers and avoid chaos.тАЭ Taraash was shot over two-and-a-half weeks and funded with a Kickstarter campaign that garnered slightly more than its goal of ┬г4,000 with 66 backers. Towards the end of the film, Kunwar says, тАЬAs long as I breathe, I will keep writing. This is my dream. One day, I will find a way.тАЭ As his passion lights up the screen, one canтАЩt help but wonder how many more Kunwars must be cultivating films in their imaginations and screenplays in their tattered notebooks. Taraash has been shortlisted for LongShots, BBCтАЩs first online film festival.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA
"335",3266,"https://www.mironline.ca/growling-discontent-the-anti-casteism-of-the-dalit-panthers/","Growling Discontent: The Anti-Casteism of the Dalit Panthers","The McGill International Review - Canada's premier undergraduate journal of international affairs On August 15, 1972, IndiaтАЩs 25th Independence Day, Raja Dhale, co-founder of the Dalit Panther Movement, authored an explosive piece titled тАШKala SvatantryadinтАЩ (Black Independence Day) in a Marathi magazine, Sadhana. The piece was peppered with powerful imagery wherein he asserted the aggressive Dalit position against caste atrocities by laying bare the contradictions of a postcolonial state grappling with a centuries-old system of injustice. In a crude and discomforting voice, the Dalit Panthers expressed a latent rage against the failure of Indian state mechanisms in enforcing caste justice. Social stratification in Hinduism is based on the ancient Varna system which defines the obligations of тАШcasteтАЩ groups based on lineage and occupation. At the top of this order are the Brahmins (priests), followed by Kshatriyas and Vaishayas (warriors and merchants), and Shudras (manual labour) at the bottom. Outside the Varna system is a fifth and the lowest (out)casteтАФthe тАШuntouchablesтАЩ, or the Dalits, who are considered ritualistically impure due to the тАЬmenial labourтАЭ they perform, including manual scavenging, tanning, and crematorium work. A Hindu is born into a caste and any attempt to change it through marriage or socialization with other castes is viewed as a gross aberration. While plagued with a slew of destructive norms, the fundamental viciousness of the caste system lies in its percolation into every aspect of oneтАЩs life. Those in upper castes are granted greater access to resources, including jobs, education, housing and land, and access to vital needs such as drinking water from village wells, while those who fall outside the caste system, namely the Dalits, are relegated to sub-human status and face extreme violence and discrimination if they attempt to challenge their oppression. Since IndiaтАЩs independence, there have been numerous efforts from both civil society as well as the state to defang the caste system and equalize many of the historic socioeconomic divisions, chiefly due to the advocacy of the Dalit statesman and architect of the Indian constitution, Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. The Indian Constitution abolishes untouchability in Article 17, but lapses in law enforcement and legal recourse are rife. Caste discrimination is an everyday reality that a Dalit suffers, for entering temples, drinking water from the same well, resisting abduction, or eating in front of upper castes. In 1969, a central government report by L Elayaperumal shocked the country with chilling details of the extent of the discrimination surrounding тАЬuntouchabilityтАЭ. In 1971, in outrage, a group of Dalit writers and poets in the southwestern state of Maharashtra formed the Dalit Panthers. Many Dalit youth who sought to fight back against caste-based injustice joined the organisation, which articulated a new and more radical strand of anti-casteism with heavy Marxist undertones. Seeking a тАЬcomplete revolutionтАЭ, as opposed to тАЬpartial changeтАЭ, the PanthersтАЩ popularity reached an all-time high when they were approached by the Gavai brothers in 1974. The Gavai brothers, Gopal Nathu and Babruvahan Nathu, were Dalit labourers who had their eyes gouged out by villagers at the behest of an upper-caste man. An eventual meeting with then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi proved futile, although it was a pivotal point for establishing certain credibility among the Dalit Panthers in Maharashtra. The popularity of the Panthers in the 1970s paralleled the tumult of rights-based political agitation across the globe: Iranians overthrew the oppressive Shah regime, African-Americans participated in civil disobedience for racial equality, Black South Africans militantly opposed Apartheid, feminist resistance gained steam globally and students in the United States led the Anti-war campaign. The Dalit Panthers drew inspiration from the Black Panthers in the United States and advocated a hardline mechanism to achieve the тАШannihilation of casteтАЩ, the dream of Dr. Ambedkar. However, unlike their American counterparts, the Dalit Panthers did not initiate any violence during their existence, but this did not deter the effectiveness of the organisation. At its zenith in the mid-1970s, the Dalit Panthers emerged as a formidable political movement in Maharashtra and had a regional presence in Delhi, Punjab, and Gujrat by organizing mass demonstrations and inventive pamphleteering in rural areas. The PanthersтАЩ limited, albeit significant, presence can be attributed to its inclusivity. According to J.V. Pawar, one of the movementтАЩs co-founders, the Panthers uniquely prompted a shift in the mindsets of Dalit youth with a far-reaching and a fierce appeal. For the Panthers, a Dalit included anyone who was a тАЬmember of scheduled castes and tribes, neo-Buddhists, the working people, the landless and poor peasants, women and all those who (were) being exploited politically, economically and in the name of religion.тАЭ The Dalit Panthers organised mass street demonstrations and shed light on the everyday caste violence which was often hidden under the facade of a functioning societal order. With growing recognition and popularity, the Panthers sought to reach a larger group of people. Komal Mohite, doctoral candidate in the Department of History at McGill University, notes that literature became the strongest arm of the Dalit Panthers movement. Mohite, who is a Dalit scholar and activist, argues that the Dalit Panthers engaged in a revolutionising challenge against тАЬHindu LiteratureтАЭ or тАЬwhite collarтАЭ knowledge. All founders of the Panthers were prominent Marathi writers, and a wave of Dalit autobiographies and realist stories of suffering featured among popular Marathi literature of the time. In an interview with Mohite, she notes that тАЬthe Dalit Panthers were the direct descendants of an emerging Dalit literary traditionтАЭ and that both (i.e. the Panthers and the literary wave) тАЬforegrounded a materiality of Dalit experienceтАЭ. In essence, the radicalism of the Dalit Panthers and their literary works lay in the reclamation of Dalit bodies. The Dalit Panthers lasted for six years, during which their activism grew from smaller localised efforts by a group of urban Dalit youths to an organised political force. The focus of their action, however, remained in rural areas where Dalits were being most exploited. The last few years of the Dalit Panthers were marred by infighting over the tense marriage of Marxist and Ambedkarite ideologies. The latter advocated for constitutional state protection for the lower castes and the former distrusted the state to take responsibility for Dalit rights. Eventually, heightened fears of police repression in the wake of the Emergency declared by Prime Minister Gandhi led to the dissolution of the Dalit Panthers in May 1977. Although the presence of the Dalit Panthers in Maharashtra was short-lived, their legacies lived on for a few decades following their demise. In the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, ideologues of radical Dalit anti-casteism became popular regional figures. However, despite the blatant reality of caste and anti-casteism, little is remembered of the revolutionary Dalit Panthers today. This selective amnesia mostly stems from historical blindness towards Dalits in general and their anti-state radical politics in particular. Anti-casteism has to be made palatable for the upper caste gaze, often through a nationalist lens. A Dalit man can be the President of India. However, a Dalit scholar and civil rights activist will be branded anti-national should he challenge state authority. Caste discrimination is often obscured for those who are born with a non-Dalit name. Discrimination manifests when a Dalit is scalped out of sheer vanity by a Brahmin, but also when a middle-class Indian home sets aside a separate set of utensils for their domestic help. Such inequality is aggravated during times of crisis. In the wake of the government of IndiaтАЩs response to COVID-19, the majority of migrant labour travelling on foot to their hometowns are lower caste people hoping to flee starvation in a lockdown. It is telling that the central Indian government hastily implemented a lockdown without planning safety nets for daily wage labourers, and, in turn, are treating those fleeing hunger as a threat to public health. This is the most recent instance of institutional short-sightedness towards realities of caste discrimination that aggravates the social plight of most Dalits in India. Time and time again, Dalits have fought back against caste injustice. In the age of the internet, digital platforms have emerged as a medium for the political assertion of caste reality, including for those such as Forward Press, dalithistorymonth, dalitnation.com, Equality Labs, and the dalitpanthers_archive, among hundreds of others. These websites create content with the specific objective of challenging the dominance of Brahminical knowledge. Radical Dalit action, whether in the form of a jarring suicide note or transmedia art, has long-since been a common political response among the Dalit youth. Young leaders such as Chandrashekhar Azad, a lawyer from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, have risen to the forefront of anti-casteism movements and larger-scale national resistances against majoritarian injustice, such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). In a struggle against steadily rising crimes against Dalits in India, the current demands of reclaiming public places and attaining political representation mirror many of the progressive calls introduced by the Dalit Panthers in the 1970s. In its unfortunate fact, тАЬuntouchabilityтАЭ is played out in every aspect of a DalitтАЩs public life, and discrimination follows them everywhereтАФin workplaces, educational institutions, shopping malls, hospitals, and foreign countries. In courthouses donned by framed pictures of the beloved Babasaheb Ambedkar, a lower caste man is sentenced to death by the state for a crime an upper-class, upper-caste man can easily bail out of. It is important to remember the political assertions of Dalits in India and the diaspora. The Dalit Panthers expressed a discomforting mode of political opposition to state inaction over caste violence. They believed in change beyond politics of representation and state protection against caste discriminationтАФone that redistributed land, wealth, and political power, however discomforting it may be. Rural processions, literature, and Dalit pride of the Panthers are an iconic moment for Dalit and Indian history. Their contributions to a less unjust society deserve to last in historical memory.

"336",3291,"https://idsn.org/key-issues/caste-based-slavery/","Caste-based Slavery - International Dalit Solidarity Network","This Dalit woman works in bonded labour in a brick kiln in Pakistan. Photo: Jakob Carlsen Despite being prohibited in many countries, slavery is widespread in South Asia. Forced and bonded labour, resulting in a loss of control over labour conditions and terms of work, is often interlinked with the caste system and related types of customary feudal agricultural relationships. Those who are employed as bonded labourers in South Asia are predominantly Dalits, also known as тАШuntouchablesтАЩ. According to an Anti Slavery International report, the vast majority of bonded labourers (around 90%) are predominantly from scheduled castes and minority groups. Weak economic positions and lack of access to resources increase DalitsтАЩ dependence on wage labour. Extreme poverty forces Dalits to take up loans and they hold no other assets to lever their debt other than their labour. In addition to poverty, practices of social exclusion of Dalits push them into bondage. When Dalits try to exercise their rights or resist abuse and exploitation, they are faced with extremely hostile and sometimes brutal resistance by the higher caste villagers that uphold the hierarchy. Consequently, when Dalits resist their oppression, they risk complete boycott, cutting them off from land use, access to markets and employment. Other retaliations against Dalit assertion include killings, gang rapes, looting and arson. There is no accurate number on the global scale of forced and bonded labour. According to the ILO, the global number of forced labourers was 21 million persons in 2012. Out of this number, the Asia and Pacific Region accounted for approximately 11,7 million persons. There are however no comprehensive studies on the number of bonded labourers that have a scheduled caste background. Forced and bonded labour are contemporary forms of slavery, and they are prohibited under international law, including the UN Slavery Conventions of 1926 and 1956, and ILO Conventions. Bonded labour is defined in the 1956 UN Supplementary Convention on Slavery as тАЬthe status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his personal services or those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of those services as reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined.тАЭ The two fundamental ILO conventions are the Forced Labour Convention (No. 29), 1930 and the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (No. 105). 1957. Both of these, as well as the UN Convention on Slavery, have been ratified by India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan and the countries are all obliged to report to the ILO every two years. The ILOтАЩs Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) and Trafficking Protocol of 2000 also specifically include forced labour and debt bondage. In June 2014, the ILO adopted the ILO Forced Labour Protocol 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention (No. 29), 1930 to give new impetus to the global fight against forced labour, including trafficking in persons and slavery-like practices and provide specific guidance on effective measures to be taken to eliminate all forms of forced labour. Read more about the ILO and caste discrimination Dalits are particularly vulnerable to bonded labour, because of their socio-economic status, but bonded labour is also conjoined with caste in the form of caste-based occupations. Two well-known forms of caste-based and bonded occupations in India are manual scavenging and the systems of forced prostitution.

Visit IDSNтАЩs YouTube Channel for more videos on other themes/countries.  Caste-based slavery is a form of bondage based on work and descent, which is carried on for generations by members of the same occupational caste. In South Asia this form of slavery affects Dalits as a social group, and is closely linked to religious, cultural, and caste-based social relationships, as well as skewed land-ownership patterns. In some African countries similar forms of caste-based slavery exist e.g. in Mauritania, Niger, Mali and Chad. As reported by the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, Ms. Gulnara Shahinian in 2008, these old forms of slavery are embedded in traditional beliefs and customs as a result of long-standing discrimination against the most vulnerable groups in societies such as: those regarded as being of low caste, tribal minorities and indigenous peoples (A/HRC/9/20). A range of ILO studies on bonded labour relations reveal the link between the social hierarchies of caste and relationships of bondage, which leaves Dalits, tribal groups, women and children the main targets of exploitation. Bondage is usually passed on from one generation to another and Dalits are often deprived of other options. Other reports by Anti-Slavery Internationalshow how caste-based occupations include degrading practices such as manual scavenging and certain systems of forced prostitution, especially in India and Nepal. Dalits risk discrimination, abuse and economic and social ostracism if they refuse to subjugate. For Dalits, bonded labour is an entrapment with little chance of escape. The UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery referred to these links in a 2009 report to the Human Rights Council stating that тАЬILO research shows a clear link in Asian countries between forced labour and long-standing patterns of discrimination. In India, the overwhelming majority of bonded labour victims in agriculture, brick making, mining and other sectors are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled TribesтАЭ (A/HRC/12/21). Please download an overview of references to caste-based slavery by international human rights mechanisms. The ILO defines forced labour as work or service undertaken involuntarily and under threat or penalty. Bonded labour is usually a result of economic necessity and other external constraints such as poverty, social exclusion and denial of human rights. Bonded labour is reinforced by various customs and coercion and can also be enforced onto other family members, for instance children and marital family members. Often, labourers are not aware of the value of their work and the status of their debt, which is one of the reasons that lead to life-long bondage. Under such circumstances the bondage can be characterized as forced labour.

""We went to the spot and found him lying there"" Police have arrested four people for the violent murder of an Indian Dalit man in Pune, Maharashtra. The 20-year-old victim was allegedly chased and beaten to death over an intercaste relationship with a woman who belonged to an тАЬupper casteтАЭ. It was reported that the incident took place on the night of June 7, 2020. Police identified the victim as Viraj Jagtap. Four members of the womanтАЩs family have been arrested following a case lodged by VirajтАЩs uncle Jitesh Jagtap. They were identified as the father Jagdish, brother Sagar, uncle Kailas and cousin Hemant. Two minors within the family were also arrested. The girlтАЩs family members claimed that Viraj had been stalking and harassing the woman and that the fight took place over the тАЬtrouble he was causing to the girlтАЭ. The victimтАЩs family is from the Dalit community. Viraj was a second-year Arts student at a local college and was working part-time for a transport company. According to the FIR, Viraj had been on his bike when he was chased by six people. They hit his bike, causing him to fall. The Indian Dalit man ran on foot, however, one of the attackers hit him over the head with a metal rod while another threw a rock at him. Four of the attackers held him down while Jagdish used casteist slurs and spat at Viraj for being in a relationship with his daughter. Jitesh explained: тАЬOn the night of the attack, Viraj got a call between 9 pm and 9.30 pm. He left home on his bike. тАЬSometime later, my other nephew got a call on his mobile phone that Viraj had been in a fight in Pimple Saudagar. тАЬWe went to the spot and found him lying there with injuries on the head and other parts of the body. He was still conscious, so we rushed him to a hospital and, in the meantime, Viraj told me what had happened.тАЭ Jitesh went on to say that Viraj later succumbed to his injuries.

A video from Gujrat where a minor girl was brutally thrashed by some men for eloping with a man is being widely shared with a false claim that a Dalit woman was thrashed by Upper caste men from taking out water from a well.  Recently, a disturbing video of a young woman getting brutally thrashed by three men has surfaced on social media platforms with a claim that a Dalit girl in UP who took water from a well used by upper cast Hindus was violently attacked by some men. A member of Parliament of the United Kingdom, Nazir Ahmed shared the video two-minute video on Twitter saying, ""Violent attack on a Dalit girl in UP India who took water from a well used by upper cast Hindus. India is being shamed by such violence against minorities. Indian Government must stop these attacks and prosecute these criminals.""  At the time of writing this article, this tweet has been reshared over 3000 times. Another user shared a small clip of the video saying, ""A Dalit girl in UP who took water from a well being tortured by village men, serious action to be taken on the stupid.""  This video is viral on Twitter with a similar claim. This video was uploaded on a YouTube channel with a title, ""Lower Class (Dalit) girl tortured for taking water from an upper class well.""  The same video was also uploaded on Facebook two weeks ago with a caption Bengali asking people to make this video viral. This video was also shared about 100 times.  Many other Facebook users also shared the video two weeks ago. In the video, one can see three men taking turns to thrash a helpless girl in the presence of other residents. She was first flogged hard with a stick by one of the men with another one holding her. Then, the other two men also brutally punch the girl on the face and back. In our investigation, we found that the video is from Gujrat and the claim that a Dalit girl was thrashed by men in UP for taking out water from a well used by the upper caste people is also FALSE. While analyzing the video, we noticed that the language used by the people in the video is not similar to what is normally spoken by people in Uttar Pradesh. With the help of a reverse image search on Yandex after extracting the keyframes of this video, we found that one of the keyframes of the video used in an article published by News18 on May 27 titled ""Gujarat: Minor Tribal Girl Brutally Thrashed for Eloping, Video Goes Viral.""  As per the report, on May 21, a 16-year-old girl from a remote village in Gujarat's Chhota Udepur district was thrashed by three men in the presence of her father and local residents for eloping with a man a few days ago. Deputy Superintendent of Police A V Katkad revealed that the minor girl had eloped with a man and went to a village in neighboring Madhya Pradesh. The three men were angry with the girl as she had eloped with a man recently, something which they think brought disrespect to their community. The video was recorded by the villagers witnessing the incident, who then uploaded it to social media following which, it caught the attention of police. Reportedly, an FIR has been filed against 16 men including 3 main accused Desingh Rathva, Bhipla Dhanuk and Udelia Dhanuk, at the Rangpur police station after taking a formal complaint from the 16-year-old victim's father. Gujarati news portal, NavsamayGujrat also published a report on the incident. In conclusion, a video from Gujrat where a minor girl was brutally thrashed by some men for eloping with a man is being widely shared with a false claim that a Dalit woman was thrashed by Upper caste men in Uttar Pradesh from taking out water from a well.

The Asian American Commission (AAC) stands with the activists and protesters demanding justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless other lives. We recognize the profound trauma of anti-Black violence, and condemn the 400 yearlong legacy of white dominance that underlies this nationтАЩs history. We urge the AAPI community to stand with our Black neighbors and take action in the shared fight for justice and equity. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) will never fully understand the Black experience. However, our stories and our pain are interwoven. During World War II, Black and Asian American troops fought alongside each other, while Japanese Americans were incarcerated in U.S. concentration camps. During the Asian American Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, activists like Grace Lee Boggs and Yuri Kochiyama mobilized anti-war protests and worked in solidarity with Black organizers to build a powerful multiracial, working-class movement. Moreover, the Dalit Panther Movement found inspiration from the U.S. Black Panthers, and the Hart-Celler Act, which opened the doors to South Asian immigrants among others, was shaped by other key Black-led civil rights victories. The Black community has fought shoulder to shoulder with Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and weтАЩve been inspired by recent examples of AAPI people stepping up and organizing against racism of all kinds. The AAPI community knows what it feels like to experience xenophobia, racism, and perpetual тАЬotheringтАЭтАФphenomena that have only been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. And yet, Asian Americans continue to benefit from the тАЬmodel minorityтАЭ myth and our historic proximity to white privilege. The fact that an AAPI police officer stood by while George Floyd was murdered is horrific and unacceptable. While this individual officer does not represent all Asians, this incident pushes us to confront how AAPI people can be complicit in anti-Black racism and oppression. The Asian American Commission commits to elevating the voices, triumphs, and priorities of communities of color. We acknowledge the deep roots of anti-Blackness within the AAPI community, and commit to engaging in an ongoing and necessary process of healing these wounds. We strive to strengthen our collaboration with not only the Asian Caucus, but also the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus to help advance policies that empower and uplift people of color, like the 10-Point Plan to Address Police Violence & Advance Racial Justice. We vow to raise our voices alongside Black people and other communities of color, and work to dismantle racism in our homes, workplaces, neighborhoods, and institutions. Only by joining together in solidarity will we achieve collective liberationтАФand until then, we commit to fight.

NAGPUR, Maharashtra: Viraj Jagtap was only nine months old when his father died. But Jagtap, who was a Dalit, had worked hard to set up a successful travel and transport business and look after his mother Reshma. Yet on June 7, ReshmaтАЩs dreams for her only child were shattered when Jagtap was cruelly killed in what the Pune police have described as a caste-killing. Jagtap was on a motorcycle when he was run over by a tempo driven, police say, by Jagdish Kate and five associates and subsequently thrashed with an iron rod. Jagtap was only 20 years old. тАЬWhile attacking Viraj Jagtap, Jagdish Kate uttered that Viraj can not love his daughter since he belongs to a lower caste. Jagadish Kate also spat on Viraj while hurling casteist abuses at him,тАЭ the police First Information Report reviewed by HuffPost India says. JagtapтАЩs cousin Pralay Jagtap said Kate and his associates, who are believed to be from a Savarna caste, were enraged by JagtapтАЩs eight year relationship with KateтАЩs daughter. тАЬKateтАЩs daughter and Viraj loved each other since standard 8. But Kate got a wind of it when they were in standard 11,тАЭ Pralay said. тАЬAfter this, Kate stopped the education of his daughter and put restrictions on her movements.тАЭ Pralay said Jagtap and KateтАЩs daughter remained in a relationship despite her fatherтАЩs disapproval. тАЬBefore VirajтАЩs murder, she was constantly trying to call him,тАЭ he added. HuffPost India could not contact KateтАЩs daughter, whose name is withheld to protect her privacy. JagtapтАЩs relatives say the police did not respond soon enough to their requests for assistance and fear that crucial evidence may have been tampered with. Rahul Dambale, a prominent Dalit activist and a relative of JagtapтАЩs, said CCTV footage of the road where Viraj was attacked has been erased. тАЬThis isnтАЩt the first such incident during the lockdown. The incidents of atrocities on Dalits in Maharashtra have increased during this lockdown period and they are being brutally murdered,тАЭ Dambale said. тАЬCases have been reported from Aurangabad, Beed, Nagpur, and now Pune. But the state government is silent on it.тАЭ One such incident, Dambale noted, had occurred in the constituency of Anil Deshmukh, MaharashtraтАЩs home minister. тАЬThe home minister hasnтАЩt uttered a word on these killings despite one taking place in his own constituency,тАЭ Dambale said. тАЬIt is time that the home minister resigns.тАЭ Rising Star Jagtap started his travel company in PuneтАЩs Chinchwad neighbourhood four years ago when he finished high school, said family members who remembered him as honest, hardworking and driven. At the time of his senseless murder, he owned an enviable fleet of taxis including a Maruti Suzuki Swift, a Mahindra XUV, a Maruti Ertiga and several scooters and motorcycles. тАЬHe was the only child of his parents and everything for her mother Reshma Jagtap. In a short span of four years, he had set up an enviable travel business,тАЭ Pralay, his cousin said. тАЬHe was in the second year of his graduation.тАЭ On the evening of June 7, he was riding a motorcycle when he was rammed from behind by Jagdish Kate. The police FIR makes for chilling reading. тАЬViraj survived and tried to run from the spot. But the attackers were carrying iron rods and stones. (Accused) Hemant Kate smashed the iron rod into VirajтАЩs head and Sagar Kate attacked him with stones while Jagdish Kate, Rohit Kate, Kailas Kate and Harshad Kate tightly held his hands and legs,тАЭ the FIR said. The murdererтАЩs did not stop at this. One of them called VirajтАЩs uncle and told him that they had killed Viraj and had thrown his body at a particular part of the neighbourhood. тАЬWe reached the spot and rushed him to the hospital at around 10 pm at night,тАЭ said his cousin Pralay, who said Jagtap was conscious till about 11:00 pm, and narrated the details of the incident to his relatives before slipping into a fatal coma. He died the next day, June 8, at 3 pm in the afternoon. Despite alerting the police the moment they learnt Jagtap had been attacked, Pralay said, no one arrived in time to record JagtapтАЩs dying declaration. тАЬHad they reached earlier, they would have got the details of the incident from Viraj himself,тАЭ Pralay Jagtap said. тАЬHe was everything for me. He was the only reason for me to be alive. He was only 9 months when my husband passed away,тАЭ Reshma Jagtap, his mother said, in a statement to Marathi television channels. тАЬHe had turned 20 in April this year and now he has vanished in front of my own eyes.

(Image: PTI) In a letter to interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, nearly 600 Dalit activists, scholars and well-wishers have urged to remove Manu's statue from the premises of the Rajasthan High Court, saying the statue is an ""insult to the Indian Constitution and Dalits"". ""We are writing this letter because we believe that as the President of the Indian National Congress, which has the government in power in Rajasthan, you have the required power to take a step which would prove historic in strengthening the Dalit movement for equality,"" said the letter written by Martin Macwan, founder of Navsarjan Trust, a grassroots Dalit organisation based out of Gujarat. He said the statue of Manu is ""an insult to the Indian Constitution as well as Dalits, women and all those who believe in equality and justice"". According to Hindu mythology, Manu is the progenitor of mankind and the author of the controversial 'Manusmriti', which codifies the rights and duties of various social groups. Macwan wrote that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in Manusmriti. The text is known to have formalised regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. ""Moreover, the law of Manu stands in total contradiction to what the Indian Constitution has committed itself to, while the latter upholds equality and fraternity, social justice and freedom, the former indulges in archaic teaching about inequality and social segregation, hierarchy and division, injustice and servitude. ""That this country has tolerated this contradiction for 73 years post-Independence is testimony to our failure to live by the invaluable heritage of the Constitution bequeathed to us by Dr Ambedkar and the Constitution-makers,"" the letter said. The statue, built in 1989 by the Rajasthan Judicial Officers Association, has withstood several protests, court cases and even an order by judges to remove it. Members of the Navsarjan Trust have given an ultimatum to the Congress government in Rajasthan, stating that if the statue is not removed by August 15, they will call for an agitation.","IND","dalit",1,1,NA,NA

The writ that names the scholar as its eighth respondent will be heard by the court on Monday. The academic was suspended in March, following the researcher's complaint in December. At that time, she had written to the university, alleging caste-based discrimination and emotional abuse, and had sought a guide change. ""He often discourages me saying that there was no competition during my admission because I'm an ST candidate. I am not ready to suffer this humiliation and demoralising attitude because I believe I got admission here as the DRC found me eligible,"" reads the letter by the student, who calls herself a victim of academic harassment. The student, Amita*, who apparently got a copy of the writ a couple of days ago, tells us that it was 'traumatising' for her. ""I am in a very bad state of mind right now. I was unnecessarily dragged into this. I had sought a change of guide from the university,"" she says. ""What I faced was not an explicit case of abuse. It was subtle and almost difficult to realise. There was a lot of emotional abuse and gaslighting. He is manipulative and often invaded my personal space,"" she says. Amita's complaint was further forwarded to the university's ICC and SC/ST Cell. The ICC had further submitted a report, based on its investigation. ""The respondent should not have indulged in conversations with complainant indicative of his proclivity in making casteist remarks. As evident in his remarks, the respondent has failed to understand that every individual deserves to be treated with respect,"" reads the report. The ICC also said that the academic, Pradeep*, had tried to intimidate its members during the investigation. Amita has further accused Pradeep of blaming her for conspiring against him. ""He told his colleagues that I was an attention seeker,"" she says. Pradeep, on the other hand, tells us that he had never accused Amita of carrying on a conspiracy. ""This is the university's attempt to degrade and defame me. They had suspended me for six months originally and then decided to extend it. I had challenged that decision in court,"" he says. Pradeep, who has previously been dragged into a series of controversies with the university's administration, says that while the student's complaint was only pertaining to a guide's change, the university had misused it to sabotage his career. ""I only added her name as a respondent since this issue was escalated based on her complaint,"" he says. Various student political organisations in the university have also raised their voice against the university administration and the academic. ""We seek his dismissal, rather than his suspension,"" says Davis Titus, the university's NSUI Unit President. ""The university was also negligent about the issue, which led to the complainant being dragged to court, seven months after the issue,"" he says.  *Names changed on request O P E N If you have campus news, views, works of art, photos or just want to reach out to us, just drop us a line.

Schools have been shut across India since the country locked down its 1.3 billion people on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus, leaving millions of children whose families cannot afford expensive devices with no access to education. Among them was Devika Balakrishnan, the 14-year-old daughter of a daily wage labourer in the southern state of Kerala who was found dead near the family home on Monday, the first day of the new school term, having apparently taken her own life. Also Read: Nearly 200 migrant workers killed on India's roads during coronavirus lockdown Indian media reports said the teenager went missing from her house on Monday afternoon. Her burned body was later recovered from a deserted spot near her house. An empty bottle of kerosene was found near her body. ""There is a television at home, but that has not been working. She told me it needed to be repaired, but I couldn't get it done. I couldn't afford a smartphone either,"" said the girl's father, who belongs to the underprivileged Dalit community (formerly referred to as ""untouchables""), according to media reports. ""I don't know why she did this. I said we could look at options, like going to a friend's house."" The young girl's mother had given birth a few weeks ago, and the family was suffering financially, said a report by the NDTV network. Suicide sparks protests Student activists in Kerala took to the streets to protest her death, which has highlighted the inequalities of the lockdown, with pupils in poor, rural areas far less likely to be able to learn online. ""The government action has put the poor students under stress and pressure,"" said Abhijith KM, who heads the Kerala Students Union and was among the protesters. ""It should enable the poor students to obtain computers at interest-free loans to avoid similar cases in future,"" he told the Reuters news agency by phone from Kozhikode district. He said the group had organised protests in all Kerala districts, but limited the number of protesters to 50 in each area so they could follow social distancing rules. Police said they used batons to disperse protesters in northern Malappuram district, where the victim was from. One officer was injured when about 28 students tried to enter the district education office, Malappuram superintendent of police Abdul Kareem said. India has begun easing its coronavirus lockdown, which was among the strictest in the world and left millions without work. But schools have not yet reopened, and Kerala began its academic year on Monday with classes broadcast on television and online for more than four million students. The protesters accused the government of not checking whether all students had the means to attend them. Kerala's education minister expressed grief over the teenager's death and ordered an investigation.

There is an increased presence of people from all walks of life cutting across age, gender and community here. The diversity and difference that exist in the socio cultural life of the marginalized also get reflected in their intellectual and cultural interventions.  We have intellectuals engaging with historiography, literary and cultural criticism, social and political commentary, activist propaganda and other modes of critical enquiry. Though they differ in various issues and points of view the ideological underpinning is the social justice and democracy paradigm embedded in the works of Dr Ambedkar. The significance of Ambekar is that the democratic movement he led was a historic act for regaining the voice and agency of the subaltern in India silenced and crushed for many millennia (Omvedt). It was a radical attempt to break тАЬthe silences of centuries that brood over the history of invasion and colonizationтАЭ as Toni Morrison puts it while looking at the history of racism in her Afro American context (Morrison).  The intellectual legacy and cultural trajectory of Ambedkarism in this critical context is not just a 20th century development but a culmination of more than two millennia old indigenous resistance against barbaric invasions and cultural colonizations. The most eloquent articulations of this protest can be identified in the challenge of Buddhism against caste and Brahmanism, the pre Buddhist Kapila, Charvaka and Ajeevaka traditions (Sekher). The Sramana tradition of various schools of Buddhism and Jainism became the rock bed of alter-native epistemologies and cosmologies in India. It is all the more relevant in South India and Kerala that was part of the ancient Tamilakam.  All our epics the Silapatikaram, the Manimekhalai etc. were Buddhist and Jain masterpieces (Pavanan). Most of the major temples now in the custody of Savarnas or the self-fashioned cultural elites of Kerala, that are more than a millennia old, were Buddhist and Jain ones brutally Brahmanized through extreme forms of violence, persecution and systematic cheat (Valath). Onam and Maveli again hint to this erased historic truths. Sahodaran Ayyappan also known as тАЬPulayan AyyappanтАЭ reminds us about this suppressed past in his poem тАЬOnappattuтАЭ (Ayyappan). The culture and tradition of the whole of India especially south India and Kerala in particular were based on Buddhist, Ajivaka and Jain Sramana teachings. Pivotal importance was given to Dharma or ethics and egalitarian human dignity in these traditions. The Ajivakas, the Jews, Christians, Muslims and Sufis have also historically contributed to the development of the composite culture of Kerala (Ramachandran).  Ambedkar considered the Buddha, Kabir and Phule as his teachers. This again explains the great genealogy of counter hegemonic resistance in India cutting across time and space. So the moment one chooses to adopt an ideological affiliation to Ambedkarism she chooses this long Bahujan legacy of intellectual and cultural struggle against Aryan invasion and Brahmanical epistemology and cultural hegemony.  This is the cultural juncture in which a Dalit intellectual like K K Kochu intervenes in the production and dissemination of knowledge, especially in something referred to as history. His ongoing project to reread and rewrite the history of Kerala from an indigenous perspective is a critical subversive project to de-legitimize mainstream history that is encoded in the epistemes and semiotics of hegemony. It evolves from the Dalit realization that the academic mainstream often reiterates and reproduces hegemony. It is a struggle, in this hegemonic context to develop a perspective from below, тАЬa frogтАЩs perspective,тАЭ as contemporary Afro-British intellectual Paul Gilroy had it (Gilroy).  Kochu traces the presence and indelible imprints of basic communities from Sangham era onwards and critically marks the onslaught of invasion in the fifth and sixth centuries A D. The loss of land and the beginning of slavery is thus scrutinized in hindsight. His deconstructive reading in canonical Malayalam literature is also remarkable. He had aptly pointed out the absence of Dalits in Chandu MenonтАЩs Indulekha, a pioneering novel in Malayalam and the Sudra-centrism of Malayalam cinema (Kochu). His contributions largely fill the vacuums and gaps found in the mainstream historiography and cultural criticism in Kerala today.  Another important writer-activist in the field of Dalit-Adivasi movement is K M Salimkumar. He is a leading intellectual and orator apart from his critical writings on contemporary social and political processes (Salimkumar). He is an ardent critic of anti subaltern policies of the state as well as anti democratic tendencies in the middle classes. His studies on the shortcomings of the implementation of reservation policy, reservation and private sector and social commentaries on important political developments that affect the excluded are valuable as far as participatory democracy and inclusion in our society is concerned. His political critique is pungent and literally nuanced.  K K BaburajтАЩs interventions in the field of Dalit literary criticism are commendable. He struggles to formulate a Dalit theoretical stand point position in his analyses. His studies on Pattathuvila, V K N, K J Baby and other luminaries in Malayalam are atypical (Baburaj). His intense engagement with language, the obsessive indulgence in idiom, the struggles to delve deep into theoretical inter-discourses and philosophical obscurantism often expel the common readership but appeal to the specialized. He has also touched upon popular film and music in his critical exercise. His mature contributions are yet to come.  Sunny M Kapikkad is a young fire-brand spokesman and activist-critic of the Dalit cause in Kerala. His writing and speeches are charged with the spirit of liberation and retribution. He is at the helm of all Dalit struggles in Kerala today, whether it is for land or for political rights. His critical practice is very much linked to his community work and social activism. He has plenty of years of experience in social activism at the grass root level and has widely published on Dalit issues (Kapikkad). He is again going to make the future of Dalit cultural politics in Malayalam a turbulent and happening space.  Pradeepan Pampirikunnu has also established himself as a Dalit critic operating in a fairly balanced academic framework. His studies and analyses done from a specifically Dalit perspective are illuminating and scholarly. His pioneering work on Dalit Studies is a unique attempt to historicize and critically textualize this new mode of writing in Malayalam (Pampirikunnu). The critical scholarship of Pradeepan is of immense value to the future developments of our field of enquiry.  Another young scholar and critic is V V Swamy. He is also active as a teacher, community organizer and social worker. He has compiled and edited the songs of Poykayil Appachan (Swamy). He has authored many works on the PRDS movement. His literary studies are tinged with sharp social and political critique. His writing is marked for its simplicity and clarity. His focus on education and the public sphere for analysis is again significant as far as the common people are concerned.  There are also plenty of new and upcoming youngsters in Dalit critical practice today. A Arun, K V Sasi, O K Santhosh, K K Shinymol to name a few promising futures. They all address and interrogate the issues of cultural exclusion and marginality in the context of caste and Brahmanism from their specific locations of culture within Kerala. Though they differ in their methodologies and ideological affiliations their thrust is to analyze sites of power and subordination. They try to deconstruct hegemonic and fascist narratives and worldviews. They resist hegemony and disseminate the cultural capitals to the denied and subjugated. They try to reread the canon and rewrite the aesthetics in an egalitarian and ethical manner. They are also providing critical backup to the new writing emerging from the Dalit authors themselves.  But unfortunately some of them are adopting an exclusive rather than an inclusive critical practice. They should get rid of their exclusivist fundamentalism that sabotages larger political formations, alliances and possible democratic futures. The visions and agendas of the Dalit writers should enlarge and encompass the greater questions of inclusive social democracy envisaged by the Lokayathas, the Buddha, Kabir, Phule, Ambedkar, Vaikundha Swamy, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and others. They should not forget that they are the torch-bearers of this indigenous democratic tradition, the Bahujan or peoplesтАЩ culture in India. They should not be carried away further by the divide and rule strategy of Brahmanical imperialism (old and new) that has been enslaving them for the last three or four thousand years (Pandian). They are to be extremely vigilant about the cleavages projected by the Vamana ideology that covertly tries to create splits and schisms in the solidarity of the basic communities and aborts the radical brotherhood among the former untouchables and Chandals. If Sudras can de-link from the Brahmanical meta-referntial structure let them also join this great peopleтАЩs movement, the Bahujan cultural politics and tradition of India.  The emerging critical writers should realize the importance of Dalit Buhujan solidarity, a broader liberating alliance of the people subjected and exploited by Hindu colonization for centuries. They must acknowledge and emphasize the fact that only such an emancipating alliance of the outcastes, women and non-elite minorities in India can effectively initiate social change, sustain democracy and resist cultural nationalism and fascism in Kerala and India in the 21st century. The challenges are complex and plural and so need to be the countering critical and democratic projects. This is the serious and strategic task ahead for the new Dalit critical writers.  ~~~  Works Cited  Ayyappan, Sahodaran. Padya Krithikal. Thrissur: Kerala Sahitya Academy, 1991(1934).  Baburaj, K K.

Communal Tension Escalates In Jaunpur, UP ├втВмтАЬ The Second Angle","Police inspecting the Dalit colony in Batheti village of Jaunpur. (Picture Credit: Kumar Ashish, Indian Express) A horrible clash erupted between the Muslims and Dalits in Betethi village of Jaunpur district in UP on 9 June. An altercation among boys on the insignificant matter of cattle grazing, when buffaloes of the Dalit group struck a goat of the Muslim group while grazing, and that started a feud among both the group.

In a conversation with The Indian express, commanding officer at the scene, SHO Sanjiv Mishra told: тАЬOn Tuesday evening, some Dalit and Muslim teenagers were grazing buffaloes and goats when they started quarreling. Initially, the village head intervened, but later, some boys from the Muslim community returned to the Dalit Basti where a Dalit man slapped a Muslim boy, and the matter got escalate. There was stone-pelting from both sides and people alleged that firearms were used. Eleven boys from both the communities were injured in the stone-pelting. Later, a group of Muslim men indulged in arson and set fire to Dalit huts, тАЭ The complaint lodged by the Dalit community, alleges that the fight broke out when the Muslim boys hurled casteist abuses on them. тАЬWhen this was opposed, they started beating up my cousins. When some family members, including mothers of my cousins, went to inquire about the incident to the house of the accused, they had to face abuses. Around 6 pm, 57 identified and 20-25 unidentified people from the Muslim community came to our basti with sticks and weapons threatened to kill us.

As per the deceased boyтАЩs father, an argument had broken out between four тАШupper casteтАЩ men and the boy he entered a temple in Dhoom Khera village. тАЬSome people, including Horam Chauhan, a youth from an affluent upper-caste family, tried to stop him from entering the temple on the ground of his Jatav identity. But Vikas ignored them and offered prayers there,тАЭ the deceased father, Om Prakash Jatav, said. Om Prakash has also alleged that the boy was beaten up and the police refused to file an FIR. тАЬAfter he had finished praying, several upper-caste villagers thrashed him. We approached the police at the time but they refused to register an FIR, he said. Late night on Saturday, Jatav was sleeping inside his house when all the four accused barged in and opened fire at him. Hearing the gunshots, JatavтАЩs family rushed to rescue him, following which the accused escaped. Vikas was profusely bleeding after being shot and succumbed to the injuries before he could reach the hospital. The accused were identified as Lalal Chauhan, Horam Chauhan, Bhushan, and Jasveer. All four accused have been booked under section 3012 of the Indian penal code and the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Two of themтАЬLala Chauhan and Horam Chauhan have been arrested and the remaining two will be nabbed soon,тАЭ a police officer. Soon after the news spread, people on social media began to question тАШDo Dalits live matter in India. #Dalitslivematter hashtag was also trending on twitter. Netizens also questioned as to why there was not much outrage about the Dalit boyтАЩs death, at a time when people are protesting about George FloydтАЩs death. However, the police have also sais that the murder was a result of the dispute over money. During the initial probe, it has come to the fore that there was a dispute between Vikas and the accused over money. тАЬThe brother of Vikas had taken a mango orchard on rent. Lala and Horam were also partners with him. Lately, they fell out after a money dispute, here was a brief fight over it a few days ago,тАЭ Vipin Tada, superintendent of police, Amroha, said. In a similar kind of incident, three oppressed caste men were tied up, beaten, forcefully tonsured and paraded with shoes hung around their necks in LucknowтАЩs Barauli Khalilabad village. Out of the three, one belonged to the OBC and the other two belonged to Scheduled Castes and were allegedly caught stealing a fan from a house of a тАШBrahmin manтАЩ, the local police said. After the family caught the three men, other villagers also gathered, and soon the mob started thrashing them. To humiliate them further, they shaved their heads abruptly and paraded them around the village with shoes hung around their neckтАЭ said PGI police station in-charge KK Mishra. This is the second major incident of atrocities against Dalits being reported from Uttar Pradesh in a week. Dalits are at the bottom of IndiaтАЩs ancient caste hierarchy, whose membership was determined at birth and have historically faced violence, segregation and been barred from having their shadows touch those of people from higher castes. Even as Dalits continue to battle day-to-day discrimination and isolation, they are expected to consider themselves тАШequalтАЩ in times of crisis, go with the flow and extend their cooperation when fighting a common problem, which, at present, is the challenge posed by the novel coronavirus. Dalits were among the worst hit by IndiaтАЩs strict lockdown, often having to wait longer for their turn to receive food or financial aid at local distribution points, and even being turned away. People need to understand that every person should be treated equally and every life matters. No person is superior to others. We need to end racism. Your email address will not be published.

VHP sources said the Hindu group did not expect an ""indifferent attitude"" of the state government, that too when Khattar himself comes from the 'Sangh' background. A VHP delegation had met the Chief Minister last month, but the government has not taken any step in investigating the cases nor has it filed cases against the suspects. ""We fail to understand the compulsions of the government; it only reflects the indifference of the ruling dispensation,"" said a VHP leader. Ayodhya Ram Mandir Trust Donations Affected Due to COVID-19 Spread And Lockdown, Body Receives Rs 4.70 Crore in 2 Months. ""Anti-Hindu elements in Mewat feel encouraged by the government's attitude. No Hindus are left in over 100 villages of that region. We are capable of protecting Hindus' interests and are not dependent on any government. But we hope the government would fulfill its responsibility,"" VHP's national spokesperson Vinod Bansal told IANS. Located around 75 km south of Delhi, Mewat district was carved out of Gurugram and Faridabad in 2005 by the Congress government. In 2016, the Khattar government changed its name to Nuh. The VHP and other Sangh outfits have alleged large-scale religious conversion and Dalit persecution in some villages of Mewat. VHP's Joint General Secretary Surendra Jain led a team and met the CM last month and handed him a startling report that claimed that Hindus have migrated from 103 villages out of the total 500 and the community is reduced to a ""hopeless minority"" in 84 other villages. Parishad leaders said the CM had assured them of investigation into the matter. ""The police in that region do not register cases involving kidnapping of Dalit girls and sexual assaults on them. Large chunks of land are being forcibly registered in others' names and temples are being taken over, forcing migration of Hindus. But now the government will not only have to pay attention to such criminal acts, but also act decisively against the perpetrators,"" said Surendra Jain. Bansal said former Justice Pawan Kumar has investigated incidents of Dalit persecution and a team, formed at VHP's instance and led by G.D. Bakshi, has submitted its report. National Commission for Scheduled Castes executive member Dr Ramshankar Katheria too has visited the area and investigated the cases. ""Anti-national activities are continuing in the area which has now become a hub of Rohingya Muslims. Funding from Pakistan has enabled many five-star madrasas to function from the region. In one instance in 2018, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested a youth in a case of Laskhkar-e-Taiba (LeT)-funded madrasa. Since this area is close to the national capital, the probe agencies must keep a close watch on it,"" said Bansal. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 12, 2020 07:52 PM IST.

MAHARASHTRA Even with a severely long-lasting pandemic knocking at our doors, the world doesnтАЩt seem to get over its problems of racism, casteism, and religious discrimination. After a horrid display of racism in the USA, India very recently housed another murder in the name of casteism.Night of 7th June 2020 saw the murder of a 20-year-old Dalit boy on the grounds of allegedly having a relationship with a girl of тАЬhigher casteтАЭ. The apparently тАШhigherтАЩ caste judged the relationship to be a crime and cold-heartedly lynched the boy on the road who later succumbed to his injuries. The ghastly incident took place at Pimple Saudagar area, which is in the suburbs of Pune district. The Dalit boy has been identified as Viraj Vilas Jagtap. The boyтАЩs uncle filed the FIR or First Information Report regarding his death which is synonymous with murder. Four people who are accused of the incident have been MAHARASHTRA taken into custody, including the girlтАЩs father and two minors. They have been booked under the claims of murder and provisions in favor of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities Act). According to the FIR, Viraj Vilas Jagtap, who was on a bike, was chased by 6 people in a tempo. On being hit by it, he fell down. Injuries on him were from being hit by an iron rod and pelted with stones in the middle of the road. After this, he was held back by four accused while the girlтАЩs father, MAHARASHTRA who was behind the entire plan hurled casteist abuses at him and spit on him for having тАШthe audacityтАЩ to have a relationship with someone of higher class. After he was badly injured, he was left by the side of the road from where he was taken to the hospital. He gave up while treatment and embraced untimely death. Pimpri Chinchwad Police Commissioner Sandeep Bishnoi, verified the ghastly incident and certified the arrest of the four accused. The hateful casteism is present in every corner of India and it can be proved by other incidents.In Kerala, a young Dalit boy of 20 years was grievously injured with a sword. The injury was inflicted by the brother of the victimтАЩs lover who didnтАЩt approve of the relationship. Uttar Pradesh too was a spectator to casteism. In Amroha, UP, a 17-year-old teenage Dalit boy was shot to death in his sleep, at his own house over casteism. This young boy had a quarrel with a higher caste boy regarding going to the temple who took out his hatred and anger on this innocent soul. Generation old casteism has seeped like poison into the very labyrinth of society.Day after day, little by little humanity is getting eroded and nothing, not even a pandemic seems to evoke empathy in humans.

There is little gain-saying that Dalits have not suffered in India. They have been raped, murdered, discriminated against, distanced from wells and temples and thatтАЩs largely because upper-castes kept up the social barriers against them. The same utensils or glasses for both were out of question. Thus you canтАЩt quarrel with an Arundhati Roy (minorities-Dalits-living-in-fear); Shekhar Gupta (Dalits must suffer as they have over the millenniums and keep mouth shut); Rajdeep Sardesai (Access is not for Dalits); Barkha Dutt (the plight of Dalit women) or Sagarika Ghose (Upper-castes were bigger oppressors than the British) for they can back their claim with evidence. You also canтАЩt pick a quarrel with the BBC (Dalit killed for eating in front of upper-castes); New York Times (Dalits scalped); Washington Post (Lower caste chamar slur); or The London Times (Dalits and discrimination on horse-riding) for highlighting the divide. You also canтАЩt fault with politicians like Sonia Gandhi (horrified on Dalit atrocities); Rahul Gandhi (Dalits are beaten and crushed); Priyanka Gandhi (Dalits insult canтАЩt be tolerated); Mamata Banerjee (Organized crime against Dalits); Akhilesh Yadav (Dalits suppressed); Arvind Kejriwal (BJP has insulted Dalits); Asaduddin Owaisi (I ask Dalits to stop suffering) or Pinaryi Vijayan (Anti-Dalit politics by BJP) for they arguably are worried about the society. The angst of Dalit leaders like Mayawati, Prakash Ambedkar and Chandrashekhar Azad could also be understood. They are pained at the wrongs against their brothers and sisters. I may be missing the instances of Rana Ayyub, Saba Naqvi, The Wire, The Scroll, The Quint, The Print, The Squint, The Caravan, The Huffington Post etc but you get the drift. Now let me narrate a couple of instances of this week. Both instances occurred in Uttar Pradesh. In Jaunpur, houses of Dalit families were set ablaze by Muslims in Batheti village on Tuesday. According to police, the clashes erupted after two groups of Dalits and Muslim boys fought over cattle grazing. The village head tried to intervene but to no effect. Muslim boys returned with a bigger force, stones were pelted and these Muslims indulged in arson and set fire to Dalit huts. The second incident happened in Azamgarh on Friday. Sixteen Muslim youths attacked a group of Dalit men under Maharajganj police station. Twelve Dalit men were seriously injured. It occurred after Dalits objected to Muslim boys harassing some girls. One 22-year-old Sudhir was slashed with a sharp-edged weapon. Eleven others were badly beaten with sticks and stones. A rabid Muslim, anti-Hindu or anti-BJP person would claim that this is a manufactured narrative. That this Muslim violence wasnтАЩt because of caste-divide, never mind a few upper-caste violent acts against Dalits could similarly be over petty matters. Or they could ramble on what do you expect in a state of Yogi Adityanath. Or that these innocent Muslims have been framed by partisan police. Or that the state government has got another stick to beat the innocent, hapless Muslims with. That Hindu elements might have spread rumours for Dalits to confront Muslims and in consequence suffered physical and material losses. Or that this piece by me is a whataboutery to hide what regularly happens against Dalits by upper-caste Hindus. You could also cite the recent US State Department Report to shame present India. You could work out a few more excuses I might have missed out. LetтАЩs say I donтАЩt contest such an argument. LetтАЩs for a moment concede them the point. That these two specific incidents of Muslims against Dalits in Uttar Pradesh defy credulity. That Muslims can never beat Dalits. But the thrust of this piece is above this narrow binary. It is addressed to millions of Indians in this country, who are more than a Hindu or a Muslim, more than a BJP or a Congress, more than an Indian Express/The Hindu or a Republic TV which represent the two opposite sides of the spectrum. These Indians who hold the future of India in their neutrality. And the thrust is: Have you heard a Shekhar Gupta, Rajdeep Sardesai, Sagarika Ghose, Barkha Dutt, Saba Naqvi, Rana Ayyub, the Gandhis, Yadavs, Mamatas, Owaisis, Kejriwals and Vijayans say a word in condemnation against these two horrific incidents against Dalits? Or even from Mayawati, Prakash Ambedkar or Chandrashekhar Azad, the latter who often threatens to fast-unto-death in the cause of his Dalit community? Or Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi who wipe the tears of Dalits and photo-op with lunch on the same plate? The Wire, The Scroll, The Print, The Quint, Caravan or Huffington Post outraged? And if not, next time you quote them would you be honest and accept that these illustrious could be prejudiced and donтАЩt mind the ill of our beloved country? Or that you are prepared to sacrifice your next generation as long as you score a point on a Facebook debate? If these icons in media and politics fail this neutrality test, would you confess that they could be biased. That they are not neutral. That they could be propagandists. That they could be dangerous for society. For unity of India. Maybe paid for by forces which want India broken. For тАЬJewel of IndiaтАЭ which is still lusted for by foreign cabals. Those who thought India would break up in pieces and are distressed that it has survived 70-odd years and practices the best of democratic traditions? I donтАЩt suggest you believe me. It doesnтАЩt matter if I find currency with your or not. All I suggest is that next time you read these sources, pause. PAUSE AND REFLECT. Notice if you see any bias or prejudice. Hold them under microscope and see if you still find them neutral. If they fail the test, donтАЩt quote them next time. Make them honest; and not clink glasses on your back for having once against fooled you.

Shaadi.com, a marriage site for the Indian community in the UK, the US and elsewhere, is back in the headlines again. Originally, subscribers to the website were asked how dark or light their skin tone was тАУ it is commonly believed that a darker skin tone denotes a lower caste and that lighter skin tones are more desirable. Following the Black Lives Matter movement, a subscriber from the US started a petition to remove the colour filter from the website, and after garnering more than 1500 signatures in just 14 hours, Shaadi.com decided to remove it. While this is a victory, it is disturbing that several subscribers have reported that previously they were rejected by potential matches, based on their skin tone. Although the severity of caste discrimination suffered amongst the Diaspora in the west is milder in comparison to those in South Asia, there is obviously much that still has to be done to tackle both conscious and unconscious bias. On the bharatmatrimony.com website, it is still possible to search for partners by caste, and while many members in the UK add that caste is no bar to finding a suitable partner, not all of them do. For those who refuse to put their caste down, we do not know whether this is embarrassment or concern over not finding someone should they mention that they are a member of a Scheduled Caste, or whether it is because caste is genuinely not an issue that concerns them when looking for a spouse. Whether we like it or not, caste remains an identifier for some in the diaspora тАУ and skin tone just another method of making a judgement.

And so theyтАЩre only going to get more violence and intimidation.  тАЬDozen Dalit houses torched in UP communal clash, Yogi orders NSA against culprits,тАЭ New Indian Express, June 11, 2020: LUCKNOW: A brawl among children took a violent turn followed by communal tension in a village in Jaunpur district in eastern UP wherein over a dozen hutments owned by Dalits were set ablaze and massive damages were caused in 14 other houses of the members belonging to scheduled caste following a clash between two groups on late Wednesday night. While four persons sustained grievous injuries, three goats and a buffalo were burnt alive during the clash. Jaunpur police lodged a named FIR against 58 persons of one community under various IPC sections and also SC/ST Act. Moreover, cases were also lodged against 100 unidentified persons in connection with the clash. Taking cognizance of the incident, UP CM Yogi Adityanath ordered the district police authorities to invoke Gangster Act and impose National Security Act (NSA) against the main culprits тАУ Noor Alam and Javed Siddiqui тАУ who indulged in arson. The CM also issued a directive to take strict action against the SHO of the local police station as he failed to control the situationтАж. As per the local sources, some children from a locality dominated by scheduled caste members in Bhadethi village had taken their buffalos to the grazing field near a pond where children of other community were also present with their goats. The sources claimed that a buffalo while grazing, hit a goat and it led to a scuffle between the two groups of children. When they returned to their homes and narrated the incident to their parents, people of one community armed with sticks and rods thronged the Dalit locality. After an exchange of heated arguments, scuffle ensued in which Nabeel, Lareb, and Habib got injured. At the same time, Aftab aka Hitler, husband of Bhadethi village head, intervened and pacified both the groups. However, around 8 pm, over 100 persons of one community raided the Dalit Basti again and attacked the locals injuring Ravi, Atul, and Pawan. In the melee, the assailants started ransacking the houses of Dalits. Nandlal, Nebulal, Firtu, Rajaram, Jitendra, Sewlal and many others lost their belongings as their shanties were set afire by attackersтАж.    mortimer says Jun 13, 2020 at 3:19 pm But the lame-stream media give Muslims a moral FREE-PASS by covering up and SPIKING such stories about Islamist atrocities. The unwritten rule the Red-Green Axis observes is to never say anything negative about Islam or Muslims, no matter how viciously or brutally or barbarically the Muslims behave. This double standard is visible whenever disasters involving Muslims occur. If Muslims are victims, itтАЩs declared to be the end of civilization тАж no amount of ink is enough to denounce those who attack Muslims. However, if Muslims are the perpetrators and victimizers, then the media donтАЩt want anyone in the West to know about it. THOSE atrocities get spiked. TruthSeeker says Jun 13, 2020 at 3:53 pm Violence is the language spoken by the Muslims everywhere. Yet the leftist controlled mass media serves as a mouthpiece to paint the Muslims as the most persecuted people. Not to forget peace loving too. Anyone who speaks up to confront this false narrative is called anti Muslim or divisive. Dude says Jun 13, 2020 at 4:12 pm Ahah, seems they got their goat. Careful, these arenтАЩt the same Hindu koala bears your ancestors pillaged. Modi will put everything right. The mohammedans are writing their own ticket outta town. Good riddance тАУ at last. ronit says Jun 14, 2020 at 1:58 am The person in the photo Yogi Adityanath is the Chief Minister of that state, and is the 2nd most hated person(after modi) by the Muslims, because he knows how to deal with them. All those Muslims who did this have been charged under National Security ActтАж where extremely stringent punishment is given. DHazard says Jun 13, 2020 at 4:24 pm There is a word I hate, used by PC types, that applies here. As usual, there is also a clear double standard among those people favoring the тАЬfinalтАЭ religion over all others, especially Jews and Christians. The word is тАЬotheringтАЭ. Just as Muslim тАЬscientistsтАЭ didnтАЩt really invent anything new during the Muslim Golden Age, Muslims didnтАЩt invent the concept of othering. ItтАЩs called xenophobia and has been around since humanity and may be biologically hardwired into us. Fear of strangers usually manifests as hatred and Muslims donтАЩt deviate from this likelihood. Shan Barani says Jun 13, 2020 at 9:13 pm Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh will take care of this He has a long history of street-fighting for decades against Muslim goons His police have shot hundreds of Muslim criminals In the town of Kairana, which was being ethnic cleansed of Hindus by Muslims, Yogi police reversed the situation Because the victims are Dalits, Indian laws provide for extra penalty and Yogi has used this law against muslim rioters repeatedly gravenimage says Jun 13, 2020 at 9:39 pm India: Muslim mob menaces Dalits with sticks, burns down a dozen Dalit houses, causes massive damage to 14 others тАжтАжтАжтАжтАжтАж Absolutely horrifying. And this also give the lie to the claim sometimes made by re India that it is actually Muslims who are the friends of Dalits (the former тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ) because Islam is supposedly so egalitarian. Just a sick joke. The Hindu Kaffir says Jun 14, 2020 at 1:07 am Yogi Ji is the Hindu saviourтАж latha says Jun 14, 2020 at 3:45 am Why jihadwatch is not reporting this ? Retired District and Sessions judge from Haryana, Pawan Kumar, has submitted a report which says : At the village Ferozepur Namak, a woman was abducted under the pretext of a job offer. For several days, nine Muslims including one Yusuf gangraped her. A named-FIR against the perpetrators was registered under IPC section 376 (rape), but the police did not take any action. The woman was admitted to a hospital after which she was killed. The police took no action in this FIR either, which was filed under IPC section 302 (murder), and instead passed it off as suicide. A Dalit girl from Mewali village was abducted by a boy named Sajid on 8 February, 2020; the girl has not been traced till date. One Nizam, son of Isar, along with his accomplices, abducted a Dalit girl at gunpoint. An FIR was registered but the girl was forced to make a statement that she had eloped and married at her own will and converted to Islam. In Mewat villages, Dalit girls are routinely molested on streets. Obscene acts are committed in their presence, and attempts are made to abduct them. Due to this, the Dalit girls either do not go to school or even if they go, they give up their studies midway. A Dalit girl from Sheikhpur village has been missing for the past several months. At the time of marriage of a Valmiki woman from village Siroli, 15 Muslim men beat up the bridegroom. They tried to abduct the bride but the village youths managed to stop them.Demolishing and looting of marriage pavilions on the occasion of marriage of Dalit girls has become a common occurrence in Mewat. One Junaid from Ghasera village kidnapped the mother of two children, and forcibly married her. He is now pressuring both her minor girls to convert to Islam. The father even makes the girls watch obscene messages on his phone. A minor Dalit girl of Nuh village was kidnapped and gangraped by four Muslim men. This abominable crime was committed in the house of a Muslim policeman. There has been no action in the FIR which was registered on 7 July, 2019. The judge then listed out six cases of alleged atrocities on Dalit men: Ramjilal, a resident of village Bichhor, was brutally beaten up by one Iqbal, who is father of the woman sarpanch of that village. Iqbal, along with his accomplices, cut open RamjilalтАЩs stomach, filled it with cotton and burnt him alive. No action was taken even after the registration of named FIR. The police declared it to be a death due to lightning bolt. On 20 April, 2020, one Haneef, along with his 10-12 accomplices, kidnapped a Dalit youth from his home at village Chundika. They beat up the youth with rods and sticks and left only when they thought he was dead. Despite registration of FIR, no action has been taken so far. Instead, pressure is being built on the complainant to retract or they would face a false case. That Dalit boyтАЩs only fault was that he had asked for his borrowed money back. The plots allotted to the Dalits in village Kiranj were captured by Kamruddin, along with his accomplices, and till date no action has been taken on the complaint of the victims. On April 21, 2020, Atees along with his 10-15 accomplices, blocked the way of one Rahul, who is resident of village Puleta. The group hurled caste slurs at him and assaulted his family. The police overlooked the provisions of the SC/ST Act without investigation and did not take any action. On April 7, 2020, one Asif thrashed Yogesh, a resident of village Nagina, with a stick at the latterтАЩs chemist shop, while Sakir took away Rs 22,200 from his drawer at gunpoint. Despite the FIR, no action has been taken. Yunus was distributing ration at his shop at Bisru village, where 25-30 men were standing there as a crowd. Vinod, a Dalit boy, who works as a watchman, asked them to maintain social distancing to prevent spread of COVID-19. But then one Arif abused him with caste slurs. The police have not taken any action yet. The judge also said that out of some 500 villages in Mewat, 103 have become totally devoid of Hindus while 82 villages have only four-five Hindu families left. Kumar said that these figures are based on statements by villagers. He also narrated a case of a Dalit youth named Pravin from Nangal Mubarikpur village who was тАЬtrickedтАЭ to become a Muslim and now his wife and children are being pressured to convert too. тАЬAs many as 205 Valmiki families have converted to Islam by force since 1996,тАЭ he said, adding that this number, again, is based on statements by villagers. In the conclusion, the report says, тАЬIt is the conclusion of this inquiry committee that the life of Dalit community in Mewat today has become thorny and unbearable. Their religion, their real-estates and wealth, dignity of their womenfolk and nothing else are safe today. Even after 73 years of independence, they have not been truly independentтАжтАЭ The report also says that such atrocities are not possible without the collusion of the police administration. https://swarajyamag.com/politics/aurangzeb-like-brutal-atrocities-are-being-committed-on-dalits-in-mewat-says-retired-judge-from-haryana Women who come there after marriage should be sent to the Sheikh for 3 days for him and his men to keep them before restoring them. Haryana is ruled by ModiтАЩs so called Hindu party BJP which is blamed by US Congress. The Guardian, NYT, WP etc as enemy of muslims. The above report is only a sample. There is ample. Jayell says Jun 14, 2020 at 5:57 am тАЬEven after 73 years of independence, they have not been truly independentтАжтАЭтАжтАж The separation of India and Pakistan in 1947 was supposed to stop a lot of this sort of thing happening. WhatтАЩs gone wrong? UVG says Jun 29, 2020 at 4:40 am India never enforced nor stood for a full exchange of population with Pakistan. In the annals of history may people remember that India tried hard to make amends with Islam. Maybe the Hindu dictum of тАЬVasudhaiv KutumbukamтАЭ is an idiotic, emotional and timid feature of the Indian civilizational ethos. But IndianтАЩs continue to venerate this dictum to date. Thankfully today people are able to cut through niceties and call a spade a spade. gravenimage says Jun 14, 2020 at 11:39 pm latha, you can send this story to Robert Spencer at the тАЬContact UsтАЭ box at the right side of the page. latha says Jun 15, 2020 at 6:43 am gravenimage, WouldnтАЩt he read these comments ? Khushi says Jun 14, 2020 at 6:19 am Muslim politicians are busy shouting slogans of тАЬJai Bhim, Jai MeemтАЭ, which roughly translates to тАЬMuslims and Dalits are oneтАЭ; meaning that muslims and Dalits have to unite against and defeat upper caste Hindus. But this story above is the real truth about muslims тАУ they hate Dalits as much as they hate all non-muslims. They befriend Dalits only to defeat upper caste Hindus. gravenimage says Jun 14, 2020 at 11:41 pm Yes. Muslims are trying to use Dalits in India just as they are trying to use Blacks in the US. Ramesh B says Jun 14, 2020 at 10:50 pm Taquia or deception. First they act as if they want peace and make an agreement. Once they fool people , later, they come back and attack. They have been doing this for centuries as ordained in their book. UVG says Jun 29, 2020 at 4:42 am Reminds me of the Chinese. Perhaps dictators driven by different ideology behave in the same ways.

He said the statue of Manu is тАШan insult to the Indian Constitution as well as Dalits, women and all those who believe in equality and justiceтАЩ. According to Hindu mythology, Manu is the progenitor of mankind and the author of the controversial тАШManusmritiтАЩ, which codifies the rights and duties of various social groups. Macwan wrote that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in Manusmriti. The text is known to have formalised regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. тАЬMoreover, the law of Manu stands in total contradiction to what the Indian Constitution has committed itself to, while the latter upholds equality and fraternity, social justice and freedom, the former indulges in archaic teaching about inequality and social segregation, hierarchy and division, injustice and servitude. тАЬThat this country has tolerated this contradiction for 73 years post-Independence is testimony to our failure to live by the invaluable heritage of the Constitution bequeathed to us by Dr Ambedkar and the Constitution-makers,тАЭ the letter said. The statue, built in 1989 by the Rajasthan Judicial Officers Association, has withstood several protests, court cases and even an order by judges to remove it. Members of the Navsarjan Trust have given an ultimatum to the Congress government in Rajasthan, stating that if the statue is not removed by August 15, they will call for an agitation.

The deceased have been identified as Kishan Lal (52), and his son Rajesh (22). The father's body was found inside the house, while the son's body was found about 200 metres away from the house. According to police, 10 to 15 people barged into the victims' house and attacked the family members, killing the father and son on the spot. Two of the accused have been arrested in this connection. The bodies were sent for post mortem and the report is awaited. In her complaint, Kishan Lal's daughter Gudiya, said that neighbours used to fight with her family over a property dispute. On Saturday, a mob of 10 to 15 people barged into her house and attacked her brother Rajesh, who was mentally unstable, and her father, who was unwell. Majhola police station SHO Rakesh Kumar Singh said, ""The accused had fled the spot before police reached there. The bodies have been sent for post mortem."" Moradabad superintendent of police (SP) Amit Anand said, ""The father-son duo died after they were repeatedly attacked with bricks. An FIR has been registered under section 304 (punishable for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

A screenshot from a video of Kashinath Talwar being assaulted. New Delhi: A Dalit man was thrashed by a mob, allegedly as he had тАЬtouchedтАЭ a two-wheeler vehicle of an upper caste man in KarnatakaтАЩs Vijayapura district. According to the New Indian Express, Kashinath Talwar, a 28-year-old daily wager was going to work with his father in Minajgi village in Vijayapura on Saturday. A group of villagers thrashed him, accusing him of merely touching a motorcycle that was owned by an upper-caste person, which was parked near Chennamma Circle, says the complaint filed by TalwarтАЩs father Yankappa. A video that has surfaced on social media shows a crowd raining blows on the man, as others hold him. Yankappa stated that the crowd also assaulted him and his sonтАЩs wife and daughter when they tried to rescue Kashinath. тАЬThe men used offensive words against our caste and threatened to set our community houses on fire,тАЭ Talwar stated in his complaint, which has been registered at the Talikoti police station. The local police have registered a complaint under the SC/ST Atrocities Act, but no arrests have been made yet. Thirteen people had been named in the complaint, NDTV reported. A Karnataka police officer Anupam Aggarwal said that the villagers also filed a counter-FIR against Talwar. тАЬWhen an investigation team reached the site of the incident today, they were told that he was beaten up when he took out his clothes and started showing his private parts to two girls who were washing clothes. We have registered a counter case under section 354 of the IPC,тАЭ he told NDTV. In several cases, counter-FIRs are filed by the police to force victims of caste atrocities to either back down or come to a compromise. Writing for NewsClick, Parth M.N. reported recently that in Beed town of Maharashtra, after a Dalit woman filed a complaint against a lawyer for physical and sexual abuse, a counter-FIR was registered against the victim within hours. The lawyerтАЩs wife accused three men and the Dalit woman of attempting to gangrape her. The three men named in the FIR helped the Dalit woman file her complaint, one of them was a local journalist. тАЬThis counter FIR is to harass us for the help we extended to the woman,тАЭ the journalist said, according to the report. The Dalit woman said the lawyer, an тАШinfluential manтАЩ in the town was offering to withdraw the complaint if she withdraws herтАЩs. тАЬI am being pressured,тАЭ she said. Recently, many incidents of violence against Dalits have been reported in the media. Last Friday, reports said a 27-year-old Dalit man was killed by six upper caste men in Gujarat. Pintu Galchar, a resident of Ravi village in Dhanera taluka of Banaskantha district was allegedly abducted from outside his house by a group of six men around 10 pm on July 16. He was later found dead, with his body showing gruesome injuries. In Madhya PradeshтАЩs Guna, a Dalit couple died by suicide after the police destroyed their crops as part of an тАШanti-encroachmentтАЩ drive. Visuals of the coupleтАЩs children holding their dead bodies and weeping were flashed on television screens across the country, causing outrage. In June, a report said that since the imposition of the coronavirus lockdown, caste atrocities had increased nearly fivefold in Tamil Nadu.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

An online video showing half a dozen police officers dragging and beating the couple with sticks to evict them from government-owned land in central Madhya Pradesh state has been viewed more than 1 million times since it took place on Tuesday.  рд╣рдорд╛рд░реА рд▓рдбрд╝рд╛рдИ рдЗрд╕реА рд╕реЛрдЪ рдФрд░ рдЕрдиреНрдпрд╛рдп рдХреЗ рдЦрд╝рд┐рд▓рд╛рдлрд╝ рд╣реИред pic.twitter.com/egGjgY5Awm The couple consumed pesticide moments after the eviction and were rushed to hospital, S. Vishwanath, head of the local administration, told a news conference late on Wednesday, hours before he and the police chief were removed from their posts. ""To force a couple to attempt suicide by damaging their crops ... is most cruel and shameful,"" Kumari Mayawati, a Dalit political leader, said on Twitter. ""Nationwide condemnation of the incident is natural. Government should take strict action."" Government and senior police officials were not immediately available for comment. The eviction was part of a drive to stop encroachment on land and the area the couple was farming had been allotted for the construction of a college, said a policeman who declined to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Six police officers were suspended on Thursday and the state government has ordered an investigation into the incident. India banned discrimination based on caste - a system which divided Hindus into groups based on occupations - in 1955. But centuries-old biases against lower-caste groups persist, making it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes. A growing population and rising pressure on land to build homes, highways and industry is triggering conflicts, with lower-caste citizens often facing eviction, particularly in rural areas where biases are most entrenched, campaigners say. More than half of India's lower-caste population is landless, according to census data. Several states have laws aimed at giving land to Dalits but few have produced results, according to Dalit activists and leaders. ""They were begging the police to not destroy their crops as they were in debt ... but the police did not listen to them,"" N. Kumar, a neighbour of the couple, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Nankhedi village. He said the couple had asked the police to wait two months so that they could harvest their crops. Ram Prakash Sharma, a tribal and Dalits' rights activist in Madhya Pradesh, described the incident as ""unfortunate"" and urged authorities to do more to help the couple. ""The Dalits in Madhya Pradesh are one of the most backward people and they do not own farming land,"" he said. ""The government must provide this couple a house and employment so that they can feed their kids and not die of starvation.""

A video has been widely shared of the police appearing to beat the pair in the state of Madhya Pradesh, as their distraught children cry nearby. Opposition parties say it is typical of the treatment of Dalits, who are at the bottom of the Hindu caste system. Despite laws to protect them, they still face widespread discrimination. A video shows the police hitting a Dalit man with batons as his wife and others try to save him. The couple said they had leased the land for farming and would die if they were evicted.

Dakshayani, who passed away on this day (July 20) in 1978, was the only Dalit woman member of the Constituent Assembly of India. There are many firsts associated with the life of Dakshayani Velayudhan. To start with, she was the first Dalit woman graduate of India. The contemporary narrative of gender in India hardly encapsulates the Dalit component, regardless of having such towering personalities who defied conventional wisdom and led a revolution in their own realm. Recounting her initial days of struggle, Dakshayani had said, тАЬI was the only girl student for B.Sc Chemistry or for any science subjects in the college. It was тАШsheer luckтАЩ to get higher education. (In the laboratory) an upper caste teacher did not show me experiments тАФ I learnt things by looking from a distance and graduated with a high second class in 1935. In July 1935, I was posted as an L-2 teacher in the High School Peringothikara in Trichur District.тАЭ It is important to confront such hard realities that are still being faced by Dalits across the country. Inspired by Ayyankali тАФ one of the greatest social reformers of the 20th century, Dakshayani set out on the journey to address the civilisational fault lines of our society. There are many firsts associated with the life of Dakshayani Velayudhan. (Photo: Facebook/ Meera Velayudhan) The group of men and women who drafted the Indian Constitution were people of great eminence with vision and foresight. Being the only Dalit woman in that congregation is a remarkable indication of a social revolution at multiple levels. At the young age of 34, Dakshayani not only made herself heard in the premier decision-making body of the country, but also ensured that the opinion of the marginalised was accounted for. The intellectual establishment in the post-independent India overworked to promote a single individual, and thereafter a family, to determine them as the sole custodian of the claim over the Independence struggle. The sheer amount of academic investment in promoting Nehru and the Nehru-Gandhi family reeks of a deeper conspiracy to progressively obliterate the insurmountable contributions of the galaxy of other leaders of the freedom struggle. Dakshayani is one such victim along with many other unsung leaders, who will be gone from the pages of history textbooks. Dakshayani Velayudhan (top right corner) тАФ the only Dalit woman member of the Constituent Assembly тАФ with the rest of the women members of the Assembly. (Photo: Centre for WomenтАЩs Studies). On her 42nd death anniversary today, we must remember her noteworthy contributions and initiate a public conversation on the status of Dalit women in the country who are facing the double whammy of caste and gender every day. In one of her earlier speeches in the Cochin Legislative Council, Dakshayani voiced her concerns for the depressed classes. She said that unless untouchability was legally abolished and supplemented with strong welfare measures for the upliftment of the marginalised, the usage of the term тАШHarijanтАЩ for them is like addressing dogs as Napoleon. тАШHarijanтАЩ was a patronising term then and it still is now. As someone from the fraternity, I assert that the community as a whole must be a key stakeholder in determining suitable terminologies for themselves. Every term has a trajectory and a journey that is telling of evolving circumstances. Depressed classes, Scheduled Caste, Harijan and now Dalits. Dalit represents an assertion and a will to be heard. The new-age Dalit struggle is no longer limited to a seat in government-sponsored educational institutions and employment. The life and times of Dakshayani need to be studied to generate intellectual curiosity towards the struggles and rise of Dalit women. The Dalit movement today is ill-advisedly stuck in the past. With the Constitution as a fundamental document, Dalits across the country must have a sense of ownership not only because of Ambedkar, but also because of leaders like Dakshayani, Babu Jagjivan Ram and many other leaders who ensured a safe, secure and a sustainable future for the subalterns. Dignity, respect and equality in everyday interaction are what the new-age Dalit women and men like me aspire for. The civil society, political class and the academic establishments must realise this and be willing to share positions for the socially-marginalised and historically oppressed people in the structures of power and privilege.

Speaking to The Kashmir Walla, sarpanch Kamlesh Kumari said that she was consistently disrespected for her identity as a Dalit. тАЬAll the people in there [BDC] who are upper caste including some panches, DC, chairman, disrespected me, [taunted me by] calling me Dalit,тАЭ she alleged. In a statement issued earlier, Ms. Kumari stated that she resigned тАЬafter bearing brunt of atrocities and hatred based discrimination by upper-caste Hindus particularly towards schedule caste and finding no safeguards from the caste-based ruling elite coupled with stigmas inflicted upon the undersigned and my family by the upper caste Hindus i.e.; Block Developmental chairman Kishtwar Shri Suresh Sharma, BDO Kishtwar Shri Sheetal Sharma, JE (Junior Engineer, RDD Block) Kishtwar Shri Vijay Parihar and also in view of sustained life threats to me and my family and outgoing burnt of caste-based hatred and corruption in the system in Jammu and Kashmir (UT) in general and District Kishtwar, in particular, I am going to resign from my services as Sarpanch today on and therefore I cease to be Sarpanch with immediate effect.тАЭ Ms. Kumari said that matters became worse after she objected to alleged corruption in the BDC. тАЬFor the past 5-6 months, I have been speaking out against corruption. My panches were paid less money,тАЭ she said. тАЬWhen I filed an FIR against the chairman for enquiry, all of them (upper-caste Hindu men) came together and started threatening me.тАЭ Following the alleged threats, Ms. Kumari said that she is worried about her and the familyтАЩs safety. тАЬMy kids and my husband are also worried. From last one month, I have not been able to go anywhere because they were threatening me and then I thought resignation is the best option,тАЭ she said. Ajit Bhagat, Ms. KumariтАЩs husband, accused the JEPD chairmanтАЩs involvement in the corruption within the panchayat, particularly in the disbursement of wages under the rural employment generation scheme. Mr. Bhagat said that the discrimination was not limited to just the Dalit community but Muslims as well. тАЬWhen it was time for the payment, there was an upper-caste Junior Engineer,тАЭ who, he said. there are two wards [represented by] upper caste Hindus to which they paid 16000 17000 rupees while the three wards by Muslims and Dalits were being paid 2000 and 3000 rupees,тАЭ he said. Mr. Bhagat further alleged that this was why Ms. Kumari was harassed. тАЬThe upper caste Brahmins tortured [Ms. Kumari],тАЭ Mr. Bhagat told The Kashmir Walla. тАЬI canтАЩt even say how much. When she used to walk, they criticized her like kids. This is a dispute from the past 4-5 months.тАЭ The BDC chairperson Mr. Sharma, however, denied the allegations against him. тАЬAll the accusations are baseless,тАЭ he said. тАЬI am BDC chairman of 12 panchayats, we keep an eye on every panchayat. She had no issues with me, she had issues with the panches and the ward members of her village. She has an uncle who is a sarpanches and her sister-in-law who is a panches, they bring their personal issues here. They did not get along with the panches and they are maligning the whole RDE department and the BDC chairman.тАЭ Ms. Kumari, in her statement, had also stated that тАЬI am much dedicated towards my work and never surrender before the evil. For the last couple of months, I am continuously pressurized by the BDC chairman Kishtwar namely Suresh Sharma for doing the corrupt practices. But when I categorically refused to indulge myself in corrupt practice as my moral do not allow me to violate the norms of PRI [Panhayati Raj Institution], lateral BDC chairman Kishtwar Suraish Sharma called me in his office in presence of BDO KCSM ishtwar Sheetal Sharma and other panches and curse me on the basis of my caste and use (sic) unparliamentary language to demolish my modesty, even he physically hit me publically and called me as untouchable and the BDO Kishtwar Sheetal Sharma and other officials remain mere spectators. The written complaint had been filed against BDC chairman at Police station Kishtwar and other offices of higher authorities but no stagnant action has been taken yet as the administrative machinery of district Kishtwar work on the mercy of these politically affiliated persons.тАЭ Ms. Kumari said that the constant harassment has put тАЬa huge stressтАЭ on her resulting in тАЬcardiac disorderтАЭ, and тАЬa state of depressionтАЭ on her family. Through the statement, she has held BDC chairman Suresh Sharma, BJP District President Pardeep Parihar and BDO Kishtwar Sheetal Sharma responsible for in case тАЬI and my family is physically or mentally effected/harmed (sic)тАЭ.

Historically, Indian cinema exploited the labour of Dalits in its making, whilst erasing or appropriating their stories. This was not an accidental practice. When their stories were told on screen, it would be by savarnas who also played their characters with patriarchal, sexist and casteist undertones. The scenario has slowly changed, and the identity of Dalit characters in cinema тАФ directed by a Dalit (and a few non-Dalit) filmmakers тАФ has become explicit, transcending boundaries of caste and class. These filmmakers have helped shape visual storytelling that combines тАЬjustice with aestheticsтАЭ. тАЬJustice with aestheticsтАЭ was rarely present in cinema made by savarnas, or it was seldom honest. Dalit-Bahujan filmmakers have filled this gap, while creating a new wave of cinema that is more appealing to a Dalit-Bahujan audience. In this series, we examine 10 Indian films that count not only among the finest cinema the country has produced, but are also intertwined with justice, politics, and aesthetic. *** When I was five or six, my father тАФ then a driver and a movie buff тАФ would take me to watch Bollywood films every Sunday at single screen theatres across Nagpur. For me, entering those darkened cinema halls was like entering a new world, one that seemed alien from my real world тАФ a Dalit basti and the harsh life there. That sense of alienation stayed with me for a long time. I came to Mumbai in 2013 to pursue an MA. The very next year was when Nagraj ManjuleтАЩs Fandry was released. I wasn't a fan of Marathi cinema, but having heard about the film from a few people, decided to watch it in the theatre. It was the most beautiful and nuanced cinematic imagination I had ever witnessed unfolding in a film hall. Did everyone feel the same after watching Fandry? Of course not. Why? Because, viewers in India watch cinema with the baggage of our caste, and our experience of a film depends on how our caste-conditioning makes us see the world. For me, after watching Fandry, the alienation I had felt for so long in relation to cinema came to an end. Fandry brought many тАШIтАЩs on screen, giving them the confidence, personality and purpose that had been ripped from us by Bollywood movies. * In 1913, Dadasaheb Phalke, a Marathi Brahmin also known as тАЬthe father of Indian cinemaтАЭ, made the first Indian feature film: Raja Harishchandra. It was a silent motion picture. Almost all of PhalkeтАЩs movies are based on a Hindu-Brahminical mythological imagination of India and its society. The initiation of the Hindu-Brahmin myth into cinema technology was not accidental: Phalke тАФ being a Brahmin whose social position meant having very little contact with a vast swathe of society and its stories тАФ grew up alienated from the pains and virtues of the masses. This alienation reflected in nearly all Marathi directors and their movies. Only a handful of movies were truly тАЬsensibleтАЭ, in aesthetic and politics. However, all were products of the Brahminical imagination; caste as a cultural location in their cinema was subverted, manipulated and often appropriated as per convenience. Nothing changed on these lines for a hundred years in Marathi cinema. Then Fandry was released in 2014. Its frames, camera angles, screenplay, background music, storytelling, noises, even silence тАФ all broke rules Marathi cinema had followed thus far. As I got up from my seat in the theatre after the final scene тАФ as the stone pelted by the protagonist Jabya fills the entire screen тАФ I felt numb, speechless. It took me a while to realise just how enriching the experience of watching a work of art can be. Fandry is undisputedly among the masterpieces in the world cinema: Not because it has a Dalit protagonist or director, but for the way it translates social reality into cinematic imagination. Great cinema helps the masses to integrate in it, it appeals to their pain, virtues and aesthetics; it isnтАЩt servile to the tastes of a few bourgeoisie. It is these qualities that make Fandry a cinematic masterpiece. Still from Nagraj Manjule's Fandry (2014) Interestingly, the early movies of Raj Kapoor had some Leftist or liberal undercurrents тАФ largely because those screenplays were written by Left-leaning screenwriters and their immortal songs were written by Shailendra, a Dalit, whose profound lyrics are unparalleled. In Fandry, the camera is neither sympathetic nor pitiful towards its protagonist, nor is it artificially rebellious. It is anxious; it is beautiful; it is in search of a dream; it aspires to be normal amid abnormal caste-realities. It is not larger than life, but it is life тАФ one paralysed by the society and cunningly defamed in cinema in India. This life, the life of Dalits, is revived and provided a meaning in the cinematic imagination for the first time in India. Fandry re-introduces a hero who is тАЬdeadтАЭ in history and erased by cinema from the lives of people. So far, Indian cinema had chosen to remain in ignorance when it comes to Dalit lives. Out of pity, in a few movies (from the parallel cinema movement) some facts or behaviour about Dalit lives were portrayed by savarna directors тАФ that too negatively. Frantz Fanon writes in his book Black Skin, White Mask: тАЬWhat is essential to us is not to accumulate facts and behaviour, but to bring out their meaning.тАЭ Fandry brought out the meanings of Dalit life. It is beyond any political state ideology. FandryтАЩs protagonist Jabya, or Jambuwant Kachru Mane, is a dreamer, a man of letters, a lover and more importantly, sensitive to the world around him. This does not mean he is submissive. He is smart, hardworking and aspires to follow his dreams, his love. But his caste-reality fractures the wheel of his aspirations. He has to respond to it. When Jabya is subjected to humiliation, he remains calm and tolerant. But he is, in the climax, humiliated in front of his love, school mates. Moreover, his sisters are too humiliated and despised for their тАЬsmellтАЭ. This is what he cannot tolerate and responds with aggression тАФ with a stone cast towards his upper caste harassers in the film. Jabya is an uncommon protagonist because no Indian filmmaker had previously put the centrality of a movie in a Dalit man. In Fandry, a Dalit man arrives at a vision of life, and through his eyes, the audience sees the world, now and thereafter. Herein lies the brilliance of Nagraj Manjule. Fandry revived Marathi cinema. Apart from its stellar cinematic language, Fandry speaks to us as an enigmatic poem whose purpose is to teach us about the value of life, make us feel the agonies that our ignorance about each other begets, and destroy the false consciousness that the cultural industry has created throughout so many years and decades. Fandry is also a rigorous cinematic exercise for us as viewers to contemplate on: what kind of society we have become; what kind of cinema this society has produced; and what kind of society cinema has constructed, in which a man is denied love just because he is Dalit. When I look back on the day I watched Fandry for the first time, I feel that something in me changed forever in relation to cinema. I knew then that no matter how small it may be, but I too have a space in the cinematic imagination of this country. I know that whenever people like me watch Fandry, they too feel that they are telling their story to a world which ignored them so far. * Yogesh Maitreya is a poet, translator and founder of Panther's Paw Publication, an anti-caste publishing house.

The incident has now snowballed into a major controversy after video of the act went viral on social media. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati on Tuesday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a high-level inquiry into the incident. In a tweet, Mayawati said, ""In UP near Agra, the body of a Dalit woman was removed from the cremation ground by people of upper castes having casteist mentality because the cremation ghat belonged to upper castes. This is most shameful and most condemnable."" In another tweet, she said, ""In this casteist and most disgusting incident, a high-level inquiry should be conducted by the UP government and the culprits should be given harshest punishment so that such incidents are not repeated in the future. This is the demand of the BSP."" The body of the 26-year old woman was removed from the funeral pyre in Agra about a week ago by the Thakur community who said this cremation ground is not meant for people from Dalit community. Mayawati also raised the issue of the death of a Dalit doctor in Delhi who died due to coronavirus.

The suspension followed the transfer of Guna District Collector S Vishwanathan and Superintendent of Police Tarun Nayak late Wednesday. On Tuesday afternoon, a couple of hours after a bulldozer began destroying the soybean crop on their land, Rajkumar Ahirwar and his wife Savitri consumed pesticide. While authorities alleged the couple had encroached on the 45-bigha plot meant for a government college, their relatives said Ahirwar had taken the land on lease from one Gabbu Pardhi and had even raised a loan to cultivate soybean. Sources said the couple had requested the anti-encroachment team to give them time till their crop was harvested but when the bulldozers rolled in, Savitri rushed inside their hut and consumed pesticide. A few minutes later, Rajkumar, 38, too followed her. Officials alleged that when they tried to take the unconscious couple to hospital, RajkumarтАЩs younger brother Shishupal and other relatives blocked them, leading to a lathi charge. The coupleтАЩs condition is stable. Read | MP Dalit coupleтАЩs suicide bid while resisting eviction from land: Here is what happened Photographs and videos of the incident went viral тАУ some showing the coupleтАЩs six children crying next to their unconscious parents, and others with police raining blows and kicking Shishupal and a woman who tries to shield him. The Opposition Congress slammed the BJP government, with former CM Kamal Nath saying the incident is proof of тАЬjungle rajтАЭ in the state. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had ordered an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the suicide bid and the lathi charge. A magisterial probe has been ordered too. The State Human Rights Commission has asked for a report from the IG (Gwalior) and the Collector within three weeks. Among the six policemen suspended on Thursday are Sub-Inspector Ashok Singh Kushwah; constables Rajendra Sharma, Pawan Yadav and Narendra Rawat; and women constables Neetu Yadav and Rani Raghuvanshi. They have been told not to leave the headquarters without permission. On Thursday, IG (Gwalior Range) Rajababu Singh was also transferred but the government did not say if the shift had anything to do with the incident in Guna, a district thatтАЩs part of the Gwalior range. Government sources said the IGтАЩs transfer was in connection with the upcoming by-elections since most of the constituencies fall in the region. While the videos show a woman constable raining blows on Shishupal and the woman, senior officials claimed Shishupal had attacked the woman constable. Posting a video of the police action, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday tweeted, тАЬHamari ladai isi soch aur anyay ke khilaf hai (Our fight is against this very mentality and injustice)тАЭ. The Congress announced it would send a seven-member team led by former home minister Bala Bachchan and former urban development minister Jaivardhan Singh to Guna on Friday. A Congress team met the couple at the district hospital on Thursday and handed them a cheque of Rs 1.5 lakh. Accusing the Congress of conspiring to create tension, state BJP president V D Sharma said the incident had no caste angle but was a dispute between encroachers and a team from the administration. Bamori in Guna district is one of the 25 constituencies where bypolls crucial to the survival of the BJP government will be held. Most of these seats fall in the Gwalior-Chambal region that was rocked by violence in April 2018 in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

"400",3876,"https://www.dalitcamera.com/hindutva-dalits-tribals-north-bengal/","The burgeoning presence of Hindutva identity amongst the tribal and dalit communities of North Bengal","One of the most astounding examples of RSS helping create an ideological shift through its educational policies in a region, is its work done in BengalтАЩs famous Naxal cradle , the Naxalbari. Schools like Sarada Vidyamandir, in Naxalbari are examples of RSSтАЩs ideological expansion in places historically known for radical leftist movements . Written by Arko Dev Sinha| Bagdogra|July 20, 2020 RSS, arguably the most powerful right wing group and the ideological parent of the BJP, has grown in leaps and bounds amongst Dalit and Adivasi dominated North Bengal in the past few decades and has helped visibly replace the traditional left and its allies as the main opposition to the ruling Trinamool Congress in the Northern half of West Bengal. The Lok Sabha constituency of Cooch Behar (SC) and the constituency of Alipurduar (ST) for the first time ever saw themselves being taken over by candidates fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections toppling the sitting Trinamool Congress candidates in the respective districts . Historically the seats have voted for RSP and Forward Bloc candidates in Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts respectively until 2014 . The sudden shift in electoral preferences of the local tribal and Dalit communities to a political party that perpetuates an ideology fuelled by a form of casteist and anti-tribal brahminical hinduism is quite intriguing, hence raising a lot of questions regarding the sociopolitical aspirations of these oppressed communities. These marginalised communities , although fond of their rich culture and heritage , choose to vote for groups seeking to destroy their identities and appropriate their struggle in its oppressive hindutva narratives, because of the underdevelopment and impoverishment faced in the hands of their previous political representatives. Given their miserable situation, they are now willing to vote even for the ones providing them with false expectations. RSS and itтАЩs growing presence in North Bengal The BJP helped gain pace in these areas oweing to the extensive work done over a decade to create a road map for the party by Madhav bhawan , the RSS head quarter of North Bengal in Siliguri alongside the 500 plus shakhas spread across тАЬUttar BangaтАЭ. RSS traditionally had a socio-political grasp over the southern districts of Bengal. However in North Bengal, despite being present in the region for over two decades, RSS could only garner enough political support for the BJP post 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The expansion of the Sangh in the region can be mostly attributed towards its policies of tapping in to the numerous tea workersтАЩ unions through its very own labour wing Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and through expansion in schools. One of the most astounding examples of RSS helping create an ideological shift through its educational policies in a region, is its work done in BengalтАЩs famous Naxal cradle , the Naxalbari. Schools like Sarada Vidyamandir, in Naxalbari are examples of RSSтАЩs ideological expansion in places historically known for radical leftist movements . The schools by RSS spread across North Bengal take pride in teaching their students ancient hindu texts like The Ramayana and The Mahabharata in their traditional Hindu Upper Caste perspectives, instead of teaching the dalit and tribal children a history more relevant to their own communities. Another instance of RSSтАЩs ideological expansion is the mostly blatant appropriation of the non Brahminical tribal hindu culture into the Sangh & its very own traditional Hindutva narratives to gain confidence from these communities. One such instance of blatant cultural and religious appropriation of the non brahminical tribal Hinduism by the brahminicalhindutva masses is re-asserting тАЬParo HangтАЭ the hunter god of the tribal Rai Community an avatar of Lord Shiva. This renders the tribal Community as nothing but a part of the greater Uppercaste Hinduism like the one in the rest of country. There are several more instances of hindutva groups desperately trying to appropriate indigenous socio-cultural aspirations in desperate attempts to spread their roots in these areas of North Bengal. However in reality Hinduism , a Vedic religion unlike Christianity and Islam doesnтАЩt have any particular must be followed source like that of Bible or Quran. And has been interpreted differently by different communities spread across the Indian subcontinent over thousands of years and the present hindutva fanatics are trying to dilute these tribal and diversifiedcultures into their narratives of brahminical Hinduism. With an aim of creating a greater Hindu Rashtra , where there will be only one form of brahminical Hinduism. Alongside the growing presence in the plains of North Bengal, the BJP has also made significant impact on the political affairs of the hills. Recruiting its footsoldiers in the Darjeeling and adjoining districts with a more tacit alliance with a faction of the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) party; a party which has been in the forefront of the struggle to demand the separate statehood of тАЬGorkhalandтАЭ. The issue of a separate state of Gorkhaland has arguably been the single most dominant factor in the politics of Darjeeling and its surrounding foothills since the last four decades when the movement was started by Subhash Ghising. While the Trinamool Congress and earlier the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had totally rejected the idea of a separate state being carved out of the hills of Darjeeling and its surrounding areas, the BJP has found a way to gain the confidenceof the local people by radiating elusive hopes to mitigate the problems of the people of Gorkhaland. However in the past it has been made crystal clear by state BJP leadership that Gorkhaland and its statehood is never a BJP agenda . Hence, the BJP here has found itself in a Catch 22 situation where any support for the statehood for Gorkhaland will dilute its support base in the plains and rejection of the demand will alienate its supporting parties in the hills . Since the 2014 win of BJP in the Lok Sabha , the RSS has taken up stronger plans to create a more ideology based cadership in the hills, so that in future the BJP wouldnтАЩt have to rely much on the support of regional parties for holding up the very important Darjeeling Lok Sabha Seat, like they have done their groundwork in the plains of Cooch Behar and Alipurduar over the years. Historically the socio-political terrains of North Bengal has been shaped by ideological grounds whether dominated by the left or the far left factions alongside very impactful identity movements . But with shrinking of the left force and a centrist force like Trinamool congress coming in power, it has failed to cater to the ideological appetite of the local people. The ideological vacuum left by Tmcp has eventually been occupied by the Sangh, which infact has successfully appropriated the aspirations of the minority communities. The need of the hour is a combative ideological struggle and forces like Bhim Army which have been effective in a very similar situations in parts of Central India , it has shown how a social group can create a massive impact for the minority communities by working on the ground without directly involving in electoral machineries , which have time and again reduced these communities in mere clusters of vote banks with elusive hopes.

"402",3890,"https://www.forwardpress.in/2020/07/for-baburao-bagul-dalit-literature-was-about-defiance-in-the-face-of-suffering/","For Baburao Bagul, Dalit Literature was about defiance in the face of suffering","Baburao Bagul established a discourse in which Dalit Literature does not mean sorrowful accounts alone. It is rather a revolutionary form of assertion, a part of the movement aiming to annihilate caste; it is a celebration of dignity of the hitherto marginalized, writes Damni Kain While being the mirror of society, Baburao BagulтАЩs literary creations were rebel acts that aimed at dethroning the brahmanical forces. He broke new ground in Marathi literature by evolving a тАЬDalit consciousnessтАЭ. His characters not only question the inhumane caste-based hierarchy but destroy its very base. They are angry, they dissent, they revolt. They are subjected to unbearable sufferings, but they are not resigned to their situation. They fight ferociously to assert their self-respect and dignity. His stories do not consist of тАЬsavioursтАЭ; the downtrodden themselves are the heroes who rise in rage against the system that is the reason behind their degradation. Hence, Masthur, the protagonist in one of BagulтАЩs stories, says, тАЬWhen was I beaten by them? It was Manu who thrashed meтАЭ (Bagul, 2018).  Baburao Bagul started writing in 1952. His groundbreaking works include his first collection of short stories, Jevha Mi Jat Chorli Hoti (When I Hid My Caste), published in 1963. According to K. Satyanarayana and Susie Tharu (2013), this first book by Bagul was hailed as тАЬthe epic of DalitsтАЭ. The collection opened up new formal and thematic ground and gave Dalit literary thinking a huge momentum. He went on to publish Maran Swast Hot Ahe (Death is Getting Cheaper) in 1969 and Sud (Revenge) in 1970. Out of the grand collection of short stories that he wrote, тАЬRevoltтАЭ and тАЬWhen I Hid My CasteтАЭ brings out the protest against, to use AmbedkarтАЩs term, the тАЬdivision of labourersтАЭ. The conversation between Jai and his father in тАЬRevoltтАЭ tears apart this division: тАЬтАШWhere is it written that a BhangiтАЩs son must become a Bhangi?тАЩ, asks Jai. тАШIn our poverty. In our dharma. In our countryтАЩ, replies his father. Jai doesnтАЩt give in. He goes on to ask, тАШWhat dharma? If it breaks a person and turns him into an animal, is that Dharma? In this country that invests greater significance in a stone than in a human being? I will not heed such a dharma. If it has given us only this poverty, this deprivation, then it behoves us to reject itтАЩтАЭ (Bagul, 1999: 29-37). When Kashinath in тАЬWhen I Hid My CasteтАЭ asserts his defiance against the birth-based occupation given to him, he shouts in rage, тАЬI am a Mahar but that doesnтАЩt mean IтАЩm going to clean human shit and piss from the walls.тАЭ Both of them envisage a future in which they have gotten rid of their pain. They have a strong ambition to break away from the clutches of caste through education. AmbedkarтАЩs clarion call to тАЬEducate, Agitate, OrganizeтАЭ echoes when Jai argues with his father saying, тАЬJust for this I should become a Bhangi? Give up my education to clear up the dirt of the village? Carry filth on my head? If you wanted me to do that kind of work, why did you have me educated? Why did you let them light these lamps of independence, knowledge and humanity inside my mind?тАЭ Similarly KashinathтАЩs dream of liberation lies in becoming a lawyer. In a conversation with the protagonist of the story, he remarks, тАЬMasthur, IтАЩm going to quit this job. IтАЩm going to Mumbai. IтАЩll take what work I can get. IтАЩll finish my SSC. IтАЩll go to college. IтАЩll become a lawyer тАж This life, this terrible life.тАЭ These two stories are set in contrasting locales but have glaring similarities. тАЬRevoltтАЭ has a rural setting while тАЬWhen I Hid My CasteтАЭ unfolds in modern urban space. Caste travels with people like a shadow тАУ it is rigid enough with respect to oneтАЩs position in the hereditary social hierarchy but on the other hand it is fluid enough to cross borders as well. The glitters of city life are not тАЬcastelessтАЭ. In fact, the skyscrapers which stand proudly in the cities are symbols of caste-based segregation. In тАЬWhen I Hid My CasteтАЭ , the landlord Ramcharan, while renting his room to Masthur, says, тАЬWhen we meet a stranger, we always ask him his caste. This is the way in our country.тАЭ Another man adds, тАЬBrother, we can eat mud with a caste brother, but one shouldnтАЩt attend a feast with someone of lower caste.тАЭ Ramcharan, who initially admires Masthur for being a poet, unleashes violence upon knowing his caste. He beats him not for hiding the truth. Masthur invites his wrath for daring to break the brahmanical monopolization over knowledge. He is subjected to cruelty for writing and reading, something which the тАЬlower castesтАЭ were barred from doing for ages. This incident exposes the irony of a society which cries hoarse about so-called тАЬmeritтАЭ. MasthurтАЩs talent was discarded because of his caste. Baburao Bagul published his first collection of short stories, titled тАШJevha Mi Jat Chorli HotiтАЩ (When I Hid My Caste), in 1963. An English translation of the book was released in 2018 Dalit Literature is not simply a literary trend or formal development. It is a social movement taking on injustice and is driven by the hope of freedom. Baburao Bagul argued that тАЬthe established literature of India is Hindu literatureтАЭ and that the lowest castes are excluded from Indian literature because of its Hindu character. He elaborates: тАЬWriters who have internalized the Hindu value-structure find it impossible to accept heroes, themes and thoughts derived from the philosophies of Phule and AmbedkarтАЭ (Dangle, 1992). Bagul makes a radical change in this regard. The peripheries are his plot. The defiant heroes of the margins are well represented in тАЬGangsterтАЭ and тАЬStreetwalkerтАЭ. In an essay he wrote for the 1969 Diwali issue of Marathwada, Bagul asserts: тАЬDalit literature believes that looking for the meaning of life in social debates, philosophy or political manifestoes would make it monochromatic. The meaning of life is to be found in Nature. Man is the very embodiment of Nature. His desires, passions, emotions are the sun, moon, rain, shine, storms and gales of Nature. When these natural desires and emotions were crushed as the shad-ripu or the six perverse passions of human life, religion and gods became immortal and life, which once sang hymns to Usha, the Goddess of Dawn, was incarcerated in the dark. But now we herald the coming of tempests, wildfires and light; of varied paths and triumphant chariots. The ages will come and go like birds alighting on trees, and joys will abound.тАЭ Hence, Bagul sees Dalit Literature not as mere contestations in the discourse of politics and philosophy, because this one track, all-consuming approach would deprive an individual of his creativity and passion. For him, the meaning of literature is to be found in a personтАЩs emotions and desires. But when these were discarded as perverse, god and religion gained supremacy to dictate man. Bagul personifies tempests, wilderness and light, which is revolutionary, marking a discontinuity from the period when manтАЩs emotions were supposed to revolve around the dictates of religion. The Dalit Sahitya Sansad was established under the leadership of Baburao Bagul. Daya Pawar and Arjun Dangle held the position of general secretary of Dalit Sahitya Parishad (Pawar, 2019). Yogesh Maitreya (2018A) argues that Baburao Bagul, Sharad Patil and Sharankumar Limbale have helped construct a theory of Dalit Literature. BagulтАЩs 1981 work, Dalit Sahitya: Aajche Krantividnyan, is a ground-breaking work in this construction in which Dalit experience is reiterated as part of Dalit Literature. R. Kimbhaune (1999) explains why BagulтАЩs work stands out. He says it is because of his originality and achievement both in terms of subject matter and use of language. BagulтАЩs stories are packed with judiciously chosen realistic details from the lives of the downtrodden castes, the destitute, the depraved and criminals. The women characters in his stories depict a dignified celebration of Indian women. In her foreword to When I Hid My Caste, Shanta Gokhale (2018) notes, тАЬHe knocked readers off their feet by the sheer elemental force of his stories. But, more importantly, he liberated younger Dalit writers from the shackles of literary Marathi. They were now free to write in their own dialects. If readers, weaned on the preponderantly romantic literature of upper-caste Marathi writers, found these new voices difficult to stomach, so be it.тАЭ Baburao Bagul has left a legacy for poets who engage with brutal realities of IndiaтАЩs casteist society. His vision gives direction and hope to the present-day poets. Yogesh Maitreya (2018B) says, тАЬWhile the most striking aspect of Baburao BagulтАЩs stories is his ability to provide words for the pain that Dalits have to suffer in their everyday life, he does not stop there. His writings possess a charisma that makes a reader feel what most literary narratives lack in India тАУ he encourages us to develop a perspective that is humane amidst an inhumane society of caste(s).тАЭ Again, in her foreword to When I Hid My Caste, Gokhale (2018) notes that playwright Datta Bhagat asserts the political importance of BagulтАЩs work. According to Gokhale, Bhagat argues that Bagul established Dalit Literature as a movement which is the reflection of the social movement led by Jotirao Phule, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Gopal Ganesh Agarkar demanding freedom, justice and equality. Bagul did a considerable amount of public speaking. According to Eleanor Zelliot (1982), his comments evoked pungent emotions and the mood of Dalit Literature. She quotes Bagul: тАЬEven if Manu has been thrown into darkness, he has not died. He is living today in books, in holy scriptures, in temple after temple. He lives in mind after mind. The structure of the society that he created is what we have today. He is so great that societyтАЩs arrangements are under his control. And only his loving people are at the centre of power. So in India at this time there are two worlds, two powers, two life traditions and two scriptures. He who wants victory, he who wants influence must take a role in determining the future.тАЭ Bagul was a rebel and a visionary. His vision was based on his realization of the root cause of the degradation of Dalits. His attack on Manu as part of his protest against the caste system and untouchability distinguished him from other writers who, even while talking about miseries and human pain, never questioned the root cause. BagulтАЩs explanation of how Manu still rules this society is an important argument that needs to be reiterated to тАЬhis loving peopleтАЭ who are quick to dismiss puranas and dharmashastras and the casteism that they theorize and uphold as things of the past. Baburao Bagul established a discourse in which Dalit Literature does not mean sorrowful accounts alone. It is rather a revolutionary form of assertion, a part of the movement aiming to annihilate caste; it is a celebration of dignity of the hitherto marginalized.

"403",3891,"https://www.dalitcamera.com/dont-kill-varavara-rao-in-jail/","DON'T KILL VARAVARA RAO IN JAIL ├В┬╖ Dalit Camera","Press Note from Vara Vara RaoтАЩs Family|Hyderabad| July 12, 2020 We, the family members of Varavara Rao, world-renowned Telugu revolutionary poet and public intellectual, who is incarcerated in Navi MumbaiтАЩs Taloja Jail, are very much worried about his deteriorating health. His health condition has been scary for over six weeks now, ever since he was shifted in an unconscious state to JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail on May 28, 2020. Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health and he is still in need of emergency heathcare. The immediate cause of concern now is that we are very much perturbed at the routine phone call we received from him on Saturday evening. Though the earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi. As an eloquent and articulate public speaker and writer in Telugu for over five decades, a Telugu teacher for four decades and known for his meticulous memory, this fumbling, incoherence and loss of memory were in themselves strange and frightening. But the latest call, on July 11 is much more worrisome as he did not answer straight questions on his health and went into a kind of delirious and hallucinated talk about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively. Then his co-accused companion took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released. His co-prisoner also said he needs immediate medical care for not only physical but also neurological issues. The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage. This electrolyte imbalance may be fatal also. Taloja Jail Hospital is not at all equipped to handle this kind of serious ailment either in medical expertise or equipment. Thus it is highly required that he be shifted to a fully equipped super specialty hospital to save his life and prevent possible brain damage and risk to life due to electrolyte imbalance. At the present juncture we are leaving aside all the pertinent facts like, that the case against him is fabricated; he had to spend 22 months in jail as an undertrial with the process turned into punishment; his bail petitions got rejected at least five times now and even the bail petitions with his age, ill-health and Covid vulnerability as grounds were ignored. His life is the top most concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care. We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner.

On Thursday, 16 July, BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia spoke to the Dalit farmer couple who had allegedly consumed pesticide in front of their children in Madhya PradeshтАЩs Guna because the police tried to destroy their crops and evict their family from a piece of 'government-ownedтАЩ land. Scindia, on a telephone call arranged by MP minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia, assured the couple that they will get full justice and need not worry about anything. He further added, тАЬAs soon as I got to know about the incident, I spoke to the chief minister and got the SP, Collector transferred.тАЭ The woman also asked for help and support for her children in terms of land being allotted to them. Ramkumar Ahirwar has been practising cultivation on a piece of land in Guna, which is reportedly owned by the state government. The Guna administration had ordered the setting up of a Model College on that piece of land. According to local media reports, there were previous attempts made to vacate the land. But, the administration had been unsuccessful in laying the foundation stone so far. Nirmal Rathore, Tehsildar of Guna City, who was present at the spot on the day of the incident, 14 July, and under whose watch the eviction drive was being carried out had said: тАЬAfter taking measurement of the land, when the encroachment was being removed with JCB machines, the farmer couple tried to kill themselves by consuming poison.тАЭ Meanwhile, while narrating the events that transpired on 14 July, Ahirwar said, as per a report in The Indian Express: тАЬI was left with no choice. I begged them not to destroy the crop but they did not stop. They did it last year too and my debts have gone up. One more round of destruction, and I knew I would have nothing to feed my six children.тАЭ Videos that have since surfaced on social media showed policemen thrashing other locals present at the spot, including children. Regarding the videos, IG Gwalior Range Raja Babu Singh had told The Quint, тАЬThe video has been clipped and is being shared as police wielding lathis on locals but the police was actually trying to shoo away the people who were resisting the cops from taking the unconscious farmer couple to the hospital.тАЭ The Indian Express reported that the police had claimed that Shishupal, AhirwarтАЩs younger brother, had attacked them. However, Shishupal reportedly said, тАЬI did not assault anyone, I only pushed a constable because they were dragging my unconscious brother away. I told them not to do that and lift him properly. I got angry because they not only hit us with lathis but abused us and called us criminal Pardhis.тАЭ Meanwhile, the police have registered FIRs against Rajkumar, his wife Sabitri and other locals present at the spot. Among other charges, Section 353 of the IPC (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty, Section 309 of the IPC (Attempt to suicide) have been added to the FIR.

A Dalit man died in police custody on Tuesday late night in Prakasam district after he was detained by the police allegedly for not wearing a face mask while riding on a motorcycle. The deceased Yericharla Kiran was undergoing treatment for a head injury in Guntur. However, he succumbed to his injuries. On July 18, Kiran was detained by the police for not wearing a mask and helmet in a COVID-19 hotspot of Chirala town in Prakasam district. According to police, Kiran and his friend Shini Abraham were moving on a motorcycle without masks and a constable Rami Reddy at Kothapeta check-post reprimanded them. Police allegedly found that the duo were in an inebriated condition. Police in a press note said that the duo created a ruckus and allegedly beat up the constable following which Sub-Inspector (SI) Vijay Kumar took them into custody. Police claim that Kiran jumped out of the moving police vehicle while being taken to the II Town police station, resulting in a head injury. The family members of the deceased allege that the police hit him on his head causing the fatal injury. Police said that Kiran was first shifted to the Chirala Government hospital and later to a private hospital in Guntur for better treatment. The incident has caused a furore in the state over repeated police violence against Dalits in the past two days. TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh, slamming the YSRCP government said, ├в┬А┬ЬDon├в┬А┬Щt Dalits have a right to live under Jagan├в┬А┬Щs regime?├в┬А┬Э Pointing out the cases of Varaprasad and Kiran, he said, ├в┬А┬ЬTo gain the appreciation of the ruling party leaders, police had tortured Varaprasad and now a Dalit youth Kiran Kumar in Prakasam district died due to police assault. Is there law and order in this state? The police who ought to protect the citizens have turned into lackeys of the ruling party and are attacking the Dalits like goondas.├в┬А┬Э Varaprasad, a Dalit man was tonsured and humiliated by the SI in Seethanagaram police in East Godavari district, allegedly at the behest of the local YSRCP leaders, over a feud involving a sand lorry. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, tension prevailed in Thomaspeta area of Chirala following Kiran├в┬А┬Щs death. Police deployed additional forces to prevent any untoward incident. Probe Initiated Kiran├в┬А┬Щs father Mohan filed a complaint against SI Vijay Kumar following which he was booked under IPC Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means). Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy initiated an inquiry into the incident and announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh to the victim├в┬А┬Щs family.

An inquiry was ordered into the incident after police officials were seen using force on the deceased couple. A probe was ordered into the case by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. According to a recent development, Chouhan also ordered the removal of Guna collector S Vishwanathan as well as Tarun Nayak, the SP of Guna district on Wednesday. The incident took place on Tuesday when an eviction drive was being carried on government land. The deceased man was identified as Rajkumar Ahirwar. Initially, the government had tweeted that the couple consumed poison after they were ""instigated by some people"". The 45-bigha government land in Jaganpur Chak was allotted to construct a college but the same land was encroached upon by Gappu Pardhi, a 'land mafia'. Gappu had allegedly rented the land to Rajkumar for farming. When the revenue officials went to the area for the encroachment, Rajkumar and his family raised an objection. In the video that went viral, the police could be seen thrashing the couple with lathis. Rajkumar and his wife were being kicked by a policewoman. A senior official quoted the CM and said, ""My government will take strong action against mafia and criminals but force is not to be used against common people. "" The incident came to light when a video of the cops using force on the family went viral on social media, The Times of India reported. In the video, the couple's children could be seen crying as they sat near the bodies of their parents. Home minister Narottam Mishra said that they have taken cognizance of the case.

A photograph of the children of Rajkumar Ahirwar and wife Savitri, who are stable, crying next to their unconscious mother on Tuesday, and a video showing police beating up AhirwarтАЩs younger brother had gone viral. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced the action against the Collector and SP late on Wednesday night. Officials had arrived with a bulldozer at the 45-bigha Guna land reserved for a government post-graduate college, a major chunk of which has allegedly been encroached upon by Ahirwar. An attempt to clear it in November last year had been blocked by the family of Gappu Pardhi, who claims to own the land. Ahirwar told the officials that he had taken the land on lease and raised loan to cultivate it, and the family would have no option but to end their lives if their crop was destroyed. After the couple consumed pesticide, the police had booked them as well as others for trying to obstruct public officials on duty. Before he was removed, Collector Vishwanathan told The Indian Express that the police had to use force as AhirwarтАЩs relatives were not letting them take the couple to hospital. He also said the government had sanctioned Rs 12 crore for construction of the college, and any further delay could have resulted in it being shifted to another district. The Collector said the Ahirwars might have been instigated by someone to take the step, to stop the team from clearing the encroachment.

The Range Officer went there with a full platoon, at least three SUVs and half a dozen armed guards in combat fatigue with the preparedness of dealing with any dreaded forest mafia. They got down from the vehicles, rushed to Swapna Barman and triumphantly pointed guns at her as if they had just caught hold of a prized timber Don. During heavy monsoon, the river Teesta overflows and that is also the time when tree logs come floating which some of the local enthusiasts try to pull ashore. These logs are then sold at a much cheaper price in the local markets. This has been a phenomenon every monsoon. In fact, the floating logs have become so predictable that it has become a sort of monsoon festival to collect logs from the Teesta. As the water recedes, it even becomes easier to drag the logs from the dry river banks. The forest department, on the other hand, is not known to have chased the logs though most of the logs are well sectioned tree stems apparently get drifted from the piles of felled logs from inside the forests. One reason of this inertia on the part of the department being that too much of monitoring on the drifted logs might well open up a cupboard for more skeletons to tumble down as most of these logs are unaccounted timbers ostensibly felled as part of the irregular chopping of forest trees. But this time for the lone pair of such logs there was extraordinary eagerness and hyperactive drives on the part of the forest department. Therefore, this time they had raided the house of Swapna Barman, a daughter of a rickshaw puller, a native Rajbanshi Schedule Caste girl, whose family, till the other day, just could manage two square meals a day. But the situation slightly changed when Swapna Barman became the only Indian so far to have won the gold medal in the 2018 Asian Games in the event called heptathlon, an athletic event which, like many of them, most of her own villagers never heard of till she won the medal. Earlier, she had also won a gold medal in the Asian Athletic Championship in 2017 and got a silver medal in the SAF Games in 2016. Being the champion of one of the toughest athletic events she soon became well-known all over the country. For her extraordinary sporting achievements, she was also conferred with the coveted Arjuna Award. In the same Asiad Games, Assamese girl, Hima Das too won the gold medal in the 400 metres mixed and womenтАЩs relay. Young Hima Das deservedly became a celebrity in Assam. She has also been offered the job of DSP by the state government. In stark contrast to such glorious journey, Swapna Barman received a lukewarm welcome in Kolkata airport, the capital of her home state, moderate cash rewards from the state, and that is about it, where it all ended. Swapna belongs to the Koch Rajbanshi community, an indigenous repressed community recognized as Scheduled Caste in the state of West Bengal. But in the caste sensitive Bengal society, they have always been considered as pariahs, the low castes; the mainstream castes of Bengal even twisted a term to describe them as the Bah├йs, a Rajbanshi colloquial term of respect turned into a derogatory word by the mainstream Bengal to stigmatize the entire community. In a well-known Bengali novel (TeestaParerBrittanta) the community is symbolically represented by a loin clad semi civilized character, Bagharu. The popular novel has forever immortalized the image of naked Bagharu as the quintessential identity of a Rajbanshi in Bengal. Swapna Barman belongs to this community who are, for the mainstream Bengal, a ridiculous Bah├й, a Bagharu, a semi civilized, quasi savage entity. Swapna Barman, as was revealed later, was constantly cajoled for about three days by an incumbent to buy a pair of floating logs from him. The desperate seller finally could dump two timber logs in the front yard of her thatched house. Like most of the people in the village, she finally agreed to purchase the log. But before even a lone plank of the wood could be used, the very next morning the forest department, on a тАШtip-offтАЩ appeared in lightning speed and she was caught тАШred-handedтАЩ dealing with illegal timber. This apparently highly тАШlaudableтАЩ forest activism generated a variety of responses. Predictably, the mainstream Bengal media turned the forest officers as the ultimate protagonists, the champions of forest protection. The arrival of the forest team was well organised and well equipped. Right on their landing, about half a dozen guards aimed their guns at Swapna and another half a dozen opened their mobiles and cameras to shoot videos of Swapna being тАШcaughtтАЩ, a scoop for the media that the forest officials brought to cover the event. Swapna was seen pleading the lady beat officer not to take videos of her because that would ruin her career which, she said, тАШI had painstakingly built for the last nine years. I toiled with my sweat and blood to reach here. Please donтАЩt destroy me.тАЩ Then came running her brother to stand in front and said it was he and not his sister who had got those logs. The half a dozen gunmen then turned their guns to the young boy, put him in a corner and forced him to squat on the ground, the boy then ended up looking helplessly at the barrels pointed at him. When Swapna ran to her brother to protect him from assault, then Panchali Ray, the тАШupright and highly activeтАЩ Beat officer dragged out Swapna to face the guns again. When Swapna was still pleading to listen to her, and let her explain, the тАШuprightтАЩ beat officer asked that famous question, тАШTumi Key?тАЩ (Who are you?) Surely before she came to the house of Swapna Barman, the most famous address of Gomostopara, she did not come as an ignorant as to where they were heading to for the catch. She could not be as dumb. In fact, she did not ask the question to get an answer; rather she had asked the question to give an answer. With that question she had instantly turned Swapna into a persona non-grata; with that question, the Beat officer had actually shown the wretched daughter of a rickshaw puller, a Rajbanshi bahe, a low caste pariah, as one with despicable social credibility, what she actually was. Swapna was reminded by that question that she was an expendable non-entity, no matter what might have been her achievements for the country. The Range Officer showed his officious authority by issuing her challans to show the papers of those logs within 30 days sharp and heroically zoomed off after giving precious bytes to the media which they had brought along to the spot. However, when they had departed with the satisfaction of having effectively ruined Swapna as the videos got uploaded within seconds to circulate SwapnaтАЩs ignominious fall, the same video also reached others- her community members, for whom Swapna was one of the very few reasons to be proud of. The incident turned to be a catalyst for one of the biggest mobilisations of the Koch Rajbanshi Kamatapuri community for a social cause in North Bengal. The incident even created a furore in Assam. The news story that followed in the mainstream media of Bengal screamed with the headline, Illegal Timber found at SwapnaтАЩs House. Curiously a moral brigade appeared who got тАШdevastatedтАЩ at such reprehensible criminal act of Swapna Barman. Some even demanded setting up of a bigger commission to investigate SwapnaтАЩs connections with the illegal timber traders. In short, they demanded enquiries into the links of Swapna in plundering the forest of Bengal. The District President of the Sports Association, Mihir Bandopadhyay was quick to project Swapna as a criminal, тАШNo matter how big a player she is, there must be exemplary actions against herтАЩ. One Purajit Bakshi Gupta of the District Sports Association seemed to have got equally devasted at SwapnaтАЩs crime, тАШAs a sportsman, I am aghast and ashamed.тАЩ(in UttarbangaSambad, 14 July 2020) The same newspaper wrote with enthusiasm, тАШSwapna broke down in front of the officers and finally gave in to admit her crime.тАЩ To the local Koch Rajbanshis the incident had given them a sense of d├йj├а vu, for this has been too familiar a pattern through which the Rajbanshis have been routinely criminalized by the mainstream narrative of Bengal. The virtual spaces on the mobiles crowded with uproar as the Koch Rajbanshi youths set the social media platforms ablaze. The video of humiliated Swapna got viral. The political parties, TMC and BJP found themselves in a Catch 22 imbroglio, the 45% voter share of the Rajbanshis in North Bengal is too pricey to be given away on a platter to the opponents. The forthright and straight-to-your- face community leader, the firebrand Bongshi Badan Barman, the Chairman of Rajbanshi Unnayan Parishad, called up the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, and warned that the situation would go out of control if those officers were not taken to task for having plotted against the biggest Rajabanshi sporting icon and the CM must ensure removal of all the false charges against her. Almost soon after, Mamata Banerjee came on camera to castigate the two forest officials, ordered their transfers and declared Swapna as innocent. But curiously, her own Forest Minister had earlier showered praise on the two forest officers for having nabbed one involved in illegal timber trading. However, after her announcement, Babul Supriyo, Union Minister of State for Environment and Forest, was enraged at the CM for having encouraged the тАШplunderer of the precious forestтАЩ and for having discredited two of the most тАШpious forest officers of the countryтАЩ- Sanjay Dutta and Panchali Ray. When Babul SupriyoтАЩs video statement had gone viral, the BJP sensed trouble at the growing anger of the Rajbanshis against the party, so soon Babul Supriyo amended his statements. It turned into a macabre political comedy of sort. This incident, however, is not an isolated one, it is part of a pattern through which the Rajbanshis in Bengal have been criminalized, racially discriminated against and socially castigated. This incident was preceded by another event where a gang of extortionists had locked up a house in Coochbehar and driven out the owner of the house who was a Rajbanshi school teacher. The extortionists had demanded Rs. 10,00, 000/- (rupees ten lakhs) as a тАШdonationтАЩ to be paid by the teacher in order to get back his own house. All the three extortionists happened to be Hindu Bengalis who had to be arrested following extraordinary public protests and pressure. There are reasons to believe that SwapnaтАЩs incident might as well be a calculated act to remind the Rajbanshis that the land, the erstwhile Kamrup Kamata, in which they have been living for centuries, no longer belonged to them. The transfer orders of the two high caste Bengali officials immediately followed by a volley of racist and despicable misogynist slurs in the social media against the community and Swapna Barman. The racist and misogynist slurs were so vile and abusive that several Koch Rajbanshi women organisations from Jalpaiguri had to approach the cyber cells to formally lodge complaints. The Swapna Barman episode was followed by another tragic incident in North Dinajpur, where, on 19 July, a 16 years old Rajbanshi school student was allegedly raped and brutally murdered. As the protest erupted the Bengal media reported the incident as the protest of irate people at the тАШdeath of a girlтАЩ. This time the suspected perpetrator appeared to be a Muslim following the recovery of his mobile and his bicycle at the spot. Officially the incident was quickly termed as suicide. Since the perpetrator appeared to be a Muslim, the BJP got overactive and turned into the biggest supporter of the Rajbanshis. The body of the rape and murder suspect was found a couple of days later. This time the TMC government turned too swift to arrest the father, the uncle and younger brother of the 16 years old rape and murder victim. Earlier, on 12 July, the Rajbanshi MLA from Hemtabad constituency in North Dinajpur, Debendranath Ray, was found hanging in the verandah of a shop in the market. Nobody believes the official version that he went to the market and committed suicide. This is symptomatic of Kafkaesque existential experience of the Koch Rajbanshis in Bengal who have been brutally subjected to repressions and been reduced not just into peripheral disjuncts but into effective non-entities. The author teaches at North-Eastern Hill University, (NEHU) Shillong. ItтАЩs a powerful story. In the world of prejudices against Dalits and the tribal, how easy it becomes to malign the rarest of the jewels that the community may produce once in their life time. This is not how the affluent criminals are dealt with.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

"414",3941,"https://www.recordnepal.com/police-charge-at-dalit-protestors-in-janakpur","Police charge at Dalit protestors in Janakpur - The Record","News 2 MIN READ Abha Lal, July 5, 2020, Kathmandu Share this article The stateтАЩs heavy-handed response to Dalit demands  The Dalit Struggle Committee of Dhanusa organized a protest on Thursday, July 2, in Janakpur to demand justice for Shambhu Sada and Raju Sada, two young Musahar men who died in police custody and a government quarantine facility, respectively, in the last month. Police fired tear gas and warning shots into the air, and charged the protestors with batons, seriously injuring Bijap Kumari Sada, Kalyan Kumar Sada, and Ramchandra Mahara--who are seeking treatment in hospitals in Janakpur and Dharan--and injuring at least a dozen others. One police officer is also reported to have been injured. Protests had been going on in Janakpur since mid-June, when Shambhu Sada, a 23-year-old truck driver from Sabaila Municipality was found hanging in the bathroom in police custody. Many, including SadaтАЩs mother, believe that the police murdered Sada, while others think that the police drove him to suicide, through physical and emotional torture. Anger grew when a couple of weeks later, 16-year-old Raju Sada died for want of treatment for diarrhea while waiting for his COVID-19 test report in a government quarantine facility--he later tested negative for the virus. While government probes were launched to investigate both incidents, protestors say that necessary action was not taken in response to either of the events. According to Pacchu Majhi, a member of the Dalit Struggle Committee, the protestorsтАЩ immediate demands include compensation for both of the deceased mensтАЩ families, and the suspension of police officers and medical supervisors held responsible for the deaths. According to journalist BP Sah, between 4,000 and 5,000 people, mostly from Dalit communities around Janakpur, had come to the town in tractors and gathered in Barabigha field for the protests. The protestors made their way from Ramananda Chowk to Piradi Road through to Madhes Bhawan, where Pacchu Majhi said that there was an altercation. тАЬWe had told the protestors to keep everything peaceful and not cause any trouble. The plan was to hold a minute of silence for Shambhu and Raju. One person threw a rock at the gate of the Chief MinisterтАЩs office, and thatтАЩs when the police became violent,тАЭ Majhi said. тАЬWe controlled the crowd and told the police officers that the remaining proceedings would be completely peaceful, but they started beating old people with sticks and firing shots in the air.тАЭ BP Sah told The Record that the police mostly beat the people who were at the tail end of the protesting crowd, who were mostly elderly people and women. Sah was detained for a couple of hours for allegedly тАЬinstigatingтАЭ the protests. Janakpur SP Ramesh Basnet refused to answer questions about why a journalist was detained, but said that the protestors had created chaos and that force was necessary. тАЬThere was stone-pelting outside the Madhesh Bhawan and a vehicleтАЩs window was also broken. ThatтАЩs why we began the lathi-charge,тАЭ Basnet said. Both Sah and Majhi believe that the police escalated the violence even after the stone pelting stopped. тАЬShambhuтАЩs mother made a narrow escape. She was directly in the line of fire outside Madhes Bhawan. The police were threatening people, telling them that they would go to their villages and shoot them,тАЭ Majhi said. Journalist Bhola Paswan, who has been following issues pertaining to Dalits closely for many years, told The Record that Dalit Struggle Committees across the country have been holding meetings about how to take the movement forward. тАЬThe anger from one incident has barely died down when another gruesome event happens. I think the protests are likely to continue to grow. I have been witnessing a lot of organizing happening,тАЭ Paswan said. :::::::: Abha Lal Abha Lal is a former Associate Editor and current contributor to The Record.

You can update your channel preference from the Settings menu in the header menu.  In yet another outrageous incident, a 7-year-old Dalit girl who went missing on June 30 was found dead yesterday evening in a forest area near her village with severe injuries on her face. She was allegedly raped by her neighbour before the murder. The incident has been reported from the Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu, where the girl had gone out to play at 4 pm on June 30. Her father filed a complaint with the police after they looked for her all over the area when she did not return home by 7 pm. The girl's body was found in a forest yesterday evening with grievous injuries on her face. It was found that she was raped before the murder, but the exact cause of death will be determined when the post-mortem report is out. An investigating official reportedly told TNM, ""The girl was playing outside her home at 4pm. Her parents then found her missing and her father filed a complaint at the station at around 7pm. Efforts were then underway to find the girl. She has been beaten with sticks on the face and injuries are clearly visible. The post-mortem will reveal the actual cause of death."" The accused, a 25-year-old neighbour of the girl, apparently took advantage of the fact that the girl was all alone out on the streets. ""During inquiry he admitted that he had sexually assaulted and murdered the girl, Further investigation is underway and we will have more clarity once we get the post mortem report,"" a police official said, according to TNM's report.

Mayawati said that the Modi government should leave its casteist mentality aside and provide monetary assistance to the affected family. The incident took place in the Raibha village of Achhnera block in Agra where a woman's cremation was stopped by upper caste men on July 20, but the police did not take any action even after eight days of the incident. The woman had to be cremated outside the crematorium because of the protest by upper caste residents of the village. The local police did not take action against the culprits and kept trying to force a compromise. The police also made them perform the cremation outside the crematorium. After videos of this incident went viral, the SSP Bablu Kumar has taken cognizance of the incident, setting up a team led by the circle office Achhnera and asked to submit a report. 25 people have been booked under Section 151 of the CrPC. CO Achhnera VS Beer Kumar said the police had immediately reached the spot upon receiving the information but the affected family did not want any action to be taken against the culprits. Bhagwan Singh of Raibha said there are about 24 families of Dalits in Raibha and they want action to be taken against the culprits, they will not say anything. Congress city president Devendra Kumar Chillu told India Today that it is a shameful incident and there should be a high-level inquiry into the incident.He said the Modi government and its supporters are trying to suppress the Dalits and backward classes, but they will not succeed in this motive as the Congress will unite the Dalits, Muslims, and backwards against UP's Yogi government and Centre's Modi government, throwing them off. He demanded that the inquiry should be done by a retired judge. Minority leader and Bhartiya Muslim Vikas Parishad Chairman Sami Aghai said that the current government's slogan 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' is the biggest farce as this government thinks of the 'Vikas' of the upper caste Hindus only, sowing seeds of hatred against the Muslims, Dalits and backwards in their minds. He added that the Achhnera incident is very shameful and strict action should be taken against the guilty. He said that a dead body has no caste and crematoriums and graveyards should not be allowed to be segregated according to castes.

"419",3979,"https://www.dalitcamera.com/delhi-failure-rehabilitation-manual-scavengers/","Delhi's shame: The complete failure of rehabilitation of the manual scavengers ├В┬╖ Dalit Camera","In Shahdara, Seema has opened a small parlor in the Valmiki Basti. She says, тАЬI have seen the men of my neighbourhood die doing this. They have slowly vanished in the sewer one after the other. One goes and the other follows. She says I saw Ravi die in front of me.тАЭ Written by Pragya Akhilesh|Delhi|July 23, 2020 Firstly, we have to make sure that we organise our data and repeatedly follow up with people after the process of both rescue and rehabilitation. Individuals need to collect their very own data as the one provided by the government, the National Commission for Safai Karmacharis (NCSK) and the NGOs can be obsolete and incomplete. The informal settlements of Delhi which are not completely authorised rarely have sewer lines and establishment of a person engaged in this work is as difficult as gathering the information of an unauthorised area having a septic tank. It is also important to understand that it is difficult to collect substantial data of the people engaged in this work because no one wants to agree and say that they are forcing someone or that someone is willfully entering the septic tanks. The data, collected and then provided by the institutions for research work on rehabilitation also consists of many inconsistencies. In many cases, as the person has often migrated into the city from other states, the lack of contact information is persistent in nearly all sets of data. In particular cases, the name of the deceased is also wrong because the deceased was known with a secondary name. The Safai Karmachari Andolan of Bezwada Wilson has a far better grasp of this data which NGOs and institutions can request from the network in the case of rehabilitation of manual scavengers. Each year the government identifies more people as manual scavengers but fails to provide a viable rehabilitation model to the manual scavengers and the families of the deceased people because of these septic tanks. Together with a strict ban we also need integrated ways of rehabilitation for these people, not just singular promises of livelihood or distribution of loan pamphlets. Individuals, Institutions and both the central and state government have to change their approach when it comes to rebuilding the lives of the manual scavengers in India.тАЛтАЛ These are the real stories of people whose lives are forcefully tied to the work of manual scavenging directly and indirectly. These people face the reality of this trap every single day. They are in desperate need of different ways of rehabilitation. We have failed to emphasise the complete integration of various structures within and outside an individual. In this column, we have tried to sociologically understand the failure of rehabilitation and restoration from a few cases over the last 5 years through the Rehabilitation Research InitiativeтАЩs Archive: Delhi Chapter. In Pooth Kalan, near Rohini, AshokтАЩs body is being handed over to his family. His family members are shocked and confused. They say we donтАЩt have faith in God anymore. We donтАЩt know how we will eat now. In Ghitorni, DeepakтАЩs family is struggling to make ends meet. Both Deepak and his friend Balwinder died cleaning the septic tanks two years ago. His neighbour Mohan says, тАЬI have seen them going every day to Babus for compensation. I told them, you never get compensation, they make you feel that you died because you were a rat, you belonged in the tank. This is our work. You know, another man died the same day. I think his name was Svarn or something. You come to Delhi without family, here you are not scared. There is so much pressure to send money back. You do anything to survive.тАЭ Mohan is right, nearly half of the people who have lost their family members cleaning the sewers do not get compensation. If the compensation comes, it is never the full amount, that too, after running after people and Babus for days at a stretch. Mohan says while compensation is one problem, the other half of it is peopleтАЩs treatment towards us. He also says that people behave as if they are throwing the money at us. In the case of receiving compensation, the compensation only lasts for 6 months or a year. Here, other means of livelihood and rehabilitation become the main issues. In most cases, the person who has died was the only earning member of the family. In Shahdara, Seema has opened a small parlor in the Valmiki Basti. She says, тАЬI have seen the men of my neighbourhood die doing this. They have slowly vanished in the sewer one after the other. One goes and the other follows. She says I saw Ravi die in front of me.тАЭ After a long pause, she sings a song slowly. She is mourning within the scope of her song. She continues, тАЬI donтАЩt like waxing. I hate giving foot massages to women and I donтАЩt know how to cut. I will probably hire a girl for that but then how will I give the rent of the parlour, I donтАЩt know. I think if some of us women from Jhilmil did this together, I would have had more time to spend with my son.тАЭ In the case of SeemaтАЩs Parlour, an NGO approached Seema. It seems that before reaching her, they would have come to Shahdara to cover the death of Ravi who died of asphyxiation in the sewer, a few weeks ago. After 6 months Seema is seen struggling with this business as she needs to hire more employees specialised in services that are expected to be there in a Parlour like this. The cost of employing a person in this area can go up to 5000 rupees but in this case, her profitability is nearly 8000 per month. Every month Seema has to set aside 3000 rupees to pay the rent. The cost of keeping an employee is simply too high. This is making the business suffer as it is not able to provide all the required services. Here, when Seema opened her Parlour they only thought about the singular goal of opening a viable option of employability but did not take into account the problems that may arrive after rehabilitation. A linear method of rehabilitation does not assess the integrated connection between ever-changing goals post-rehabilitation of a case. Seema says when she narrated her problems, she was given a piece of National Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC) pamphlet. She found the schemes to be very complicated and could not follow it at all. She wanted someone to explain it to her so she kept calling this NGO for 4 months, but nobody replied. Ekta heads a Self Help Group of 50 women in Sonia Vihar. This Self Help Group comprises women whose families have been doing the work of scavenging for many years. Some of the women have been doing this work for more than two decades. Ekta says, тАЬnobody cares for us, we are left to fend for ourselves. So many people come to the Valmiki Basti for years promising us jobs. It hardly happens. I have four daughters to feed. Now I am learning to sew but I donтАЩt know where to sell them. NGOs do not understand that I cannot leave my daughters at home and go to work every day in remote areas of Delhi. I also cannot go from North Delhi to West Delhi every day as whatever I will earn will go on travel fare. These things restrict my choices.тАЭ In the case of Ekta, individuals have helped her in opening a Self Help Group. She hosts routinely meetings with the other women and till now has been able to gather more than 50 women to her Group. This approach of opening a Self Help Group is a very good socio-economic model for a woman in her position. The establishment of the Self-Help Groups (SHGs) has helped the rural communities in the absence of any other alternative credit facility, this, particularly in the last two decades, has mobilized more than 5.7 crore women in this country. The interaction with the rural communities facilitated by this model has helped in building non-farm livelihood opportunities leading to an unparalleled change in the rural-urban dynamic within Delhi. If SeemaтАЩs Parlour was opened in partnership with someone with similar interests, it would have probably been the solution to her problems. In SeemaтАЩs Parlour, the availability of other women would also have supported her in being able to spend more time with her son. Here, she and this group of women were also provided with a skill training session of sewing but these women did not know what to do after sewing these products. They lack the marketing skills which are required to sell these products. If these women do not sell these products they will begin to lose interest in this way of rehabilitation. This will also harm the health of the Self Help Group as more and more women will become disintegrated from this Group. This is why holding the hands of these women in the initial days of finding new ways of outlets to sell the products is very important. It is also important to teach these women these minimum tools of self-sustenance. Sanjay is a tailor in the Valmiki Basti in Farukh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. He has trained Ekta and this Self Help Group in Sonia Vihar in operating sewing machines. He has taught them to make Salwars, Kurtas and Bags. Sanjay says, тАЬI can teach sewing to anyone in a monthтАЩs training yet when it comes to employing me they donтАЩt seem to care. I donтАЩt know why local boutiques donтАЩt keep me, something is always incomplete in my resume. This is what they say.тАЭ These are all examples of negligent ways of rehabilitating an individual. Within this, the emphasis on the structural integration of various systems is not valued. This is a тАШsingular/linearтАЩ rehabilitation approach. Institutions and individuals often plan to rehabilitate people with set goals. It has to be kept in mind that certain goals are only transitional goals, these goals are a part of a complex network of goals in a holistic rehabilitation. The mere objective method of rehabilitation for the achievement of a singular goal like opening up a business, enrolling a group of students in vocational training does not take into account the history, socio-economic and cultural background of a group or community. This application of knowledge breaks the linear method of rehabilitation and is called subjective rehabilitation. The third is the evaluative method which takes into account the physical and psycho-social health of an individual before opening up a business or an enrollment. It understands the limitations caused by the physical and mental health of a person and uses this knowledge to create an integrated way of rehabilitation. In the case of Sanjay, individuals who were trying to rehabilitate him by searching for a job based on his skills also have to apply their subjective knowledge of his socio-economic background during his rehabilitation. The lack of his employability can also be a case of caste discrimination. The integrated methodology of rehabilitation takes into account both the direct and indirect methods of rehabilitation. It focuses on the objective, subjective and evaluative systematic networked approach of rehabilitation. It acts as a sum total of micro-macro approaches that not only integrate symbolic interactions with social systems but also establish relationships between different network levels. In a specific case where a member has lost his individual and collective agency, it is important to understand that rehabilitation should be conceptualized in relational terms that are not just manufactured to produce the output of the study. Here, setting an interview in another individualтАЩs presence may help the discriminating employer to look at his combined skills. Asking persistent questions to this employer as to why SanjayтАЩs resume is not fit can put the employer on the spot so that he cannot get away with this behaviour. Meenakshi who is the resident of the same Basti in Farukh Nagar, says, тАЬfrom the last 5 years I have gone to numerous Skill Training programs sponsored by both the government and the NGOs. They teach us tally and Java. I donтАЩt follow it at all.тАЭ With Meenakshi, we have to expand into understanding why she is not able to follow the programs. Talking to her using different ethnomethodological techniques might help in understanding the outlying psycho-social problems that she may be going through. It can be the case that perhaps she is not able to share her problems with her family members. Here, sending her to these programs with a group of people who might not have the same socio-economic background, but people she relates to, like her friends from school might help her concentrate and enjoy these training sessions. Another aspect of it is that Meenakshi may be interested in other things than learning Tally or Java. The set syllabus of the vocational training has to be reset as per the individuals who are going to spend the time in these training sessions. MeenakshiтАЩs friend, Aarti lives in Loni, Banthla. She is an NGO Community Resource Person of this area. She says, тАЬI like to sing and act and then put it up on apps like Tik Tok and Likee. I want to be like Sapna Chaudhary. I donтАЩt know why they only want to teach sewing to us. I donтАЩt like sewing because I am not good at it.тАЭ She smiles and continues тАЬyou know women can do more than just cooking and sewing, they can become a star too.тАЭ AartiтАЩs brother Sourabh says, тАЬDidi my life is set, I am not in clouds like Aarti, I want to keep three buffaloes, open a small dairy business and from the profit of that one day I will go to Bombay and act in big films like Salman Khan.тАЭ AartiтАЩs sayings are quite accurate. She wants to break away from the confinements of gender roles. She is challenging individuals who only know the brick and mortar ways of rehabilitation to expand their understanding of digital media. Individuals need to learn ways of monetisation in digital media to help Aarti rehabilitate with her central skills. Sudha who lives in Tilla Village says, тАЬI lost my brother to Tuberculosis last year. He used to cough for many hours at a stretch. I have lost a child to TB too. I used to go there, clean the toilets of Bade Saab. They all told me not to go there anymore, but you tell me, what should I do? Now I collect waste from the houses and dump it in a nearby place. Didi, you think it is easy to pick up waste from these dust bins, you find dead pigeons, rats, meat carcasses in it. It is not different from the work I used to do.тАЭ Geeta Devi, SudhaтАЩs mother says, тАЬI go every day to clean toilets in a Bade SaabтАЩs house. She says the activists talk about rehabilitation from the work we do but still put us to do the same things. I am still cleaning the toilets. Yes, I am earning more now but I donтАЩt like this work. Why canтАЩt they employ us in one of the factories? The Yadavs in my colony still call me Kude waali/latrine safai karne waali.тАЭ Women from Geeta DeviтАЩs neighbourhood also spoke about the hasty generalization about putting all the castes under the same banner. They say some of the Yadavs in our colony also go inside septic tanks. Individuals who come to talk to us seem to lack the understanding of caste dynamics. Another woman says, тАЬThey think all of us have to be only Dalits. Yes, I am a Dalit woman but I am a Deha Dalit, a few migrated Shahanis also live in our Basti. People donтАЩt want to hear our stories, they just want to give us a speech on dignity.тАЭ Sudha and Geeta DeviтАЩs position is also a classic case of linear rehabilitation. They both need acute physical and psycho-social care. They have to be told that they can successfully do many things. Both of these women are being put up in a position where they are doing the same thing in a wealthier neighbourhood. This is taking a toll on their physical and mental health. Here, we see that people are often put in the same environment of cleaning toilets in colony homes. The displacement of an individual from one place to the other in similar roles do not solve the problems of dignity or sustenance. Individuals often get trapped in the cycle of self-doubt and lack of self-esteem because of repeated employment in similar areas. In other cases, too, opening a Sanitary Mart also poses problems of repeated employment in similar areas. Sudha says that the government keeps banning the supply of plastic bags so she has to use a Katta. The problem with it is that she has to use the same Katta to collect waste for months sometime. The non-availability of an alternative to a plastic bag makes the situation even worse. The government does not understand that merely counting the number of toilets and establishing it as a measure of success does not make IndiaтАЩs sanitation crisis any better. For every toilet that is constructed, there is also a case of a person being employed in the maintenance of these toilets. It is often the case that institutions lure the people engaged in cleaning septic tanks in their area in the pursuit of having to pay them less. Geeta Devi also says that the lack of water supply, disinfectants, toilet cleaners and preventive gears make the work as challenging as working in the dry latrine pits. Moreover, the availability of migrant labour, in this case, subsidises the workfare as now, Geeta Devi cannot demand a higher wage because more and more people are available to do the same job. Another thing is that individuals often do not understand the dynamics of different castes in India. A deep understanding of castes and intersectionality of caste with religion and gender is required before approaching people and trying to rehabilitate them. Individuals often hurt the sentiments of the very people they want to help. This is also a part of the subjective methodology of integrated rehabilitation. It is also true that we, as a society should be collectively ashamed about our lack of knowledge of the historical, socio-economic and cultural differences of communities. Individuals need to first read about the community they want to approach. In a few cases, individuals tell us that they are also often shamed more by other individuals in various institutions than the members of a particular community in itself. It is important to understand that in a particular case where you are not sure as to how to approach an individual, it is very important to ask questions rather than committing the fallacy of making hasty generalisations. Tulsi from Karawal Nagar says, тАЬgive me any job other than about toilets and latrines. I want to change my life. I wish my husband was here to see his children grow up. I can make you meet so many women in my colony who still do it every day.тАЭ Tulsi disappears for 10 mins. She then comes back with a following of 11 women. They narrate how they work in twos. In the evening they throw the collected dump of latrines together. They make sure nobody is seeing them. Priya says, тАЬyou know there is a ban on plastic polythenes, that is why.тАЭ All these women want to open a vegetable mart one day. One of them smiles and says тАЬI went to a big mall with my Baaiji one dayтАжyes! It is called Big Bazaar.тАЭ They all agree and say that they want to open a Big Bazaar in Karawal Nagar in the coming November of this year. All of them then write their names on a paper. Tulsi is seen struggling with depression after the loss of her husband. She says sometimes she does not want to wake up for days. She too needs immediate psycho-social care with routine therapy and counselling. Individuals also have to assess whether opening a Mart in this area will be economically viable. Firstly, opening a Self Help Group to make these women understand the basics of accountancy and maintaining the registers of the business will make them understand the realities of running operations of a small business. In Trilokpuri, Preeti says, тАЬI will marry very soon and then I will not be here.тАЭ Preeti runs a small Computer Centre, her students adore her. Neeraj, one of her students says, тАЬMaтАЩam, I think you will be here, I think Sir may allow you to do a job again. Preeti is now completely dependent on her husband. She did not realise that she was financially independent before marriage. The opening of a Computer Centre was a great possibility for her to break out of the patriarchal system. Individuals can counsel her but they have to respect her choice. In Mangolpuri, Sumit also runs a Computer Centre, he says, тАЬthese days everyone has a smartphone, I donтАЩt know why we are still teaching differences between hardware and software. I think if I teach my students video editing on the phone then it will help them in making their videos and finding jobs in these startups. If you have a stable job you donтАЩt drink that much.тАЭ SumitтАЩs father is a seasonal manual scavenger. He says, тАЬBaba keeps drinking because he does this work. Anyone who cleans latrines day and night will drink. One day I went to pick up Baba in the evening, I saw him drenched in latrine and waste. I used to think he collects waste and dumps it nearby.тАЭ Sumit is right, other members of the same family where one member does the work of manual scavenging also do not understand the extent and scope of this work. Sumit says that he used to not understand why his father would drink so much. We need to rehabilitate both SumitтАЩs father and Sumit. Now that Sumit completely understands the suffering of his father it is possible to expand the Computer Centre where SumitтАЩs father can also work and learn from his son. His father needs the love and affection of his son more than psycho-social care. Individuals and institutions often force manual scavengers to give up drinking without understanding the sequence of problems. Many people who clean the dry latrines and septic tanks have to resort to drinking and drug abuse because of a deeper problem that spirals in the breaking up of family ties. It can lead to the formation of deep emotional scars. Here, the evaluative methodology of rehabilitation can help the individuals to also understand that one cannot force a member to leave their families without making the members understand the consequences of their actions. Sumit also says that he is afraid of bringing people who want to help them to his house as individuals repeatedly advise his mother to leave his father because his father beats her mother. In cases of domestic abuse and violence which have spiralled from the drinking habit of a member of a family, individuals need to assess and inform women that they need to acquire and sort their finances before leaving the abuser. The complete evaluative procedure of not imposing your own morality and asking a woman to leave without her own choice has to be refrained from. Here, the woman can be counselled, given psycho-social care and an emergency number but leaving a person has to be her choice. Hence, there should be a deeper understanding of the integration between different levels of social systems before trying to rehabilitate someone. We, as a society have to also free ourselves from тАШour saviour complex.тАЩ Here, institutions need to have a diversified team of people from all socio-economic backgrounds. The presence of all kinds of representations should be one of the most important goals of institutions. Another important aspect is that the people of the team should be highly trained through orientations on different techniques of interaction that lead to a total or integrated rehabilitation.

In yet another instance of caste violence during the lockdown in Tamil Nadu, a caste Hindu man allegedly told a 14-year-old Dalit boy to eat his own faeces and forced him to carry the excreta for five metres since the boy defecated on a patta land owned by the former. The incident reportedly took place in Pennagaram of Dharmapuri district. The landowner, Rajasekhar, also allegedly abused the Class 10 boy with casteist slurs and assaulted him with a cane to force him to carry the excreta to his house. Rajesekhar belongs to the Iyer caste while the boy is from the Adi Dravidar caste, a Scheduled Caste group in Tamil Nadu. Following the incident, the boy's father has given a complaint to the police, based on which a case has been registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act. According to the First Information Report accessed by TNM, the 14-year-old defecated in the open at 5 pm on July 15 as it was raining, on a land owned by Rajasekhar. On seeing the boy defecate on his land, Rajasekhar allegedly told him to eat the faeces and carry it in his hands. Rajasekhar also hit the boy with a cane to make him carry the excreta to his house, the FIR says. Fearing assault, the boy reportedly collected the faeces and walked for five metres till he reached home, the FIR adds. The humiliated boy is still unable to eat due to the incident, says his father. Talking to TNM, the father says, ├в┬А┬ЬIt was raining heavily on July 15 and my son got an umbrella from me and left home for defecating in the open. We have a toilet constructed by the Central government but we do not have water, so we defecate in the open. On that day also, my child was defecating on the land owned by Rajasekhar, when he passed by that way. On seeing the child, he immediately got down from the vehicle and started hitting my son with a cane for defecating in the open.├в┬А┬Э ├в┬А┬ЬRajasekhar told my son to eat the faeces since he had defecated on his land. He also uttered a casteist slur to my boy and told him to pick up the excreta with his hands,├в┬А┬Э alleges the father. Though a passerby tried to help the boy, Rajasekhar reportedly did not permit it. However, the passerby informed the father about what was going on. ├в┬А┬ЬBy then, my son just picked up the faeces and ran to our home. When I saw him, I was shocked to see him carrying the faeces. I asked him why he was carrying it and he told me that Rajasekhar had hit him and that he could not bear the pain,├в┬А┬Э the father says. ├в┬А┬ЬI immediately washed his hands. But still my child has not had food since he gets reminded of carrying the faeces in his hand,├в┬А┬Э adds the father. The Pennagaram Inspector said that the case is being handled by Pennagaram Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mehala. However, the DSP was unavailable for comment. The police have registered a case against Rajesekhar under Section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (1) (i) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.  ┬й2021 the news minute","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

After Dalit residents of Kodarampatti village in Pennagaram filed a petition, the Pennagaram police on Friday filed an FIR against the man, identified as K Rajasekar, under provisions of the SC/ST Atrocities Act for forcing a minor to undertake manual scavenging and for beating the child for trespassing into private land. According to the FIR, on Wednesday, the child was playing in the private land and defecated there. Rajasekar, the owner of the land, saw him and called out to him. When the 14-year-old approached him, the man allegedly started verbally abusing the child by his caste name. The FIR states that he pulled out a bamboo shoot, planted nearby, and thrashed the boy. It is alleged that Rajsekar then forced the child to eat the faeces. The 14-year-old, fearing further beatings, picked up the faeces and ran back to his home located some 15 metres away. The childтАЩs father told The New Indian Express that the boy is traumatised and has not spoken properly to even his family or friends since the incident. The boy had only defecated in the land because of the urgency of the situation. The child has also sustained physical injuries, he said. тАЬWe filed a complaint with Pennagaram police on Wednesday. They asked us to put the complaint in a petition box set up here because of the COVID-19 panic,тАЭ he said. Sub inspector M Mari looked into the complaint on Thursday and based on his investigation, an FIR was filed on Friday, said Periyar, the Pennagaram inspector. Periyar said Rajasekar has been booked under Section 323 of IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and under Section 3(j) of the SC/ST Act for forcing SC persons to do manual scavenging.

The first female Dalit (member of the Scheduled Caste, formerly known as тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ [1]) in her village to be enrolled in an undergraduate program, Preeti is anxiously waiting for the government to release the final tranche of her college scholarship. If it fails to do so, Preeti, who is in her final year of a Bachelor of Science program, will be forced to drop out. She is solely dependent on the scholarship to complete her college education. The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), IBPтАЩs partner in India, long has focused on the inequities faced by people like Preeti and has redoubled its work as the ravages of COVID-19 become apparentтАУincluding bolstering youth leadership. On March 24, the government of India announced a country-wide lockdown to check the spread of the virus [2]. Since then, all academic institutions in the country have been closed. Along with the pressures of the pandemic, the future prospects of Dalit students dependent on the scholarship scheme has been disproportionately affectedтАФjeopardizing the chances of Preeti and others like her for a path out of poverty and marginalization. тАЬIt is demoralizing and disempowering for those of us pursuing our PhD/graduate courses if we have to drop out of college and are forced to work as daily wage laborers in the unorganized sector. Our future depends on the timely release of the scholarship [funds],тАЭ says Preeti. The All India Survey on Higher Education for 2018-2019 reports that Dalits account for only 14.9% of the 37.4 million students enrolled in higher education. Most of these students are first generation-learners with no financial resources or social capital. Even those who make it into college face backlash from members of тАЬdominantтАЭ castes, as historically, for over 3000 years, education was denied to Dalits. The marginalization multiplies for Dalit women, who are at the bottom of caste, gender and class hierarchies and most often have no agency or support to overcome these systemic barriers. Recognizing the institutional discrimination faced by Dalit students, NCDHR is heavily investing in strengthening the collective agency and leadership skills of these students. The core of this intervention is the training and support of a group of student volunteers. In the Jalaun district, there are 30 student volunteers, 40% of whom are girls. They are the driving force of NCDHRтАЩs efforts and Preeti has been volunteering for the last three years. Despite the troubles Preeti herself faces during the lockdown, she has helped ease its strains on her community. For instance, many Dalits had travelled to cities across India for work, but have been forced to return to their villages. Among the states, Uttar Pradesh is one of the most challenged, with about 2.1 million migrants flooding home. With no food, money or assured mode of transport, migrants made the long trek by foot. The media have reported about 300 deaths by starvation across the country since the lockdown; however, this might be a conservative estimate. The World Bank estimates the lockdown has already impacted 40 million such internal migrants and the International Labor Organization cautions that 10 times this number (400 million) are at risk of falling deeper into poverty. As many as 85 Dalit migrant families made their way back to Bijapur, who then were ostracized by the dominant castes, who did not allow them to enter the village. Another challenge is that the World Health OrganizationтАЩs recommendation to practice social distancing collides with IndiaтАЩs caste system. Social distancing is traditionally a Brahminical diktat that sanctions the practice of тАЬuntouchabilityтАЭ and normalizes discrimination and violence against Dalits [3]. Preeti was quick to take initiative by interviewing migrants and creating a database of their immediate needs, including testing for COVID-19. She led a delegation of six student volunteers and advocated with the Pradhan of the Gram Panchayat (head of the village council), the sub-divisional magistrate and doctors in the primary health centre to provide immediate relief to the migrants. Preeti was persistent and followed up several times. As a result, health camps were organized, dry rations were distributed and shelter was provided in a government school for migrants who required 14 days of quarantine. The village of Bijapur is home to 1,300 inhabitants, most of whom are Dalit laborers living below the poverty line (less than INR 26 [$0.43] a day). Nearly half the families do not have access to the subsidized dry rations provided to all poor families through the governmentтАЩs Public Distribution System. Preeti and other student volunteers carried out a door-to-door survey to assess the number of families without the necessary documentation to receive the government COVID-19 relief packages. The volunteers shared the survey findings with authorities in the district administration. Along with NCDHRтАЩs local partner, Bundelkhand Dalit Adhikar Manch (BDAM), the student volunteers advocated with the district for immediate relief, as well as demanded that these poor households be employed as part of MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), thus providing some respite. The act ensures 100 days of minimum-wage employment every year for recipients. Due to the volunteersтАЩ consistent engagement, relief measures were provided to the poorest families and MGNREGA work started again in their villages. Preeti spearheaded the relief work in her village, Bijapur. Through her efforts, 50 families received dry rations and 15 senior citizens gained access to the governmentтАЩs pension scheme. Preeti applied for MGNREGA job cards for over 100 families, of whom 87 were successful. Also, as the leader of BDAMтАЩs womenтАЩs wing, Preeti raised awareness of the lack of access to sanitary napkins for adolescent girls. BDAM subsequently raised resources from a partner organization to provide these products to 150 girls across three villages in Jalaun district. Even as Preeti inspires with her dynamism, she continues to struggle to pursue her education. Due to the pandemic, academic institutions have shifted to digital modes of learning. Virtual lectures, online assignments, webinars and discussions are organized. However, in the absence of equitable access to digital infrastructure [4], including internet service, laptops and smartphones, students from poor and marginalized communities face extraordinary challenges. In light of this, Preeti and other student volunteers met the social welfare officer who implements the scholarship at the district level. The officer was receptive to their demand that the government provide basic digital infrastructure for Dalit students, but has yet to take necessary action. The students are afraid that if academic institutions continue providing classes online, it will push them out of the education system. Nonetheless, despite facing multiple barriers, Preeti and other student volunteers are pushing social boundaries and bringing about transformational change in their communities. Their association with NCDHR, BDAM and a larger community of student volunteers gives them the strength and resilience to navigate caste and patriarchy in their everyday lives. тАЬPeople here are not used to women raising their voices and engaging with the government to influence developmental outcomes. However, due to my efforts during the pandemic, people in the village who were earlier dismissive of my work now respect and look up to me as a leader,тАЭ explains Preeti. This reflects the gradual shift in power equations and socially accepted norms, especially regarding girlsтАЩ agency, education and leadership. The emerging social capital of women student leaders has the potential to change the status quo, but it must be nurtured and leveraged to encourage greater democratic participation, paving the way for inclusive and responsive governance at the grassroots.  [1] The caste system is based on degrees of тАЬpurityтАЭ and тАЬimpurity,тАЭ with the Brahmins at the top being the тАЬpurestтАЭ and the Dalits at the bottom perceived as тАЬpollutedтАЭтАФtherefore making them тАЬuntouchable.тАЭ [2] India ranks at the top in terms of stringency of government responses among 160 countries in an index developed by the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. [3] IndiaтАЩs caste system is the worldтАЩs longest-surviving social hierarchy, with Brahmins at the top and Scheduled Castes (including Dalits) at the bottom. The caste system sanctions discrimination and exclusion from sociocultural, economic and political life. [4] According to the 2017-18 National Sample Survey Report on Education, only 15% of rural and 42% of urban households have access to the internet. This points to a huge urban-rural divide in addition to gender, caste and class inequalities.   Your email address will not be published.

The investigating officer of the rape case said that based on the womanтАЩs complaint, an FIR was registered around June 20 and statement of the woman was recorded under section 164 CrPC. тАЬThe girl had alleged that the man had promised to marry her and then refused to do so.

Six persons have been detained in this connection. According to police, the victim has been identified as Pintu Galchar, a resident of Ravi village in Dhanera taluka, who was allegedly abducted from outside his house by a group of six men around 10 pm on July 16. On Friday, around 6 am, his naked body, with several injury marks, was found near a bus stand at a tri-junction road outside Ravi village. Galchar was employed as a daily wager and was unmarried, according to his family. Hours after the body was discovered, an FIR was filed at Dhanera police station and police detained six accused тАФ Hansraj Purohit, Chetan Purohit, Rama Purohit, Ramabhai Babuji Purohit, Kirti Purohit and Gautam Purohit тАФ who have been named in the FIR filed by the victimтАЩs brother. All six accused are residents of Dhanera village and they have been booked under Indian penal code sections 302 for murder, 364 for abduction, 294 for obscenity and 143 for unlawful assembly along with sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. тАЬAround 10 pm, Hansraj, Chetan, Ramabhai, Kirti and Gautam arrived in a Bolero Camper vehicle and forcefully took him away with them.

According to police, the victim has been unable to mention any motive behind the accused abducting Pintu, however, initial police probe has suggested that the accused might have suspected the victim of breaking into a shop at a marketplace in Dhanera recently. тАЬWe have now detained all six accused mentioned in the FIR and they are being interrogated.

On Thursday, however, she clicked a selfie with her sister, father and mother, inside their makeshift house that has a leaky roof. All of them smiled brightly. A new inanimate member is seen in the blurry family portrait, a Lenovo 7th Gen laptop. ""I feel proud,"" says this Dalit student, expressing a sentiment that would surprise us. It's entirely understandable, though. It had been merely a few hours since the laptop enterred Anakha's home in Nedunkandam in Idukki and memories of the struggle and legal battle to get the laptop are fresh in her mind. Anakha had applied for the laptop at the Panchayat, under a Kerala government scheme, two years ago. After running from pillar to post, hoping to get it sanctioned, the sisters approached the High Court, which ruled in their favour in June. The panchayat was to provide them with two laptops, one for each sibling, in five weeks. Anakha, undoubtedly, was elated. However, a couple of weeks back, Anakha and her mother found themselves in a helpless situation, when the panchayat members lashed out at them for going to court. ""You could have used that money to buy a laptop. Why do you trouble us?"" a panchayat member is heard asking Anakha's mother, in a voice recording that she shared with EdexLive. ""We were then told that they had placed an order with KELTRON and can't do anything apart from that,"" she says. However, after a sustained amount of attention from media and activists, Anakha received a call from KELTRON last week. ""Apparently, the panchayat had caused a delay in placing the order. Even though we had applied for it in 2018 and the court verdict was out on June 30, they placed the order only on July 9,"" she says. The laptop was finally delivered by a panchayat member on July 23. ""This laptop is the one approved for my sister, who is a student of physiotherapy. My laptop will be delivered in the first week of August,"" she says. Anakha says that this has made life much easier for her and her sister. ""My sister would otherwise receives her notes on WhatsApp. The video classes are set to begin in September. Now she can attend those classes, hassle-free,"" she says. And it couldn't have come at a better time. She has submitted her master's dissertation at the Sri Shankaracharya University of Sanskrit and is now preparing for her MPhil. ""I hope to do an MPhil and PhD after that. This laptop is my right,"" she says. During one of our previous conversations, Anakha had told me how she struggled to submit her dissertation, typing it out on a friend's old, faulty laptop. On Thursday, she wrote on Facebook, ""I have spent endless nights crying because I couldn't complete my dissertation. My parents were helpless. All that they could do was to cry alongside. The panchayat insulted my mother when she went there with the High Court's order. Our authorities and representatives should learn to grow as empathetic, responsible human beings."" She added, ""This isn't merely a laptop. This is our right to live in this country.""

Migrant worker Duleshawar Tandi found fame after his rap on migrant issues in the aftermath of the national lockdown, recorded and posted online from a damaged muddy hut, struck a chord with netizens. Hailing from one of the poorest places in India, Dule Rocker, as he is popularly known as, is a real-life тАШGully BoyтАЩ. The 27-year-old Dalit rapper had shifted to Raipur in search of work after graduating from college, no small feat for someone who came from a poor family. He moved back to his hometown to live with his mother just a day before the lockdown was announced and after seeing the troubles of workers walking hundreds of kilometres to reach home, he made a video rapping about the same. But it was another self-written rap song that he posted online in May that brought attention to him. He rapped with angst and anger about the governmentтАЩs lack of regard for the plight of poor migrant workers in Kosli (or Sambalpuri) language. PARI (PeopleтАЩs Archive of Rural India) tweeted a small video showcasing Tandi rapping. The tweet went viral and Tandi started gaining significant attention online.  TandiтАЩs sudden fame is especially surprising considering the fact that he hails from OdishaтАЩs Kalahandi, a district that is often struck by droughts, famine and poverty, so much so, that the term тАШKalahandi SyndromeтАЩ has come to be synonymous with backwardness and destitution. Tandi started rapping in his college days, later on giving it up when he needed money to support his family. His father died in 2017 and later on, his motherтАЩs illness forced him to take up odd jobs and eventually move to Raipur when he noticed his friends migrating to cities in search of menial jobs. Now that the country is in lockdown and migrant workersтАЩ issues are bubbling to the surface, Tandi is using his time to make rap videos whilst back in Kalahandi. тАЬI donтАЩt want to promote sleaze or liquor in my songs. Migrant workers like us have too many issues. Those things would find a place in my songs,тАЭ Tandi said. As his rap videos started gaining traction on social media, many from even the music industry praised him for his talents. Even Vishal Dadlani and Mumbai rapper Divine took to Twitter to applaud him.      This proves to be one of those times where the power of the Internet has been used for good. Tandi has now started getting offers from the Odia music industry. He continues to rap and post videos online. ItтАЩs good to see the medium of rap being used for spreading an important message and not just being used by the privileged classes.

The recent incident of a Dalit couple consuming pesticide and being assaulted by the police in Madhya Pradesh's Guna district is more horrific than the 2016 flogging of Dalits at Una in Gujarat, MLA Jignesh Mevani said on Saturday. A Dalit couple allegedly consumed pesticide while a drive was underway to evict them from government land on Tuesday. A video of the incident showed some police personnel purportedly beating up the husband with batons, leading to a huge outrage. The independent MLA from Gujarat has demanded that criminal cases be registered against police personnel involved in the July 14 incident. ""The Guna incident is more frightening than the Una incident in Gujarat. A five-month-old child of the victim couple was also pushed during the incident. What can be more inhuman than this?"" Mevani asked. He said if the guilty police personnel are not booked, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government will face a backlash during the upcoming Assembly bypolls. Mevani alleged that atrocities against Dalits have been on the rise since the BJP came to power in the state. ""The attitude of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is anti-Dalit and anti-farmer,"" he said. Mevani, MP Scheduled Castes Commission member Pradeep Ahirwar, and state Congress secretary Kiran Ahirwar visited the spot of the incident and also the couple in hospital. Ahirwar said Dalits are scared in the wake of the incident. He demanded compensation for the victims Rajkumar Ahirwar (38) and his wife Savitri Ahirwar (35). The state government had transferred Inspector General (Gwalior range), Guna collector and superintendent of police following the incident while six police personnel were suspended.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

The majority of the child labourers were not attending school. The report Sowing Hope, which examines child labour and wages in cotton and vegetable seed production in India, says that while still too high, the total amount of child labourers has in fact declined since 2015, due to initiatives by companies and NGOs. The report however does find that wages across the sector are still far from the minimum wage, a figure which has not improved significantly. The prevailing wage rates were found to be 24-41% below minimum wage in some Indian states. The researchers also found differential treatment of Dalits in the workplace with reports of Dalit workers being treated differently to dominant castes and not being given the same privileges in relation to taking breaks during work hours or being treated with respect and dignity. 613 sample farms were surveyed showing a direct correlation between the decline of child labour in companies who have implemented special programmes to address this issue in relation to those who have not yet tackled the problem. International Dalit Solidarity Network welcomed тАШSowing HopeтАЩ and urged companies looking to address child labour and the working conditions in the seed sector to address caste discrimination directly, as it is a key root cause of child labour, also evidenced by the large percentage of Dalits engaged in this work as documented. тАЬThis caste dimension is also witnessed in many other sectors including Leather, Stone and Minerals, Construction, Carpet Weaving as well as across the Garment and Agriculture sectors,тАЭ it said.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA
"439",4128,"http://twocircles.net/2020jul28/438352.html","22 years on, justice eludes Dalit victims of Bathani Tola massacre","By Nafis Haider, TwoCircles.net Bihar: On 11 July 1996, Bathani Tola was painted red with the blood of Dalits and poor farmers which included women, children, and aged people. Swords and axes were used to chop the heads of Dalits, their wives and daughters were raped and their breasts were chopped and children were killed in cold blood. The assailants did not even spare a pregnant lady who was raped and her womb slit open and killed. A total of 21 Dalits died in what came to be known as the Bathani Tola massacre. The attackers were members of an upper-caste armed group called Ranvir Sena. Established in 1993 and gaining momentum in 1994, Ranvir Sena is the most feared in the long list of upper caste armed groups who had established a de facto monopoly over the rural areas of Bihar from the 1990s up till 2012. The rise of Ranvir Sena can be seen as a reaction to the growth of self-respect and freedom against feudal mindset in the Dalit population through the awareness programs of CPI(ML) Liberation, especially Dipankar Bhattacharya, the youngest general secretary of the party. Ranvir Sena has openly claimed responsibility for numerous massacres and killings, which include Nadhi (Bhojpur) killing in 1996, Lakshmanpur-Bathe massacre of 1997, Shankarbigha (Jehanabad) massacre in 1999. Presently, though large scale massacres do not occur, daily exploitation and skirmishes continue. Local from Bathani Tolda talk about the murder of a Dalit at the hands of an upper-caste landlord, which caused tension between Dalits and Ranvir Sena in the area. An old veteran of Ranvir Sena spoke to TwoCircles.net about the need to maintain fear. He said, тАЬIf we do not keep the labourers in check, they will rise against us which will only cause violence and anarchy. It is necessary to use violence in order to protect dharma and societal norms.тАЭ When asked about the Bathani Tola massacre, he said, тАЬWe cannot see the events in singularity. Dalits were the first to attack us. We just responded to protect ourselves and the dharma.тАЭ Decades have passed but the hegemony of Ranvir Sena still holds centre stage in power relations, especially in Bhojpur, and adjacent districts. The locals told TwoCircles.net that each year on the anniversary of the Bathani Tola massacre, the members of Ranvir Sena staged a show to display their power and invoke the Dalits who marked 11 July as a day of mourning. The day becomes so intense that Police have to create a barricade between the upper caste dominated Barki Khadawon and the Dalit majority area of Bathani Tola to prevent violence and bloodshed.  Locals said that though the private militia of Ranvir Sena does not have a direct affiliation with any particular party, they do share close connections with members of BJP and RSS. тАЬThe links with politicians help them gain immunity from the police and maintain their power in the area. Politicians do not intervene since nobody wants to lose upper caste support,тАЭ locals said. This symbiotic relation helps to maintain the structure of feudalism in the state with Dalits as the oppressed. After the election of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Dalits found visibility but even then Ranvir Sena was able to maintain their hegemony since they hold the money and influence. The current Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar, who earlier found it difficult to build a strong base in Bhojpur district by being a lower caste, now has strong support among the Bhumihar and Rajput community after his coalition with BJP, who are supported by Ranvir Sena in Bihar. Krishna (name changed), a lower caste resident of Bhojpur district said that the charm of violence and the feudal tendency still occupy the mind of Bhumihars and Rajputs in Bhojpur. After the death of Brahmeshwar Singh, and the decline of CPI (ML) Liberation in the politics of Bihar, the atrocities from both sides in terms of massacres have seen a decline but the tension still exists, revitalized by the continuous struggle against suppression by the Dalits. A Delhi University student Aditya said that, тАЬSena says they are protecting us from the violence of CPI (ML) Liberation who still occupy many Sarkari (government) lands and want to turn the labourers against us.тАЭ Aditya added that anyone, even from the upper caste who speaks ill of the Sena is treated as a communist and socially isolated. тАЬThatтАЩs why no one ever speaks about their atrocities. Everyone has accepted their actions as necessary,тАЭ he said. In 2012, the Patna High Court acquitted all the 23 accused in the massacre, citing lack of evidence. Following the verdict, CPI (ML) Liberation called for a тАШBihar BandтАЩ and staged protests for the state government to take the case to Supreme Court. Nitish Kumar subsequently filed a petition in the Supreme Court where the case still awaits notice of hearing. The victims still have not received any substantial compensation and the area continues to be neglected in terms of development. The poverty among the Dalits and illiteracy bars them from outgrowing their traditional livelihood and they depend on the fields of the upper caste landlords which breed the cycle of suppression and domination along caste lines. Even after more than two decades, Ranvir Sena still roams with pride and maintains the hegemony on the land. The Dalits still fear their suppression and the victims of Bathani Tola still await justice. ","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

According to the police sources here, the members of the dead woman's family, who hailed from the 'Nat' community, whose members were 'acrobats' and also dancers and singers, had to take the body to a different cemetery for performing the last rites. ''Just as the woman's six year old son was about to light the pyre, a group of thakur community members reached there and asked us not to cremate the body there as the cremation ground was theirs,'' said a member of the 'Nat' woman's family. District police chief Babloo Kumar said that the matter was being investigated. ''The matter will be probed by a circle office....we will take stern action against the guilty,'' Kumar said. Sources, however, said that the 'Nat' family had not yet filed any written complaint with the police perhaps fearing a backlash from the upper caste members. BSP supremo Mayawtai slammed the incident and demanded a high-level probe into the same. ''It is shameful that a Dalit woman's body was not allowed to be cremated as the cremation ground belonged to the upper castes...the government must take stern action so that such incidents did not recur,'' Mayawati said on Tuesday.

"442",4166,"https://countercurrents.org/2020/07/ideological-logic-around-the-validity-of-dalit-patriarchy/","Ideological logic around the validity of ├втВм┼УDalit Patriarchy ├втВм┼У | Countercurrents"," Of late, I am coming across on the strange discussion on тАЬ Dalit Patriarchy тАЬ . I see a lot of confusion around this concept and this write up tries to delve deeper into the validity, rationality and viability of the concept on the established principles of creating an ideology. Feminism is considered as- тАЬ the advocacy of womenтАЩs rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes тАЬ . We should not have a deviation in understanding and appreciating what this feminism generally means to anyone. When it comes to the rights of women, there is no second question on being lenient on it on whatever grounds they may be placed on. The Indian society is complex with innumerable cross overs and that is how and why the conventional Marx is denied here , in an extent, as the interpretation of тАЬ OppressionтАЭ itself is quite viewed in an unconventional perspective. He picturises this society as something like тАУ people stay in each floor with no access to the other floor which is like тАШ neither you can go up nor you can go down тАШ. Our problem of classification of this society is not just people having caste as a culture in their тАЬbrainsтАЭ but it is the question institutionalisation and structural casteism. This leads us to conclude that the individual reformism is the last step to carry as someone has to break the barriers of social capital to augment. The gravity of the question of тАЬSocial capitalтАЭ can be seen from the fact that recent arrests in CAA/Bhima Koregaon issues are just to meant to isolate certain type of people carrying certain ideas from regular social life and treat them like aliens and , further, also creating an institutionalised scare amongst masses to carefully adjust their ideologies to suit Brahminism and fall in line with majoritarianist sections. Treatment of women in caste and class society Now, once we trust that we are all on same page having no qualms in admitting what AmbedkarтАЩs visualisation of the stratification of the society is right, we will have to see how women are put into institutionalised oppression in the whole gamut. In a general burgeosie class society , the women is confined and put in certain boundaries as they are perceived as under : Added to this, typically, this Indian society, having classical feudal ideologies rooted in its bourgeoise society, views women in the following respects Having agreed that we are a stratified society, which is essentially a closed stratified society, has enclosures around women too. A woman in one enclosure cannot be equated with the other woman because of varied social stratification. Thus though Brahmin women are considered to be more pious than Dalit women and much more revered than a Dalit woman, they are the ones who were excruciated by certain abominable traditions like тАЬ Sati тАЬ. This takes us to consider тАЬ Dalit Feminism тАЬ as a separate subject from regular тАЬ Feminism тАЬ. Dalit feminism primarily encompasses not just about womenтАЩs rights but also the question of social stratification of women too along with it, while general feminism puts every woman on par with each other. Women, in India, do not carry any independent identity for themselves except caste. Men pilots the caste and women nurtures the caste through тАЬ family structures тАЬ and тАЬ endogomy тАЬ. тАЬFamily тАЬ is the structure which nurtures caste in the society and тАЬFamily тАЬ lives on тАЬEndogomic principles тАЭ An upper caste woman can disown her husband but cannot disown her caste and she needs her caste to continue to elevate her identity in the society. She also wishes to live on the тАЬSocial CapitalтАЭ what her caste people augmented over a period of time. End of the day, when the family needs to move on in the society , the entire lineage is put to stake thus obstructing every family memberтАЩs progress. We must not confuse this intersection as the question of priority of problem of Dalit woman over the problem of тАЬFamily ( caste) тАЬ or vice versa The relevance of adding adjectives to тАЬPatriarchy тАЬ Patriarchy needs to be characterised by its dominance and power not at individual level alone but at institutional level. I think we have strong confusion in understanding a man and extrapolating this to a larger theory. The matter of man overpowering woman is a general patriarchal principle. . The question is that internal structural problems neither break the stratification nor secure the individual positioning for an assured good for all in the same social class. The Dalit man beating his wife or a Dalit boy teasing a Dalit girl are not specifically and specially institutionalised. There is no scriptural support, there is no specific State support , there is no privileged cultural support Dalit man enjoys in dominating Dalit woman. However, we need to agree that Dalit woman suffers caste as an institution while men are her immediate Patriarchal discouragement to her. That does not mean the Patriarchy has an adjective like тАЬ Dalit тАЬ preceding тАЬ Patriarchy тАЬ. When you put тАЬDalit тАЬ preceding тАЬPatriarchyтАЭ you want to vilify a particular social status as an inherent feature to the тАЬPatriarchy тАЬ. The irony is that тАЬDalit тАЬ does not carry any such features which can qualify to be an тАЬadjective тАЬ phrase. If someone means that Dalit boy harassing a dalit woman is what is тАЬDalit тАЬ here in the entire patriarchal game, their outlook of philosophy is definitely blundered. Dalit man is not harassing a girl because she is dalit nor he is taking advantage of a situation that he is тАЬDalit тАЬ. Dalit is not a privileged position . тАЬDalitтАЭ is not an empowered dominance. I can completely understand the confusion surrounding this sort of Patriarchy. Before, we further consider how to name this, we need to satisfy ourselves how to accept this тАЬ Dalit Patriarchy тАЬ ? Let us consider a case тАУ I know a Dalit boy teasing an OBC girl. If someone wants to put a frame to it and label it, can they club this and say it is тАЬDalit Patriarchy тАЬ ? Thus the argument to promote the concept of тАЬDalit PatriarchyтАЭ looks ridiculous. This does not be construed as тАУ Dalit man who harasses a Dalit woman is right and he needs to be sympathised, which we have clearly spelt out in the prologue to this write up. How to view a Dalit man harassing a Dalit woman either in the family or outside ? A Dalit man is harassing Dalit woman because he knows well that the stigmatisation woman suffers is more rising out of her confrontation and hence she tries to adjust her position close to a тАЬcompromiseтАЭ reckoning the cost benefit analysis of тАШ retaliation тАШ and тАШ compromise тАШ. Now which Dalit framed rules for such sort of majoritarianist perspective ? or which Dalit institution, if any, has built a ground of support for such attitude ? In the absence of answers to these questions, we would not be doing a justice to the problem by identifying it with an adjective тАЬDalitтАЭ around this Patriarchy. This is a generic Patriarchy in any society. Especially, this conflict is happening is within the caste enclosure. All the sub-systems in caste society have generic bias for men. It looks silly to ask ourselves that does Dalit Patriarchy imply тАУ Dalit woman , first, needs to fight Dalit men before they fight caste ? When that is not the perspective, what additional purpose the тАЬDalit тАЬ serves to categorise тАЬPatriarchy тАЬ as тАЬDalit тАЬ? This is a problem generic to every low class section in every society. There is Black feminism but there is no Black Patriarchy. It is true that Dalit man enjoys certain privileges over Dalit woman in terms of social status, employability etc. However, Where does he use his privilege against ? If you study the isolated tribes in any continent, you will see a patriarchy. Even the western class society does not categorise тАЬPatriarchyтАЭ into тАЬUpper Class Patriarchy тАЬ and тАЬ Lower Class Patriarchy тАЬ. That simply makes тАЬDalit Patriarchy тАЬ as a funny oxymoron. The need to understand a generic Patriarchy is relevant here before anyone feels pressure to join any adjectives to it. The fundamental mistake anyone is doing in the whole debate is to consider (i) тАЬwomenтАЭ as one тАЬhomogenous group ; and (ii) hypothesising that women on standalone basis, are socially mobilizable. Had this been the basis, Marx and Lenin would have formulated theories on тАЬProletariat Women DictatorshipтАЭ rather than тАЬProletariat Dictatorship тАЬ. In fact neither Ambedkar nor Marx , if not wrong Lenin too, never used the term тАЬ feminism тАЬ because its theories do not have independent political existence except for identity attestation, if not, identity affirmation. We may be able to annihilate caste and class in any foreseeable long future but obliterating the Patriarchy out of this society is farther dream than it is, which may be a fact difficult to digest looking to the history. That should not discourage us to undermine the question of women ( Lenin preferred to use this phrase rather ) , which should be paramount in our thinking, treatment and positioning.

"444",4186,"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/california-regulators-sue-cisco-over-discrimination-against-dalit-employee-107598","California regulators sue Cisco over discrimination against Dalit employee"," Follow Us Epaper Login / Register  A - A +  Cisco's treatment of the employee violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 A - A + Updated At: Jul 02, 2020 05:33 PM (IST) The company said will defend against the allegations in the complaint. Source: Twitter.   New York, July 2 California regulators have sued Cisco Systems, saying an engineer faced discrimination at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters because he is a Dalit Indian. India's caste system long placed Dalits at the bottom of a social hierarchy, once terming them ""untouchables."" Inequities and violence against Dalits have persisted for decades after India banned caste discrimination. The engineer worked on a team at Cisco's San Jose headquarters with Indians who all immigrated to the US as adults, and all of whom were of high caste, according to the lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The ""higher caste supervisors and co-workers imported the discriminatory system's practices into their team and Cisco's workplace,тАЭ the lawsuit says. It says Cisco's treatment of the employee, who is not named, violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California's Fair Employment and Housing Act. The Civil Rights Act bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. The lawsuit notes the employee is Dalit Indian, and that he is darker-complexioned than non-Dalit Indians. ""It is unacceptable for workplace conditions and opportunities to be determined by a hereditary social status determined by birth,тАЭ said DFEH Director Kevin Kish. Two men who were Cisco supervisors and higher-caste Indians, Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella, are named in the suit for discriminating and harassing the employee. The employee received less pay and fewer opportunities, and when he opposed тАЬunlawful practices, contrary to the traditional order between the Dalit and higher castes, Defendants retaliated against him,тАЭ the lawsuit says. Cisco did not step to prevent this discrimination, the suit says. The suit says that Iyer told other workers that the employee was Dalit and enrolled at India's prestigious Indian Institute of Technology through affirmative action. The employee contacted Cisco human relations, wanting to file a discrimination complaint against Iyer, and then Iyer took away his responsibilities and made other changes that reduced the employee's role and made him feel isolated from his coworkers. The suit says Iyer disparaged the employee to coworkers and said they should avoid him. After Iyer stepped down, Kompella replaced him, and the suit says Kompella тАЬcontinued to discriminate, harass, and retaliateтАЭ against the employee, including by тАЬgiving him assignments that were impossible to complete under the circumstances.тАЭ The lawsuit says that Cisco investigated and did not тАЬsubstantiate any caste-based or related discrimination or retaliationтАЭ against the employee. Cisco Systems Inc., a major supplier of computer networking gear that makes the internet work, said in a statement that it is committed to an inclusive workplace. It said it has тАЬrobust processes to report and investigate concerns raised by employees,тАЭ which it followed in this case, and that it is in compliance with all laws and its own policies. The company said will defend against the allegations in the complaint. Cisco spokeswoman Helen Saunders declined to say if Iyer and Kompella were still at Cisco, referring a reporter to LinkedIn. тАФ AP Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

On 28 June, the Punjab Police registered a first-information report against the girl. COURTESY BIKKAR SINGH JATINDER KAUR TUR24 July 2020  A morning routine of paying obeisance and performing sewaтАФserviceтАФat a local gurduwara, went nightmarishly wrong for a ten-year-old girl, a Mazhabi Sikh resident of Rampura village, in PunjabтАЩs Sangrur district. The Mazhabi Sikhs are a community of Dalits who converted to Sikhism. Early morning on 27 June, the girl went to perform sewa at the village gurudwara. According to her family, she had been visiting the gurudwara for sewa regularly since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic because her school was shut. But when the ten-year-old returned to the gurudwara the next morning, she found its management committee, and members of various Sikh religious and political outfits waiting to confront her. They accused her of committing sacrilege by tearing pages from the Guru Granth SahibтАФthe sacred Sikh text that is regarded by the community as an eternal living GuruтАФon the previous day. The crowd interrogated her for a couple of hours before calling the police. On 28 June, officials from the local Bhawanigarh police station registered a first-information report against the ten-year-old girl for sacrilege under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code. The provision criminalises тАЬdeliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.тАЭ According to the minorтАЩs parents, the girl and her family spent three nights in illegal police custody, and the child has been forced to hide at her relativeтАЩs house in a nearby village out of fear for her security. To inquire how a ten-year-old girl could be accused of such a crime while performing sewa, and made to undergo such an ordeal, I visited Rampura and met her family, the gurudwaraтАЩs leadership, local villagers and the police. Multiple police officials involved in the case said that the girl had been booked to pacify Sikh organisations and to prevent any violence or untoward incident. тАЬAsal vich eh jathebandian, religious matter nu bahut uchaal diyan neтАЭтАФThese Sikh groups have made a big issue about such religious mattersтАФone senior official told me on the condition of anonymity, adding that the police thought the girl and her family were innocent. Sandeep Garg, the senior superintendent of police of Sangrur, said that the police are investigating if the tearing off the pages was intentional or accidental. тАЬMost likely she has done it accidentally only,тАЭ he said, further noting that the police is also investigating whether the child had been instigated to commit the act. Garg and the gurudwara committeeтАЩs members claimed that the girl could be seen tearing the pages in the CCTV footage. But I saw the video, and the Guru Granth Sahib was not visible in it, and the footage did not show the ten-year-old commit the act that she was accused of. The girlтАЩs parents told me that their entire family of four, including their seven-year-old son, were detained at the police station for three nights, from 28 June to 1 July, without being produced before a court. Criminal procedure prohibits the police from detaining anyone for over 24 hours without producing them before a magistrate. Moreover, Section 83 of the IPC states that no act by a child between the age of seven and 12 is an offence unless she has тАЬattained sufficient maturityтАЭ to judge and understand its тАЬnature and consequences.тАЭ Given these circumstances, and the apparent consensus among the police that the girl was not culpable for the offence, it is unclear why the police registered an FIR in the case at all. The FIR against the girl states that the offence occurred between 5 am on 27 June and 1.50 pm the next day. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint by Hardev Singh, the president of the Rampura gurudwaraтАЩs management committee. Hardev said that when he went to pay obeisance at the gurudwara on 27 June, the Granthi Manpreet SinghтАФa priest who acts as custodian of the Guru Granth SahibтАФbrought the sacrilege to his notice and that of other members of the committee, Malkit Singh, Mukand Singh and Malwinder Singh. The complainant said that the Granthi told them that page numbers 641 to 654 of the sacred text were torn at the bottom. He added that the committee then looked at the footage of a CCTV camera inside the gurudwara, which they believed showed the ten-year-old deliberately desecrated the Guru Granth Sahib. The next day, Singh filed the complaint at the Bhawanigarh police station. The local police officials denied that the family was kept in police custody for four days. Legal procedure, as prescribed under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, mandates that as soon as the police apprehend a child for an alleged offence, she must be given to the custody of a special police unit for juveniles or a child-welfare officer. The act further states that barring exceptional circumstances, the child must be released on bail immediately, and alternatively, she should be placed in an observation home. The law expressly notes, тАЬIn no case, a child alleged to be in conflict with the law shall be placed in a police lockup or lodged in a jail.тАЭ Arshbir Singh Johal, the legal-cum-probation officer of Sangrur districtтАЩs juvenile-justice administration, told me the Bhawanigarh police did not hand over the custody of the girl and that she was not brought to the observation home at any point. He added that an FIR should not have been registered in the case at all, because the rules mandate that a case should only be registered in case of heinous offences. тАЬIn this case an FIR is registered under Section 295A, which is wrong because as per Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 it falls under the category of petty offence and only DDR was to be registered.тАЭ He was referring to the daily diary report, in which the police record every complaint before the station in a diary maintained at the police station. But according to the police, the hostility towards the girl that they witnessed on the morning of 28 June led them to register the FIR. Upon reaching the gurudwara for sewa that morning, the ten-year-old was met by the gurudwara committee, members of the political party Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann), and local representatives of the Damdama Sahib TakhtтАФone of five temporal seats of SikhismтАФand the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee, which manages gurdwaras across several states of the country. тАЬThe committee members and knowledgeable people from the village were present in the early morning hours,тАЭ the Granthi Manpreet told me. According to a second police official, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, leaders of various political parties and people reached there тАЬat the speed of bullets,тАЭ and subjected the ten-year to an aggressive interrogation. тАЬThe atmosphere at the time was highly volatile,тАЭ the second official said. тАЬSome of the people had even drawn their swords out.тАЭ Manpreet discussed how the ten-year-old used to perform sewa at the gurudwara. тАЬThe girl belongs to this village and hails from Mazhabi Sikh community,тАЭ he said. тАЬShe used to come for sewa, and took the opportunity when no sangatтАЭтАФdevoteesтАФтАЬwere around.тАЭ When I asked whether he believed that she did it deliberately, he claimed that there must have been somebody who instigated her to commit the act. This appeared to be a common perception. Hardev, the gurudwara committee president, told me, тАЬThat Dalit girl had been coming for the past ten-twelve days.тАЭ He added, тАЬWhile the Granthi took a break for refreshments and after the women who came to pay obeisance also went back, she tore off the pages.тАЭ Yet, all of them appeared to support the registration of the FIR. тАЬThis could have been averted, but such are the people that they target the weak and nobody dares to say a word to the mighty,тАЭ the second police official said, referring to the religious leaders who pressurised the police to lodge an FIR. Tejinder Kaur, the chairperson of the Punjab State Commission for Scheduled Castes, said she would seek a report from the district authorities about this incident. тАЬI was shocked to hear about such absurdity, first on the part of the public and then the way the case has been handled and the ten-year-old child booked for sacrilege,тАЭ Kaur told me. тАЬDoes a ten-year-old even know what sacrilege is? The life and rights of such a small child should be protected at all costs. The police cannot attribute actions like lodging the FIR against the ten-year-old to pressure.тАЭ The ten-year-old was subjected to questioning by the religious leaders at the gurudwara without her parents present, as they were only called and asked to come there a couple of hours later. When I visited the ten-year-oldтАЩs house, only her parents were present and the girl was at her relativeтАЩs place for her safety. The ten-year-old came from a poor family. The girlтАЩs mother worked as an agricultural labourer while her father worked with a carpenter as a daily wager, earning just Rs 300 per day, and managing to find work on only five to seven days in a month. When I reached their house, .the girlтАЩs mother was working in the fields. Knee-deep in mud, she rushed to wash it off before speaking with me. тАЬWe did not know what had happened that day,тАЭ she said. тАЬWe just reached the gurudwara when they called us.тАЭ The girlтАЩs father told me that the entire family was then quizzed by the gurudwara management committee for two or three hours. тАЬThey told us that our daughter tore off the pages. Then we were sent to the police station.тАЭ According to the father, the police repeatedly asked them whether someone had forced the girl to commit the act, or if the family held any grudge against anybody. тАЬWe have no issues with anybody,тАЭ he said. When asked how long the family was kept in police custody, she responded, тАЬfourтАУfive days.тАЭ Both the parents emphasised that the police did not beat or harass them. On 1 July, they said, the girl and her mother were taken to the juvenile-justice board for a hearing, which granted her bail immediately. They were taken back to the police station and told by the police to flee the village. тАЬWe were told to run away lest we are killed by the Sikh organisations,тАЭ the girlтАЩs father told me. тАЬThen we somehow managed to flee with our faces and heads covered.тАЭ The family went and stayed at their relativeтАЩs house in a nearby village, and the parents returned with their seven-year-old son after around two weeks. There does not appear to be much evidence to establish that the girl was responsible for the incident. According to the gurudwara committee, the CCTV footage showed her tearing the pages while folding the rumalaтАФa silk cloth used to cover the Guru Granth Sahib. тАЬThe girl was shown the CCTV recording and admitted that the pages got twisted by her but did not admit who asked her to do so,тАЭ Manpreet said. But upon viewing the footage, I noticed that the alleged tearing took place at a spot that was not visible in the recording. In the footage, the ten-year-old girl can be seen walking inside the gurudwara and sweeping the premises, but the sacred book was kept in a location that was out of the cameraтАЩs field of view. When confronted with this detail, the anonymous police official conceded that the alleged act was not visible in the CCTV footage. But the SSP Garg, who had claimed that the ten-year-old could be seen tearing the pages in the CCTV recording, did not respond to my queries when I sent him a copy of the footage and asked him to pinpoint the exact time at which this could be seen. Manpreet, however, insisted that the ten-year-old had torn the pages. He said the footage showed the child entering the gurudwara without covering her head, which he emphasised was her first mistake. тАЬThen she bows along with other women before taking up the broom. She then goes to the place where Guru Granth Sahib is kept and picks a JantriтАЭтАФalmanacтАФтАЬand then touches the rumalas over the Guru Granth Sahib, and then tears off the pages.тАЭ When I asked whether it was not possible that the girl was just performing sewa and tore the pages, which are large and heavy to flip, by accident, he said that the police is supposed to enquire into these points. JULY 2020 тАЬThis is not one odd incident,тАЭ Manpreet claimed. тАЬWe got the news of sacrilege in Rajasthan. We get to hear two or three such news items every month.тАЭ He provided no explanation for how he had connected an incident from Rajasthan to a minor girlтАЩs unproven crime in his village. Manpreet also stressed that the girlтАЩs parents did not tender an apology or express resentment over the episode. тАЬThe parts of Maharaj were cut deep,тАЭ he said, implying the ten-year-old had cut the Sikh guru. Kiranjot Kaur, a senior SGPC member and its former general secretary, condemned the behaviour meted out to the girl and her family. тАЬSince when has Sikhi become so fragile that a ten-year-old girl becomes a victim of the current disrespecting Guru Granth Sahib narrative?тАЭ Kaur asked. According to her, there has been a long build up to the тАЬpresent paranoia about sacrilege.тАЭ She added, тАЬPeople have grown suspicious and it has also become a fund raising opportunity for some Sikh organisations who build up pressure and fear psychosis in name of Sikhi. In the case of the ten-year-old child, many agree in private conversations that what happened was inappropriate, yet most of them back out from saying so publicly.тАЭ Kaur continued, тАЬSometimes when a Bir becomes oldтАЭтАФa term used to refer to a copy of the Guru Granth SahibтАФтАЬthe paper starts disintegrating simply by touching. I wonder if this possibility was examined before coming down heavily on a girl child who was regularly doing sewa in the gurudwara. The behaviour meted out to her and her family reeks of Talibani approach, which is contrary to Sikh thought.тАЭ RS Bains, a human-rights advocate, said that the police had committed an offence by arresting a ten-year-old child for beadbi, or sacrilege, because the idea of the Guru Granth Sahib being a living Guru is such a complex concept that a child can hardly make sense of it. тАЬWhere is the intention of a child, which is first requirement of the law dealing with crime?тАЭ Bains asked. He also questioned how the police succumbed to pressure and decided to register an FIR against the ten-year-old. тАЬDoes that mean a dozen people gathering and threatening to throw the law-and-order situation out of control entitles the police to frame an innocent in an FIR, to pacify those who outnumber an innocentтАФin this case, a small girl?тАЭ The police appear to have begun a process of rectification. Sukhdev Singh, the investigating officer in the case, told me that they had begun the process to close the case. тАЬWe have set the case towards cancellation,тАЭ he said. Sukhdev said that the village panchayat had stated in writing to the police that keeping in mind the girlтАЩs future, they would accept whatever decision the police would take in the matter. The second police official who requested anonymity told me, тАЬThey are a Sikh family, she is a child, this should not have happened. But under pressure, we had to do this.тАЭ тАЬWhat happened to us was very bad,тАЭ the girlтАЩs mother told me on 17 July. тАЬWe are poor people.тАЭ She said that her daughter was initially very scared and would constantly be crying, but has started feeling better recently. тАЬShe didnтАЩt share anything with us and just kept repeating that the pages got torn,тАЭ the mother continued. тАЬShe was questioned about who had told her to tear the pages, but how could she take any name when there was nobody behind this whole thing?тАЭ The juvenile-justice board had listed the case for 22 September, but if the investigating officerтАЩs assurances are to be believed, the police would shut the case down much before that. Yet, it appears that significant damage may already have been done. тАЬWe are still scared because of the way people and the committee members look at us,тАЭ the ten-year-oldтАЩs father said.

The Dalit man accidentally touched the bike of a caste hindu, for which he, along with his family were lynched by an angry mob. The gruesome video shows more than 15 men surrounding the man who lies helplessly on the ground, stripping him and beating him with slippers and sticks even as he cries out in pain. After he was assaulted, the man reached the police station to file a complaint and narrated the horror unleashed on him. тАЬAn atrocity case was reported in Talikote yesterday about assault on the Dalit Man from Minaji village. It was alleged that when he accidentally touched the bike of a man who belonged to the upper caste that he and his family members were assaulted by some 13 men,тАЭ said senior police officer Anupam Aggarwal, NDTV reported. Thirteen people were named in the complaint and have been booked under SC/ST act and various other appropriate sections under the Indian Penal Code. Some of the accused have been taken to the police station for questioning. Some villagers even allege that the man purportedly misbehaved with a few women.

According to the reports, this appalling incident has happened on July 15 in Pennagaram, Dharmapuri district where the landlord had reportedly abused the boy, who defecated on the land owned by the former. Landlord Rajasekhar has allegedly forced the boy to carry the excreta to his house and at one extent, the landlord asked the boy to eat his own faeces. A 14-year-old boy is studying tenth standard and following the incident, the boy informed his father about what has happened after which his father filed a complaint in a police station. The reports say that the boy has defecated on Rajasehkar's land at 5 pm on July 15. Based on the complaint, the police has filed an FIR against the landlord in which it has been stated that Rajasekhar has reportedly hit the boy and asked him to carry the excreta to his house, after seeing the boy had defecated on his land. After being forced by the upper caste man, a Dalit boy has carried the faeces on his hands and walked for five meters and reached his home and he informed his father, who shocked to see his son carrying the faeces on his hands. He moved to the police and lodged a complaint and based on his complaint, the police have booked an FIR against Rajasekhar under sections 323 - Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1) (i) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

The case underscores the need for legislation outlawing caste-based discrimination in countries with South Asian diaspora communities such as the US and UK. Tech giant Cisco is facing allegations that the company has not taken proper action to stop caste discrimination within its workforce. The case underscores the need for legislation outlawing caste-based discrimination in countries with South Asian diaspora communities such as the US and UK. The federal lawsuit by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), alleges that dominant caste managers at CiscoтАЩs San Jose headquarters campus, which employs a predominantly South Asian workforce, harassed, discriminated, and retaliated against an engineer because he is a Dalit. тАЬIt is unacceptable for workplace conditions and opportunities to be determined by a hereditary social status determined by birth,тАЭ said DFEH Director Kevin Kish. тАЬEmployers must be prepared to prevent, remedy, and deter unlawful conduct against workers because of caste.тАЭ The lawsuit against Cisco is a landmark case because it is the first civil rights case in the US where a governmental entity is suing an American company for failing to protect caste oppressed employees and creating a hostile workplace. In the UK, Parliament has acknowledged the existence of caste-based discrimination and equality legislation to prevent this was introduced and approved in 2013. However, this legislation is yet to be implemented and is in danger of being repealed. In the US there is no legislative framework to address caste-based discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. With large South Asian diaspora communities in these countries, it has been documented on many occasions that caste discrimination transcends borders and needs to be addressed wherever it occurs. тАЬIn countries like the UK and the US, anti-caste laws are necessary because we cannot change a casteist mindset overnight, but we can we can try and change casteist behaviour by making that behaviour unlawful,тАЭ said Meena Varma, Executive Director of the International Dalit Solidarity Network. Anti-caste discrimination bodies in the UK and US have been working hard to push for legislative measures and policies addressing caste to be adopted. The Coalition of American Ambedkarites Organizations has also released a statement on the Cisco case. тАЬAs the subcontinental population has increased exponentially over the last couple of decades, and that too in strategic positions in the American corporate bastion, our worst fears are coming true where caste plays a most decisive role in every walk of life,тАЭ the statement reads. The statement also calls for caste-specific policies to be implemented in organisations with South Asian workers as well as global organisations operating in countries with a presence of caste-based structures. IDSN member, the Dalit Solidarity Network UK is actively advocating for the implementation of anti-caste discrimination legislation in the UK and IDSN works with companies to promote the introduction and implementation of anti- caste policies and measures in operations and supply chains in caste-affected countries. We hope that this case will help further the understanding in the corporate sector for the need to look at addressing caste specifically.

Sudha Muttal is one of those people who fought many odds to carve a niche for herself as a theatre artist. Coming from a family of Dalits, she had to face several obstacles тАФ but she did not let the caste discrimination or financial constraints come in her way. This 29-year-old theatre artist narrates her tale, ""No one would believe that caste discrimination existed and still exists in the education sector. I studied in a government school and we were always made to sit on the last bench. I remember teachers gave a lot of importance to students who came from upper caste or rich families and ignored students belonging to the economically backward classes or were Dalits. This ignorance grew to the extent that my friends and I left the school when we were in Class VII. We chose to do menial jobs and started working in fields and would tend to the cattle and so on. We would not earn much but at that point in time, the money was enough to fill our stomachs.""  As days passed by, Sudha got used to the routine and she worked in the fields without any complaint. She even worked at a construction site to earn money to support her family. But little did she know that her future would change drastically because of the interference of one of her teachers. Sudha explains, ""I don't remember the exact year, but Government of India started Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya in our village Bannikoppa in Koppal. And they enrolled all the girl students, especially those who were school dropouts from poor families. One of the teachers who taught me in the government primary school enrolled me in the KGBV."" And life just changed all at once. She adds, ""I think this was the turning point in my life because whatever I am today is all because of this school. Since it was a residential school for girls, there was no question of meeting my parents every day. It was tough to be away from my family but it made my life more disciplined. I learnt yoga, vocal music, dance and drama which shaped my future. I participated in every school level and taluk level competition and won several prizes. Soon after completing Class X, I did my PU at a government college in Koppal.""  Before Sudha could opt for higher studies, she had to choose a stream that would get her a job and put her talent to use. That's when Sakhi, an NGO that works to empower youth and rural women, came to her rescue. ""Sakhi handheld me in many ways but this was not the first time that I met them. They had trained me in dance and drama during my high school days and realised that I had the potential to be a great actor. The NGO had also paid my school fees when my parents couldn't afford to pay. Hence, they suggested that I pursue a Diploma in Theatre from Ranga Adhyayana Kendra in Kundapura. My elder sister, who worked as a librarian, encouraged me to take up the programme but my parents were sceptical of whether it would secure my future. I did not heed what others thought and went ahead and did it."" At Ranga Adhyayana Kendra, Sudha learnt the nuances of acting, facial expressions, dialogue delivery and honed her skills. But even before she pursued that diploma, Sudha got a break in theatre at the Rangayana in Mysuru in 2010. Malegalalli Madumagalu, a novel by Rashtrakavi Kuvempu was adapted as a play that went on for nine hours and consisted of 300 actors. Sudha, who has since been a part of this production more than 50 times, says, ""I played the character of Subbanna Hegde's daughter Manjamma. I can never forget this play and my experience as an amateur artist. In fact, many people still recognise me as Rangayana's Manjamma.""  After the diploma, she was lucky enough to find work doing what she loved, ""Soon after completing the diploma in 2012, I started working for the government. The state government hires artists on contract basis and give them a salary to be part of various projects. Here, we not only enact plays for entertainment but also work on projects designed to create awareness among people. The most recent one that we enacted was the life of Mahatma Gandhi to commemorate his 150th birth anniversary,"" she states. Sudha travelled across India performing thousands of shows and gaining recognition. Gradually, her parents and villagers started respecting her and showcased her as a role model for many youngsters. People in her village, who had once mocked her for being a Dalit, would now boast of Sudha's accomplishments. ""No one will believe me if I tell them that Dalits were made to wait to fetch water from the lake. We had to wait until a particular person from a upper caste would come and pour water in our vessels and pots. Now, this practice has been abolished but it took so many years of hard work to deliver a message that Dalits can also achieve anything,"" says Sudha, whose dreams are beyond anyone's imagination.  What dreams, you wonder? Sudha's dream was to start an academy that can train people in her district in all the forms of art. Towards this end, she started her own organisation called Aksharadavva Savithri Bhai Phule Kalaranga Samsthe in 2018. This NGO was started to empower many Dalit youngsters and women like her. ""Bannikoppa is a highly backward and agrarian region in Koppal. There are many families and people like me and art is the only medium to bring them to the forefront. Being financially backward, it is not easy for them to afford to learn music, dance or acting. That's why I taught them dance and music. Meanwhile, the school-going girls learnt acting and dance. Simultaneously, I started a night school for illiterate women. According to me, these women should know to read and write basic Kannada. If someone hands over a legal document to them and asks them to sign ot, they must be capable of reading it. Around 60 people joined my night school wanting to read and write."" Besides acting, music, dance, Sudha has learnt traditional forms of art like dolly kunita and kamsale which were once performed only by men. Isn't it a sign of women empowerment? Now, her team that comprises young girls has learnt these forms and they go around performing in different villages and cities. Sudha proudly tells us, ""The money that we earn is invested back into our group. Recently, we started a Stree Shakti Scheme to apply for bank loans. The middle-aged and old women want to start a small scale business at home instead of working to earn meagre amounts in fields. But due to the pandemic, all the work is on hold. We hope the situation of uncertainty will clear soon and our group goes around performing across the state.""

The Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi joint action committee leaders Siva Reddy and Tirupati Rao paid tributes to the deceased farmer and consoled his family members.  Tirupati Rao said that the family members of the farmer should not get disheartened and the JAC would extend the support to them. He said that the farmers, who donated their land for the capital city, had been agitating for Amaravati. However, after the announcement of shifting of the capital city, they are depressed over the issue.  Dalit JAC leader Gaddam Martin Babu described the death of Nagulu as ""murder by the government"". The Dalits were half dead when the GO 41 was cancelled and they had been finding it hard to digest when the government ordered that the land should not be sold or purchased. Nagulu is survived by two daughters who are yet to be married and they do not have even a house, he said and demanded the government to come to the rescue of the family of Nagulu.  ┬й 2021 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

(Photo: News18) A Dalit man was beaten and his head tonsured at Seethanagaram police station, in Andhra Pradesh's East Godavari district on Sunday night. The incident occurred after the victim, Prasad, was taken to the police station following an alleged confrontation with a local YSRCP leader. Prasad was admitted to the Rajahmundry government hospital for treatment. A sub-inspector and a constable have been suspended and the police have also registered a case against Prasad for stopping the truck of a local YSRCP leader. ""My relative had passed away on Sunday. We were performing the last rites. During this, a truck was trying to move through my street. As last rite formalities were taking place, I and three others stopped the movement of the sand truck and we asked the truck driver to wait for some time until the body was moved from the place. This led to an argument,"" Prasad told reporters. He added that an hour after the incident took place, the YSRCP leader came to his residence and issued threats for stopping his truck. ""A day after this incident, sub-inspector police Shaik Feroze Shah, along with two other constables, took me and two others to the police station for investigation,"" He added. Prasad alleges that the SI had punched him and thrashed him with a belt. ""The SI later called a barber, got my head tonsured, and my moustaches removed,"" he said.  Opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu, while reacting to the incident, said that 'jungle raj' had returned to Andhra Pradesh. ""Vara Prasad's head was tonsured by leaders belonging to YCP in East Godavari District's Seethanagaram Police Station. All this happened in the presence of policemen who heckled and beat the man to a pulp, destroying the self-esteem of a Dalit man. His only mistake was to question the illegal sand mining in the region,"" he wrote on Twitter. He further questioned why the Andhra Pradesh police had become ""toys in the hands of corrupt ruling partymen."" ""This is a serious violation of rights. Telugu Desam will stand with Vara Prasad and make sure those responsible for this barbarian act be strictly punished,"" he added. The Andhra Pradesh DGP has initiated an inquiry into the matter and suspended the SI and constable over allegations of beating the man.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

The shocking incident, which happened on Saturday in a village, about 530 km from state capital Bengaluru, showed the man pinned to the ground and with his clothes stripped for allegedly touching the bike of a man belonging to an upper caste, after which the physically-assaulted man filed a complaint at a nearby police station. However, a counter case has been filed on Monday stating the dalit man had taken off his clothes and made obscene gestures to two girls in the locality while they were washing clothes. Hailing from the Minaji village, the dalit man filed an case on Saturday in Taikote against the upper caste man including twelve others for mercilessly beating him up after he touched a bike accidentally. The case has been registered under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and sections 143,147, 324, 354, 504, 506, 149 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). According to reports, a counter case under section 354 of the IPC has also been filed on the dalit man. It is said an investigation team had been sent to the site of the incident and had gotten to know today that the man was beaten up when he removed his clothes and showed his private parts to two girls who were washing clothes. The video clip, which has gone viral on social media, has drawn angry reactions for the levels of physical violence that have been exhibited. Furthermore, men are seen standing close to each other and delivering extreme physical blows to the man. In the video, men are also seen not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms, which have been enforced to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

NDTV reported Savitri Devi as saying that she and Ahirwar were Rs. 3 lakh in debt and that they didnтАЩt know whose land it was. She said, тАЬWe've been farming on it for a long time. When our standing crop was destroyed, we didn't have other option, but to kill ourselves.тАЭ The Quint reported IG Gwalior Range Raja Babu Singh as saying that the real squatter on the land was a person named Dabbu Pardhi who allegedly had many criminal cases against him and that he had sublet the land to the Ahirwars for tilling. Action by police and government While the police was let go scot free, an FIR was registered against the couple and they were booked under Section 353 of the IPC (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty, Section 309 of the IPC (Attempt to suicide) among other charges, The Quint reported. The publication also reported that IG Raja Babu Singh also alleged that the video had been clipped and shared as the police wielding lathis, but the police was only trying to shoo away the people who were resisting the cops from taking the farmer couple to the hospital.

The incident took place at Sitanagaram police station in East Godavari district where policemen shaved the head of a Dalit named Vara Prasad, cut his mustache, and allegedly beat him fiercely. After an uproar over the incident, a sub-inspector and a constable have been suspended, while investigation has been started by registering an FIR in the SC-ST Act. According to the victim Vara Prasad, there was a death in his locality on Sunday and preparations for the funeral were going on. Then a truck loaded with sand was passing from there which was stopped due to the last rites. Soon former sarpanch Krishna Murthy arrived in his car and the matter turned into a quarrel. According to Prasad, the matter was over there only but the next day a sub-inspector and a constable took them to the police station in the name of investigation. During this time the Sub Inspector allegedly hit him with a belt. After this, a barber was called who shaved PrasadтАЩs head and mustache. In this case, there was an uproar, and the accused sub-inspector and constable were suspended. DIG of Illuru Range, KV Mohan Rao said that strict action will be taken against the accused policemen so that such incidents do not happen again. DGP Gautam Sawang has also condemned this incident. Opposition parties like Congress, CPI, TDP have attacked the Jagan Mohan Reddy government over police brutality. Former CM Chandrababu Naidu tweeted that тАШJunglerajтАЩ has returned in Andhra Pradesh. People who shaved the head of Vara Prasad are associated with Congress. He alleged that the Dalit youth had raised his voice against illegal sand mining. Policemen have become a toy in the hands of the corrupt ruling party. Jungle Raj has returned to AP.

A lower-caste Dalit couple in India attempted suicide after police beat them and destroyed their crops, causing outrage over the latest case of police brutality against marginalised sections of society. An online video showing half a dozen police officers dragging and beating the couple with sticks to evict them from government-owned land in central Madhya Pradesh state has been viewed more than one million times since it was posted on Tuesday. Videos and photos shared on social media showed police assaulting the couple тАУ Ram Kumar Ahirwar, 38, and Savitri Devi, 35 тАУ along with their children, who were seen sobbing as their parents fell unconscious. тАЬтАж When our standing crop has been destroyed, we donтАЩt have other option, but to kill ourselves,тАЭ Devi was quoted as saying by the ndtv.com news website. The couple consumed pesticide moments after the eviction and were rushed to hospital, S Vishwanath, head of the local administration, told a news conference late on Wednesday, hours before he and the police chief were removed from their posts. 1/ These policemen must get the same treatment from the people, watch that lady!

But the police have registered a case against them for trying to obstruct public servants from the discharge of their duty. тАЬTo force a couple to attempt suicide by damaging their crops тАж is most cruel and shameful,тАЭ Kumari Mayawati, a Dalit political leader, said on Twitter. тАЬNationwide condemnation of the incident is natural. Government should take strict action.тАЭ Government and senior police officials were not immediately available for comment. The eviction was part of a drive to stop encroachment on land and the area the couple was farming had been allotted for the construction of a college, a policeman told Reuters. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. They were begging the police to not destroy their crops as they were in debt ... but the police did not listen to them. N Kumar, a neighbour of the couple, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation Six police officers were suspended on Thursday and the state government has ordered an investigation into the incident. The main opposition party in the state, the Congress, blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the police brutality. тАЬ[Chief Minister] Shivraj Singh ChouhanтАЩs shameless display of arrogance,тАЭ the party tweeted. тАЬHis police force brutally beat up a farmer couple and tore the womanтАЩs clothes. The children are screaming. The end of this blind, deaf and dumb government is near.тАЭ Former chief minister of the state, Kamal Nath, also condemned the тАЬmercilessтАЭ beating of the Dalit couple. тАЬWhat kind of jungle raj [rule] is this?тАЭ he tweeted. The case comes weeks after a father-son duo died in police custody in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. At least five policemen have been arrested over the deaths that caused a public outcry. India banned discrimination based on caste тАУ a system which divided Hindus into groups based on occupations тАУ in 1955. But centuries-old biases against lower-caste groups persist, making it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes.       A growing population and rising pressure on land to build homes, highways and industry is triggering conflicts, with lower-caste citizens often facing eviction, particularly in rural areas where biases are most entrenched, campaigners say. More than half of IndiaтАЩs lower-caste population is landless, according to census data. Several states have laws aimed at giving land to Dalits but few have produced results, according to Dalit activists and leaders. тАЬThey were begging the police to not destroy their crops as they were in debt тАж but the police did not listen to them,тАЭ N Kumar, a neighbour of the couple, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Nankhedi village. He said the couple had asked the police to wait for two months so that they could harvest their crops. Ram Prakash Sharma, a tribal and DalitsтАЩ rights activist in Madhya Pradesh, described the incident as тАЬunfortunateтАЭ and urged authorities to do more to help the couple. тАЬThe Dalits in Madhya Pradesh are one of the most backward people and they do not own farming land,тАЭ he told Reuters. тАЬThe government must provide this couple a house and employment so that they can feed their kids and not die of starvation.тАЭ Follow Al Jazeera English:","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

Senior police officer Anupam Aggarwal said: тАЬAn atrocity case was reported in Talikote on Saturday about an assault on the Dalit man from Minaji village. It was alleged that when he accidentally touched the bike of a man who belonged to the upper caste that he and his family members were assaulted by some 13 men.тАЭ He added that the men were booked under the SC/ST Act and IPC sections 143,147, 149, 324, 354, 504, and 506. However, when the police reached the village to carry out their investigation, they were told that the Dalit man was beaten up because he had taken off his clothes and flashed his genitals at two women who were washing clothes in the vicinity.

In the quarries surveyed in Rajasthan, it was found that over 60% of the workers were Adivasis or Dalits. The study identified key concerns in the quarries including a lack of contracts for most workers who were paid on a piece-rate basis and below minimum wage, especially female workers. Health and safety of the workers was also found to be extremely compromised by the lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with 72% of the workers interviewed reporting that they are not provided any PPE by the quarry management. This puts the workers at a high risk of the lung disease Silicosis, for which there is no cure. Other safety concerns stated in the report include explosions, moving and falling stones, dust, and backbreaking labour. In 60% of the sample quarries visited clean drinking water is lacking and except for a few big quarries, there are no toilet facilities for the workers; they use the open area in and around the quarry, which is an unacceptable situation, especially for women. Debt bondage was also identified in the study as an area of concern, with many workers having to take advances or loans in order to survive, which they then have to work to pay back. Most of the workers do not have contracts and advances and loans are also often not in writing. Nearly 40% of the workers in the study were found to be illiterate тАУ making it very difficult for them to keep control of when their advances and debts have been repaid. Interest on loans was found to range from 24% to 36% per year. On a more positive note, the study finds that progress has been made in reducing child labour in the industry, especially in quarries. Children were however still found to be working in home-based stonework. IDSN welcomes the study and urges companies to address the issues identified urgently, including looking at the marginalisation of Dalits and Adivasis as a key contributor to their exploitation in the sector. The study gives a number of key recommendations to companies. Arisa has approached 112 identified global companies sourcing stone from Rajasthan to initiate a dialogue process with them. The full list of recommendations can be found at the end of the report, and below are the recommendations specific to caste: Caste-related recommendations from the study:   International Dalit Solidarity Network Farvergade 27D, 1.floor DK-1463 Copenhagen K Denmark Tel: +45 31 49 31 04 E-mail: info@idsn.org The International Dalit Solidarity Network (IDSN) works on a global level for the elimination of caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

"480",4521,"https://www.newsclick.in/dalit-women-and-witches","Dalit Women and the ├втВм┼УWitches├втВм┬Э | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS The nose of a Dalit woman тАФ Janaki Bai тАФ was chopped off on August 17 at Raza village in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Janaki and her husband were attacked because she refused to spray pesticides in the agricultural fields of a landlord, Narendra Singh. This is hardly a stray incident of violence on Dalit women. One of the most common weapons wielded by dominant forces in villages to persecute a Dalit woman is to brand her a тАЬdaayanтАЭ (witch). On August 2, a 62-year-old Dalit woman named Maan Devi was killed in Dauki near Agra in Uttar Pradesh over rumours of her being a тАШwitchтАЩ, who was responsible for the mysterious chopping off of womenтАЩs hair. Her son said Maan had gone to answer natureтАЩs call in the fields тАФ a common practice in villages. While she was returning, the villagers attacked her saying she was the witch. The son pleaded with the villagers, but they did not listen. On August 3, a 40-year-old Dalit woman named Kanya Devi was brutally killed on the pretext of being a witch in Ajmer district of Rajasthan. Her husband had died, and her relatives connived with the members of the village panchayat to grab her property. She was dragged from her house along with her 15-year-old son. She was made to eat human excreta. After that she was made to walk on embers and then blinded. On July 20, a 65-year-old Dalit woman named Dhankunwar Bai at Hussainpur village in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh was killed after she confronted some men bullying her son. It turns out that such reports of violence against Dalits and Dalit women are an hourly affair. According to National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, every hour two Dalits are assaulted, while every day three Dalit women are raped, two Dalits are murdered, and two Dalit homes are torched. Reported cases of Murders in the name of Witchcraft  Tara Ahluwalia, a Bhilwara-based activist working for womenтАЩs rights in Rajasthan, says that in 33 years of her work in Bhilwara, she has come across nearly 86 cases of women being branded as тАЬdaayanтАЭ (witch). тАЬMore than 80% of these women belong to the Dalit community. They are usually widows who have no sons or they live in far-off places,тАЭ says Tara. She says this crime is perpetrated mostly by the тАЬprabhavshaaliтАЭ тАУ dominant тАУ persons of the village. The women branded as witches are either killed or are brutally tortured and ostracised from the village. Tara says this can happen within families as well in order to grab the land that widows own. The activist adds that she is yet to come across a single case of тАЬa Brahmin or a Mahajan womanтАЭ who was branded a тАЬdaayanтАЭ. On April 24, 2015, the Rajasthan Prevention of Witch Hunting Act came into force. Till September 30, 2016, the total cases registered under the Act were 50, as revealed by an RTI query.

The Investigation for the same will be submitted in 30 days. Let us know! ЁЯСВWhat type of content would you like to see from us this year? Earlier, the Madhya Pradesh government removed Guna District Magistrate S. Vishwanathan and Superintendent of Police Tarun Nayak in the case of a Dalit couple consuming poison after being beaten up by the police personnel who allegedly tried to remove them from a piece of land. A few days ago, the team which went to remove encroachment on a college land in Cantt police station area of Guna district beat up the Dalit farmer family, after which the farmer couple consumed insecticide. A video of the incident went viral on social media. In the video, some police personnel could be seen beating a Dalit man and his family members. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has taken the matter very seriously and on Wednesday late night issued orders to remove District Magistrate S. Vishwanathan and Superintendent of Police Tarun Nayak. Former Chief Minister Kamal Nath has targeted the Shivraj government over the incident. Nath tweeted on Wednesday, ""Where is Shivraj government taking the state to? What is this jungle raj? Barbaric lathicharge by policemen of Cantt police station area in Guna."" Nath also attached the video of the incident. He further said, ""Even if there is a dispute regarding the land, it can be resolved legally, but in this way taking the law in hand, beating him, his wife, family and innocent children so ruthlessly, where is the justice? Is it because he belongs to a Dalit family, and is a poor farmer?"" Earlier, Home Minister Narottam Mishra ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident. BJP Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia has also called the incident unfortunate and spoke to Shivraj Singh Chouhan and called for strong action against the insensitive officers. Meanwhile, collector Vishwanathan said that the land was reserved for a college building and was illegally occupied by local land mafia Gabbu Pardi who gave it to Rajkumar Ahirwar on a share basis. He said Pardi used the Ahirwar family to encroach upon the land. He also said the condition of the Dalit couple is stable and they are recovering in the hospital.

Follow @ambazaarmag The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Cisco Systems Inc on Tuesday after an Indian American employee accused the tech giant of discrimination, claiming he was harassed by two managers for being from a lower Indian caste than them, according to a report. While the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in San Jose, does not name the alleged victim, the two former Cisco engineering managers, Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella, are labeled as defendants, the Reuters reported.

Editor: Dr. G.G. Parikh | Associate Editor: Neeraj Jain | Managing Editor: Guddi Register to get Janata Weekly into your mailbox and whatsapp! Deepak Malghan Last week, Princeton University announced that it was dropping Woodrow WilsonтАЩs name from its school of public and international affairs. As a тАЬWilson schoolтАЭ alum, I say тАЬAmen!тАЭ It was about time. As late as 2015, when university students had occupied the presidentтАЩs office demanding that the university drop WilsonтАЩs name, the response had been tepid and predictable тАУ a review committee was constituted, and it concluded that WilsonтАЩs contributions to the university outweighed his racism that was тАЬsignificant and consequential even by the standards of his own time.тАЭ The killing of George Floyd, an African American man by Derek Chauvin, a white policeman, constitutes the lived reality of black men in the US. This time, however, FloydтАЩs murder catalysed a worldwide protest movement that has forced institutions like Princeton to take stock of how they are direct beneficiaries of AmericaтАЩs founding sin. There can be no Princeton or Yale without slavery. Dropping WilsonтАЩs name from my alma mater at best amounts to nothing more than scratching the surface. Princeton, like every other elite institution in the US, is a palimpsest made up of sedimented histories of empires, conquests, appropriation, dispossession and segregation. We still await a fuller reckoning with a тАЬpeopleтАЩs historyтАЭ of Princeton and its peer institutions. PrincetonтАЩs decision to finally sever ties with Wilson is perhaps only symbolic. However, the action reminded me of how elite Indian public institutions mirror those in Apartheid South Africa and make Princeton look like a mecca of racial justice. Even as students at Princeton (and elsewhere) force a debate around diversifying faculty and student bodies, elite Indian institutions continue to be in a state of studied denial. About 90% of faculty members at Indian Institutes of Management, where I work, are drawn from less than 10% of IndiaтАЩs social groups. Brahmanical supremacy is at least as insidious as white supremacy. Any Dalit or Adivasi student will attest to how stifling elite Indian campuses can be. Not only do they not have any role models on the faculty body (my institute has just one Dalit faculty member out of over hundred, and not a single Adivasi or Muslim), the nearly monochromatic faculty composition also helps reinforce the widespread Brahmanical notion of historically marginalised students as undeserving interlopers on campus. тАЬUpperтАЭ caste faculty bodies at elite Indian institutions delude themselves into believing that caste is an archaeological relic at odds with contemporary social organisation. In reality, these campuses are sites where the ancien r├йgime institutions of ritual exclusion fuse seamlessly with more secular structures of exclusion. I should know. I have been served a тАЬdisciplinary censureтАЭ for calling out the annual janeu (тАЬsacredтАЭ thread) replacement ceremony for what it is тАУ a casteist and patriarchal performative ritual that is an exhibition of dvija domination. Beyond the official censure, I have also had to take a тАЬvoluntaryтАЭ sabbatical from what has been the most cherished part of my academic life тАУ working with creative graduate students on their dissertation projects. It would be foolhardy to have my students be potentially ejected from the faculty job market in India that is but a Brahmanical guild network in disguise. Despite these significant setbacks, I got away relatively unscathed. Caste is ascriptive; intermittent advocacy or activism is not going to tear away my тАЬupper casteтАЭ shield. A mutinous Brahmin is still a Brahmin тАУ this is precisely how the apparently meritocratic agency of Brahmanical privilege works (and partly explains how the privileged routinely usurp the vanguard in any advocacy for justice). A Dalit faculty member in my position would likely have lost her job. Elite Indian institutions urgently need to examine institutions of Brahmanical privilege masquerading as meritocracy. The fount of my own тАЬmeritтАЭ is the generous diversity and affirmative action program at Princeton. I was able to attend Princeton not only because of my accumulated caste privilege secularised in a Nehruvian public sector industrial township, but also because as a brown-skinned applicant, I helped Princeton tick its diversity box. At IIM Bangalore, where I teach, several of my (Brahmin or Kayasth) faculty colleagues have advanced degrees from some of the best universities in the West and share my broad trajectory. Diversity quotas for brown-Brahmins at Princeton is just dessert. Reservation quotas in Indian institutions designed to acknowledge, if not substantively address, millennia of continuous marginalisation, subjugation, and dispossession is, however, a frontal assault on academic тАЬmerit.тАЭ The Black Lives Matter movement has (rightly) precipitated calls for race reparations across university campuses in the US including at Princeton. The тАЬColumbian exchangeтАЭ and the age of European colonialism with all the associated rapacious and violent institutions including slavery must indeed be central topics for any deliberation on reparations. However, the locus of reparations must be conceived at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In India, it would be utterly hypocritical to not recognise the need for caste reparations. The unmitigated suffering of the precariat trapped between the city and the country during the pandemic-induced economic lockdown has made visible the hidden structures of dispossession. The overwhelming majority of the desperate migrant workers who have perished on roads, railway tracks, railway platforms, and even inside running trains are drawn from the bottom of IndiaтАЩs hierarchical caste totem. If the modern US is firmly rooted in the brutalisation and subordination of a minority Black population, тАЬupperтАЭ caste groups that are numerically in a woeful minority in India have for centuries expropriated the sweat and toil of the labouring castes. While caste dispossession in India is often compared with racial dispossession in the US, a more appropriate point of comparison is the relationship between minority Whites and majority Blacks in southern Africa. A distinguishing feature of the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement is the number of young white men and women who have come out on the streets. India, especially since the rise of the Hindu supremacist forces, has seen a spate of Dalit and Muslim lynching besides continuing police brutality that disproportionately targets the most marginalised. Independent India has been built on the back of wholesale Adivasi dispossession. Why then has India not seen upper caste groups come out in support of тАШDalit Lives Matter,тАЩ тАШAdivasi Lives Matter,тАЩ or тАШMuslim Lives Matter?тАЩ This conundrum is a subject matter for not only the тАЬentire political science,тАЭ but also history, sociology, psychology, and much else. Here, I only want to draw attention to the dialectical relationship between Black Lives Matter and тАЬ#BlackInTheIvory.тАЭ To understand why India has not seen a тАЬDalit Lives MatterтАЭ outpouring on the streets, it is instructive to look for the missing тАЬDalitsInTheIvory.тАЭ American universities, despite their structural conservatism, have played an important role in laying bare how white supremacy operates. As my teachers at Princeton taught me, empires are most effectively challenged by men and women who have effectively mastered the тАЬmetropolitan language.тАЭ The history of anti-colonial struggles around the world is testimony to this elementary fact. Gandhi, Ambedkar, Nehru, Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan all studied at some of the finest western institutions. While it is not wholly accurate to characterise the caste structure as an тАЬempire,тАЭ the self-preservation instincts of entrenched privilege is at the heart of exclusionary structures in contemporary Indian universities. AmbedkarтАЩs clarion call, often interpreted as his lifeтАЩs message, was to тАЬeducate, organize, and agitate.тАЭ Any mobilisation around тАЬDalit Lives MatterтАЭ must necessarily forge an organic relationship with тАЬDalitsInTheIvory.тАЭ It is also for this reason that institutions embedded in a (Brahmanical) privilege network will resist all attempts at democratising university spaces. Exclusionary тАЬupperтАЭ caste symbols enjoying institutional imprimatur mirrors the faux defence of Confederate monuments in the American South as symbols of a bucolic тАЬsouthern heritage.тАЭ For the overwhelming majority in India, the janeu is as much a symbol of exclusion and subordination as a statue of Robert Lee is for African Americans. Modern universities as sites of democratic thought are also despised by authoritarian regimes of every stripe. The current ruling dispensation in India is no exception. An authoritarian regimeтАЩs task is made easier in India by a middle class that is defined entirely by its station in a consumptive network. However, a project of exclusionary nationalism on behalf of its core upper caste constituency cannot succeed should the underclass actually тАЬeducate, organize, and agitate.тАЭ Universities represent some of the most fecund sites available for such a fraternal project. The future of India as a constitutional democratic republic hinges on how liberty, equality, and fraternity are forged on its university campuses. Indian institutions, and especially elite technocratic campuses, must urgently begin a тАЬtruth and reconciliationтАЭ process that includes a transparent and honest reckoning with how they have wilfully supported structures of exclusion for decades. However, history also teaches us that universities need prodding and nudging from the outside. An institution like Princeton was until not long ago a hedge fund for the 1% (white) elite that also granted diplomas on the side. What will it take Indian institutions to begin engaging with questions of caste justice like how Princeton has done with race justice? Do we have institutional leaders in India with the moral vision to confront this question that has haunted India through millennia тАУ from Ekalavya through Rohit Vemula? Both Bama and Sukirtharani have consistently written on the rights of women, liberation of the oppressed and the strength of humanity. The University Grants CommissionтАЩs draft history syllabus has dropped books by well-known historians, such as DD Kosambi, R S Sharma, DN Jha and Irfan Habib. The objective seems to be to glorify mythology rather than history, as also deny any Dravidian links to Harappan culture. Though unlike one another in tone and texture, тАШAdaabтАЩ, тАШToba Tek SinghтАЩ and тАШGarm HawaтАЩ have the same point of departure: that religion as the primary marker of identity is as irrational as it is abhorrent.

The fresh resentments have erupted after the death of a Dalit man identified as Yericharla Kiran, who died in the police custody on the night hours of Tuesday in Prakasam district of the state. Kiran was reportedly arrested and taken under the police custody for not wearing a face mask while he was riding his vehicle. According to the reports, Kiran was arrested by the police on July 18 under the grounds of not wearing a mask, which was mandated to follow to curb the COVID-19 spread. He and his friend were riding in a COVID-19 hotspot of Chirala town in Prakasam district without wearing masks and helmet. According to the police, the duo was stopped and constable Rami Reddy had scolded them for violating the guidelines. The police stated that the duo was under the influence of alcohol and developed the altercation with the constable. Later, they were taken under custody by Sub-Inspector (SI) Vijay Kumar. After being taken under custody, Kiran was taken to the Chirala Government Hospital after sustaining a severe head injury. He was then taken to a private hospital in Guntur for further treatments. However, he has died at the hospital on Tuesday while he was under the police custody and his death has stirred massive outrage against what has become the shocking incident of police brutality. According to the police's version, Kiran has jumped out of the moving police vehicle while he was being taken to the police station following which he has got an injury in his head. However, Kiran's family members refuted the assertion of the police and they alleged that he had died due to the head injury that happened due to the police beating. Following the development, Kiran's father has lodged a complaint against Sub-Inspector Vijay Kumar, and based on his complaint, Vijay Kumar has been booked under section 324 of IPC - voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons. The Andhra Pradesh government has launched the probe into the death of the Dalit man. Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Rs 10 lakh will be provided to the family of the deceased as a solatium. According to the reports, the probe would be conducted by the Additional Superintendent of Police. On Wednesday, Chirala had seen an outrage following Kiran's death, leaving the government to deploy more police forces for the security measures. Condemning the incident, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) General Secretary Nara Lokesh said that the police had thrashed Dalit Kumar with the view of receiving appreciation from the ruling party leaders. By stating that the police are attacking the Dalits like goondas, he questioned the prevalence of the law and order in the state.

The mob-violence by Muslim mobs on the streets of Bengaluru led to 60 cops being injured. While one would expect the Congress to stand up for its MLA, the Grand Old Party displayed its sheer lack of spine as it took to name-calling his nephew, Naveen as someone who is associated with the BJP. Crossing all lines of decency and sanity, and displaying their shameless perception of secularism, which is a synonym for тАЬMuslim appeasementтАЭ, the Congress thought it fit to throw its MLA under the bus and leave him to fend for himself. The party also did not dare speak the truth about the violence, as doing so would alienate Muslim voters from its fold. Therefore, Congress did all in its power to downplay the criminality of the Muslim mob, even if that came at the cost of abandoning their Dalit MLA. Liberal media, which serves as the CongressтАЩ mouthpiece on all such occasions, has meanwhile taken to portray Naveen Kumar as the ultimate villain and has also decided to take it upon itself the task of absolving the mob of their fundamentalist crimes. India Today, whose Data Intelligence Unit is reportedly headed by the intelligent Rahul Kanwal, decided to publish a profile of Naveen Kumar, the infamous man who dared speak ill of the Prophet of Islam, even if as a retaliatory comment. The said profile was prepared using тАШdigital forensics on his social media accounts done by India TodayтАЩs Open Source Intelligence TeamтАЩ. The headline of the profile on Naveen reads, тАЬA Sunny Leone fan, a political aspirant: Know more about man allegedly behind post that burnt Bengaluru.тАЭ A recently married self proclaimed fan of Sunny LeoneтАЩs charity work and a wannabe neta, who is P Naveen Kumar, whoтАЩs posts sparked the Bengaluru riots. Our OSINT desk ran some digital forensics on his deleted SM handles to draw up this character profile https://t.co/92qE1Xw4CO тАФ Rahul Kanwal (@rahulkanwal) August 15, 2020  Why does Sunny Leone make it to the storyтАЩs headline, you would ask? Apparently, the man had once shared a birthday wish for Sunny Leone, and that was sufficient material for the тАЬOpen Source Intelligence TeamтАЭ of India Today to judge him as a fan of the former adult-film actor. The profile of Naveen prepared by India Today is nothing short of an endeavour to make the тАШblasphemousтАЩ man look like the devil incarnate. Being a media house sympathetic to left-liberal ethos, while India Today would on any other day praise people who appear to look like тАШsecularтАЩ and тАШpluralistsтАЩ, the Kanwal-led intelligence team thought it fit to make an exception of this man. As such, while Naveen appears to be secular, India Today doesnтАЩt seem to like this trait in the man. Therefore, the media house goes on to label Naveen as a man who has no тАЬrigid political ideologyтАЭ and whose posts тАЬshout communal harmonyтАЭ. In addition to doing their bid at distancing Naveen from the Congress, India Today, led by Rahul KanwalтАЩs new career-low, takes to portray the man as a non-achiever, who was not a тАЬbright studentтАЭ and who was тАЬno stranger to controversyтАЭ. A Deccan Herald report spoke to the same effect, citing тАШsourcesтАЩ as saying that Naveen is a тАШserial offenderтАЩ, who is habituated to passing derogatory comments against the community that reveres the Prophet, while also insulting the revered figure himself. The report makes it a point to make Naveen look like the aggressor who deserves to be punished for his trespasses against Islam as if India is ruled by sharia law and bears resemblance to Pakistan. The report said, тАЬSources revealed that Naveen, nephew of MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy and the second son of his sister, has a history of posting derogatory content triggering hatred. He posted abusive content on August 5 about the Padarayanapura incidentтАЭ. Ravish Kumar, who leaves no opportunity of pinning the blame on Hindus for any crime committed across the country by random people against Muslims thought it fit this time, though, to pass lectures on how the violent mob of Muslims in Bengaluru was, in-fact, a non-religious one. тАЬA rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to do with Hinduism or Islam.тАЭ The boring and unwatched journalist further added, тАЬRioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash violence.тАЭ While a section of Indian media works overtime to absolve the Muslim mob of all wrongdoings, it deems it fit, like the Congress, to throw a Dalit MLA and his nephew under the bus. One wonders what hell would have been broken loose had the mob been consisted of Hindus instead of Muslims. редред Political Enthusiast редредCompulsively Opinionated редред Aspiring Journalist редред риории риирйАри╡ри╛риВ риорй▒рид риЙрй▒риЪрйА редред Your email address will not be published.

Later, the youths were only let off after they paid Rs 60,000 to the goat owner as fine ordered by the village panchayat. The affected youths have been identified as Parmanand Kumar Das and Shankar Kumar Das. Parmanand said that on Monday, some goats had ventured into their land, following which they tried to whisk them away. He added that the goat owners noticed them hitting and dragging out the goats. Later, the owners allegedly killed the goats by slitting their throats, threw the carcasses in the field belonging to the Dalit youths and accused them of killing their animals. The following morning, the owners dragged the youths out of their houses and tied them to a tree. Then, they were thrashed in the village headтАЩs presence by hundreds of people from Yadav community, according to a report by The New Indian Express. Parmanand claimed that the accused were threatening them with death even after the payment of the fine.

The village comprises over 700 families, of which 40 belong to the Scheduled Caste Naik community. тАЬThe two groups were at loggerheads for a long time due to an old rivalry and it snowballed into a major controversy after the girl plucked flowers from the garden of an upper-caste man,тАЭ Tumusinga police station inspector in-charge A K Dungdung said. According to the villagers, the girl belonging to Dalit community had plucked the flowers two months ago. The girl's parents also apologized and begged the village panchayat to pardon them but there no response from upper caste people. Their ordeal ended following the intervention of police and administration, a police officer said. According to ANI, as a punishment the families are barred from taking part in rituals and are not allowed to talk to anybody in the village. In fact, the government ration shops have been told not to give provisions and the teachers from the community are being forced to obtain a transfer, families allege. However, the matter is resolved now. ""Due to plucking of a sunflower, we Dalits were boycotted and a case was registered at Police station. Police had called the two groups to resolve the matter. But they did not obey, so after some days, we complained again. Now the matter has been resolved in front of officials,"" Bijay Kumar Naik, villager and member of Dalit community told ANI. Harmon Mohalik, villager and member of upper caste community said, ""It was a little issue between Dalit community and our community. The matter has been Already solved in front of police and other officials."" Pranabandhu Das, village Sarpanch said that the villagers are living as they used to live earlier. ""It had happened two months back but people turned it into a matter related to communities. Today it was resolved at Police Station in front of officers. Now we are living as we did earlier, as per the discussion between both groups,"" Das said.

Caste system is deeply rooted in the Nepali society and has been in practice since ancient times. The caste system has been divided into pure and impure domains based on the life practices. The Tagadharis (thread wearing people) and Matawalis (liquor drinking people) are placed under pure and Dalits or Acchuts (untouchable) are placed under impure castes. Such social stratification was based on the profession they carried which has no meaning and sense in the twenty first century globalized world but created division back then. There is no system of moving Dalits to higher castes despite practicing good Karmas (work) and acquiring better knowledge. This has given space to people from upper castes to suppress Dalits till the date. Dalits were treated as untouchable and were forced to do the most difficult tasks of the society. They were engaged in tailoring, shoe making and making tools and utensils from metals. The Tagadharis forced Dalits to do hands-on jobs and took hold of minds-on jobs. They also practiced тАЬChhoichhitoтАЭ which means if the Dalits touched Tagadharis, either they had to take bath or take sprinkles of water to be pure. The Tagadharis used to purify utensils by putting fire and water (Aagopani) before using them. They built separate taps and wells for Dalits in some places. Such inhumane and unjust systems were in practice even few decades ago. The change in political system of the governance has brought significant change in the lives of Tagadharis and Matwalis. But the pace of change is very sluggish in DalitsтАЩ life and world. Ills of discrimination The Dalits over the course of history had to face much discrimination and felt ostracized. When a Dalit boy gets married with an upper caste girl and vice versa, the society ostracizes them and puts them in exile. The cross-caste marriage basically an upper caste girl and Dalit boy is still rejected in the society and is taken as socially unacceptable activity. This has led to a gore in many cases. The society is indisposed to accept a Dalit girl as the bride of their family and the community. This is happening since the social hierarchy and stratifications are deeply rooted in the society and are taken as social stigma and taboo. This has created a problem between Tagadaris and the Dalits. This is the main cause of Rukum incident that took place recently. In our society, due to lack of awareness people believe no matter what they have to maintain social status then that leads to the incident in Rukum. The paradox is this incident took place at the fertile land of Maoist movement which got extensive support of Dalit communities and the movement got momentum since it was targeted for social injustice, abuse and violence. Though there has been significant progress in giving names with dignity and acceptance to Dalits, the society used to give very humiliating names such as Bale, Dume, Chame, Patareetc for males and similar degrading names for females as well. People in the rural areas practice тАЬChhoichhitoтАЭ and тАЬAagopaniтАЭ even in the 21st century. These practices are progressively vanishing and the acceptance in the society is gradually increasing due to political and social movements. This is definitely a good sign for building harmonious society. Although abuse, discrimination and violence based on race, color and caste exist all over the world, the degrees of abuse, discrimination and violence vary. It has been declined in the first world countries but the rate of decline is at snailтАЩs pace in developed and underdeveloped countries. The Rukum incident got attention of the people and humanitarian organizations and started the movement called тАЬDalit Lives matterтАЭ. Those who started this movement were encouraged by the тАЬBlack Lives MatterтАЭ movement of the United States. Both the incidents happened at the same time and тАЬBlack Lives MatterтАЭ movement took momentum in the United States despite COVID-19 pandemic. Though the root cause of violence is different between these movements, they have common purpose of eradicating any forms of abuse, discrimination and violence based on race, color and caste. The society is united in the developed country to fight against color and racial discrimination. It is usually divided in the underdeveloped countries. Steven Pinker in his book Better Angles of Our Nature has described the reason of declining violence in the world. After the Second World War rights movements gradually took momentum. WomenтАЩs rights, child right, rights of color and indigenous people got space in print media and forced governments to formulate policies to address those issues. This also took new heights because of the print media and many books and articles were published to directly hit the ground at the time. These efforts made people realize how important it was to abolish race, caste and color based prejudices. Till the 1950s, many Dalits were not allowed to even attend schools whereas in 1990s the number of Dalit children that attend schools has increased. Much to change Because of rights movement, the discrimination and violence against minorities has been going down since these movements started in late fifties. As Dr Martin Luther king Jr said тАЬthe arc of moral universe is long but it bends towards justiceтАЭ, these movements compelled governments to initiate meaningful policies for social justice and to abolish inhuman practices. Educational revolution has also played a vital role in understanding this notion and push communities towards justice for underprivileged people and communities. The situation of our country is different. Because of dogmatic thought and people bound by religion, it is taking time to bring change in the society. Had Rukum incident happened in Kathmandu, the people would have taken this seriously and there would have been big shift in fighting for the victims. The role of education and the exposure to foreign practices help people accept or reject the happenings of the society. тАЬDalit Lives MattersтАЭ movement needs to be strengthened and meaningful steps need to be taken to permanently abolish caste based injustice, abuses and discriminations from the nation. If this remains in any form in the society, the abuse, discrimination and violence raise its head anytime. DalitsтАЩ representation in decision making bodies and in public institutions need to be increased and space should be given wholeheartedly. This should be a matter of shame and not a matter of ignorance in the 21st century world. The National Code of Nepal (MulukiAin) was enacted in 1963 to maintain peace and foster good relations among people irrespective of class and caste and gender. Many high level committees were formed in the past to abolish caste-based discrimination. The article 255 of the Constitution of Nepal (2015) has a provision of the formation of тАЬNational Dalit CommissionтАЭ as the Constitutional Commissions and this commission has been formed as per the constitution. Though these steps from the stateтАЩs side is positive to address the Dalit issue, no Act, Committee and Commission has reached out to the community and hit the ground to bring change. We also have to understand the contribution made by the Dalits for building this nation and their contribution needs to be sincerely acknowledged by the state and the people. Political parties have to genuinely work on this issue and not to own this issue to reach to power. Schools and schoolteachers have to teach caste tolerance through activities and projects so that young children accept differences from the very young age. There has been a significant change in Dalit communitiesтАЩ economic lives. The number of Dalit children attending school has increased. The number of Dalits working in the governmental sector of our country has also increased. The state has to do a lot to change the attitude of the society to accept the Dalit community in life and world. We do not know how many Nabarajs have to sacrifice their lives in the name of caste if the state fails to come up with the constructive and meaningful strategies to address such issues. We do not know how many springs it would take us to internalize what our great poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota said in his great epic Muna-Madan: тАЬPeople are great by the heart and work rather than the caste they were born into and belong to.тАЭ  It was reported on May 31, 2018 that Bikash Karkidholi, eight years old, was not admitted in Shree Krishna Dwarpayan...

With a heavy deployment of policemen, Lallu along with Rajya Sabha MP P L Punia and others were prevented from emerging from the Azamgarh Circuit House to proceed to the Basgaon village and were detained there itself, said Congress leaders. UPCC chief Lallu alleged that the gates of the Circuit House were locked and policemen were deployed in large numbers to stop the Congress leaders from visiting the Dalit leaderтАЩs village. He launched a scathing attack on the government saying it has adopted an autocratic attitude by preventing people's representatives from visiting the bereaved family. тАЬThe government is out to stop us from visiting the village. Had the number of policemen deployed here were used against criminals, the state would have been free of crime,тАЭ said Lallu. He added that he would visit the bereaved family irrespective of the consequences. Rajya Sabha member Punia too lashed at the government saying that it was wrong to stop people representative from meeting the people. тАЬI will raise this matter in the Parliament,тАЭ Punia said. Interestingly many Congress leaders, seeking to visit the slain Dalit leaderтАЩs village, wore blue scarves, a colour representing the Bahujan Samaj Party. Though Congressmen remained tight-lipped over the choice of the colour of their scarves, UPCC media convenor Lalan Kumar asserted that тАЬno party has the copyright over any colourтАЭ. ""No party has copyright over any colour. Lalluji wore green mask. Has anyone any objection to it?тАЭ he asked тАЬIf Mayawati has any objection, let her issue a statement. She has not even visited the Dalit leaderтАЩs family so far. She is merely acting as a BJP spokesperson and assisting the saffron in the oppression of Dalits. In fact, it has always been the Congress which had been fighting for Dalits,"" said Lallan Kumar. On Friday , 42-year-old Dalit leader Satyamev Jayate alias Pappu, the village head of Basgaon in Tarwan area of Azamgarh district, was shot dead by some miscreants, triggering violence in the area.

Pariyerum Perumal provides us the courage to emerge from this fear. Historically, Indian cinema exploited the labour of Dalits in its making, whilst erasing or appropriating their stories. This was not an accidental practice. When their stories were told on screen, it would be by savarnas who also played their characters with patriarchal, sexist and casteist undertones. The scenario has slowly changed, and the identity of Dalit characters in cinema тАФ directed by a Dalit (and a few non-Dalit) filmmakers тАФ has become explicit, transcending boundaries of caste and class. These filmmakers have helped shape visual storytelling that combines тАЬjustice with aestheticsтАЭ. тАЬJustice with aestheticsтАЭ was rarely present in cinema made by savarnas, or it was seldom honest. Dalit-Bahujan filmmakers have filled this gap, while creating a new wave of cinema that is more appealing to a Dalit-Bahujan audience. In this series, we examine 10 Indian films that count not only among the finest cinema the country has produced, but are also intertwined with justice, politics, and aesthetic. *** тАЬLove does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.тАЭ On reading James Baldwin for the first time a few years ago, I realised that in love тАФ at least in inter-caste love тАФ romance is the least widespread element. I understood why Baldwin, as a Black man, was saying what he was. The idea of тАЬlove as battle and warтАЭ has been romantically injected into the minds of caste-Indians by mainstream Bollywood cinema; most times, with a very poor understanding of what love means in the caste-society of which these movies are part and parcel. Baldwin sees love as a way of shedding the social, cultural and psychological prejudices we uphold, against a person we are in love with. Pariyerum Perumal (2018) directed by Mari Selvaraj, is a cult movie in this sense. It is not only a symbol of resistance against caste; it is more profound that this: it is a symbol of mature love. Because love is the greatest and the only meaningful resistance in caste society. Coming out of our caste-mentality is a freedom, but most of us fear this freedom, especially those who benefit by it. Pariyerum Perumal provides us the courage to emerge from this fear. *** Pariyerum Perumal aka Pariyan (played by Kathir) is a Dalit living in a village тАФ a segregated settlement тАФ near Tirunelveli. HeтАЩs clever and works hard at his studies. He knows his world. As the movie begins, we witness him with his pet dog Karuppi. Karuppi is PariyanтАЩs constant companion. Imagine the world of a Dalit man, in which rejection and humiliation are common, where he is despised by his fellow humans in a caste-society. But animals do not discriminate. So it is not difficult to understand just what Karuppi means to Pariyan. Still from Pariyerum Perumal In a heinous assault, some upper cast hooligans tie Karuppi to the railway tracks where he is crushed by an oncoming train. Pariyan somehow overcomes his grief over KaruppiтАЩs loss and makes his way into law college, a place that represents his dreams, to be like Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Here, he faces difficulties in understanding the teachersтАЩ instructions, imparted in English. English тАФ in the life of a brilliant Dalit student тАФ becomes more than a language. It becomes a cultural tool by which those from dominant castes mock him. Several of his classmates do not understand English, yet Pariyan is the only one mocked and hated by his teachers for flagging the issue. *** PariyanтАЩs honesty catches the attention of Jothi Mahalakshmi or Jo (played by Anandhi) who belongs to the dominant feudal caste. Pariyan tells Jo his problem, and she offers to help. As they English, they talk, laugh, share moments and stories from the past, and it leads to a feeling of love within them. It is as organic as the earth begetting trees, or bees being attracted to flowers. When Jo invites only Pariyan to her sisterтАЩs wedding, her father becomes suspicious. He makes inquiries about Pariyan and finds out he is a Dalit. At the wedding, JoтАЩs father sends her away from the venue on some pretext and corners he just-arrived Pariyan. тАЬYou both study together, does that make you equal?тАЭ he asks Pariyan. The Constitution of India made Jo and Pariyan equal, as human beings capable of loving whoever they want. But JoтАЩs feudal, dominant caste father refuses to uphold constitutional values. For him, caste-norms are everything. He has Pariyan beaten up by some thugs and relatives; they urinate on him. Pariyan is in shock. The incident leaves Pariyan in a dilemma. He tries to use alcohol to get over it, but it doesnтАЩt help. He cannot tell Jo what has happened because that would make her father a villain in her eyes. At the same time, Pariyan is dealing with an issue concerning his own father, who works as a drag queen. When his father visits his college and is humiliated and partly disrobed by the upper caste students, PariyanтАЩs feelings are deeply wounded. But Jo stands by him through it all. *** Jo is like a flower in PariyanтАЩs difficult life. But her father hires a henchman to kill Pariyan, who fails to carry out the murder. Pariyan is also attacked by JoтАЩs relatives and her father. He fights back, but spares JoтАЩs father, telling the older man that if Jo were to know about his violent intentions and actions, she would never forgive him. Even at the height of his righteous rage, Pariyan does not lose hope and behaves like a visionary. He displays a maturity and sensibility heroes in Indian cinema rarely possess. Perhaps he knows that for the society Dr Ambedkar envisioned, it is necessary to kill caste, not castiests. JoтАЩs father meets Pariyan in college. They sit in the canteen, while Jo brings white tea (with milk) for her father and black tea for Pariyan. They drink tea together. JoтАЩs father tells him, тАЬWe can see [about the future]. We do not know what will happenтАЭ, to which Pariyan replies, тАЬAs long as you remain the same and expect me to remain a dog, nothing will changeтАЭ. Jo, her father, and Pariyan begin to walk away. The frame focuses on the empty cups of white and black tea: the beginning of a dialogue towards the annihilation of caste. *** The movie ends with hope, directing us to a possible bloodless revolution тАФ the dream of Dr Ambedkar. While audiences across India, numbering in the millions, pay money to watch movies which provide them an escape from the truth, Pariyerum Perumal introduces us to the beauty of truth тАФ and the necessity of an anti-caste way of life. * Yogesh Maitreya is a poet, translator and founder of Panther's Paw Publication, an anti-caste publishing house.

"501",4714,"https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/medical-negligence-claims-life-of-dalit-scholar-in-telangana-police-refuses-to-take-cognisance","Medical negligence claims life of Dalit scholar in Telangana; police refuses to take cognisance","Follow Us Students of University of Hyderabad have been demanding a probe and the registration of a medical negligence case against Citizens Speciality Hospital in Hyderabad for the death of Dalit scholar Surya Pratap Bharati. However, the Chandanagar police station has so far refused the register a FIR. Bharati is a first generation scholar from a scheduled caste community in Uttar Pradesh. On August 17, 30-year-old Bharati suffered from an acute ischemic stroke and was rushed to Citizens Speciality Hospital based on reference by the UniversityтАЩs health centre. Ischemic stroke is the most common stroke and it occurs when an artery to the brain is blocked. As the brain depends on arteries to bring fresh blood from the heart and lungs, when arteries become blocked there can be serious brain damage. тАЬWhen we took him to the hospital, he retained mild cognitive abilities. He could speak, recognise people and retained some of his motor functions even though the left side of this body became paralysed,тАЭ said Faizan, a HCU student and BharatiтАЩs friend. On reaching the hospital, they were informed that Surya would require a surgery immediately after running the diagnosis and required tests. тАЬAs requested by the hospital, we made all the arrangements,тАЭ said Ramesh, another student who had gone to the hospital. (Name has been changed to protect identity) Citizens Hospital tested Bharati for COVID-19 using the Rapid Antigen Test and he tested negative. тАЬHowever, the hospital refused to conduct the surgery without conducting the RT-PCR test. So, for 24 hours, Surya was kept in an isolation ward and we were not informed about his condition,тАЭ insisted Faizan. The next day, on August 18, a RT-PCR test was conducted and the result came positive on August 19. Citizens Hospital then denied him treatment based on this test result. They said that he had to be moved to another hospital. All the students of HCU are a part of an insurance scheme, which gives them coverage of up to тВ╣1.5 lakh. Being HCU, they are also given a 40% reduction in the total bill amount. Initially, the hospital gave them a bill of тВ╣86,000, of which the students only had to pay тВ╣57,000. However, the hospital refused to acknowledge Surya as a student of the University. This is despite his friends showing the hospital his ID card and other details. As a result, the hospital demanded full payment and refused to acknowledge the UniversityтАЩs insurance scheme as well. тАЬAs we were attempting to reduce the bill amount, a friend of ours slipped into the ward, only to find Surya unmonitored and convulsing,тАЭ explained Ramesh. His friends then immediately informed the doctors, who put him on ventilator support. In the ensuing two hours that he was on a ventilator, the hospital increased the bill to тВ╣1.57 lakh. If he had been considered a student, he would have had to pay тВ╣1.12 lakh. After a lot of arguments with the students, the Citizens Hospital agreed to let Surya be transferred to another hospital on the payment of тВ╣1.12 lakh. тАЬWe lost precious time at Citizens Hospital. He was kept there for almost 48 hours. There is a golden hour for stroke patients, and he had definitely crossed that,тАЭ said Faizan. Surya was then transferred to Continental Hospital at Nanakramguda. тАЬWhen we arrived here, the doctors informed us that there were only slim chances for SuryaтАЩs survival. As we were sure of the RT-PCR Covid Test done by Citizen Hospital, we requested Continental Hospital not to conduct the test,тАЭ added Faizan. While he was at Continental Hospital, Surya developed edema and multiple organ failures. Edema is a condition causing swelling of your body as a result of fluid in your body's tissues. At 9.30 am on August 20, Surya was declared brain dead and he died on August 21. However, the RT-PCR tests conducted at Continental Hospital was negative. A third RT-PCR test was done to re-affirm the COVID-19 negative result. It also came back as negative. тАЬTo confirm that there was no doubt, we requested the hospital to do an antibody test, in which it was found that he had no reactive antibodies in his blood. This means that he hadnтАЩt contracted the virus,тАЭ added Faizan. HCUтАЩs Chief Medical Officer Dr Anupama Rao said Surya was found unconscious in the hostel. He was brought to the medical room for examination and then immediately taken to CitizenтАЩs Hospital. тАЬI was in touch with the neuro-physician there. When he reached, the doctors said they have to follow Covid-19 procedures. On the second day, the doctor seemed positive about his condition. We did hear about the insurance issues. We tried to help. I canтАЩt comment on any other aspect of the case,тАЭ underscored Rao. тАЬWe have been running around to register the FIR. We have gone at least twice daily to the police station from August 21. Today also, the police sent us back. We ran an online campaign to request mass emails to be sent to the Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile. He was the VC even during the death of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula,тАЭ said Abhishek Nandan, HCU Students Union President. Sub-inspector Ahmad Pasha of Chandanagar police station said they were waiting for a legal opinion in this case. тАЬWe are waiting to see if we can register the FIR. We have asked Citizens Hospital for details regarding the case. A decision on this will be taken tomorrow,тАЭ said Pasha. He did not have an answer when asked about the inordinate delay in registering the FIR. Calls to HCU Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile and administrative staff of Citizens Hospital went unanswered. This article will be updated as and when they respond. This is not the first case of medical negligence related to Dalit scholars at HCU. Ph.D scholar Rohith Vemula had died by suicide on January 17, 2017, after leaving behind a letter talking of unfinished dreams and how he felt his тАЬbirth was his fatal accidentтАЭ. He was targeted by Akhil Bharatatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and his fellowship of Rs 25,000 was suspended for raising тАЬissues under the banner of the Ambedkar Students AssociationтАЭ.

People can be heard speaking in a Rajasthani dialect in the video. We performed a keyword search based on this information and found a Dainik Bhaskar report from July 31, 2020. According to the report, a person was beaten up and tied to a tree on the suspicion of an illicit relationship with a woman in Konar village of Chohtan police station area, тАЛтАЛBarmer district, Rajasthan. The victim hails from the Bhil caste and is a resident of Mogawan Bakhasar. As per the report, he entered a womanтАЩs house in Ratanpura and stayed the night. When locals in the area learned in the morning, they tied the youth to a tree, beat him up, shaved off his hair and forced him to drink urine. The case did not reach the police as the village panchayat helped both parties reach an agreement. But after a video of the incident went viral on social media, Chohtan police took cognisance of the matter and registered a case against the accused. The report quotes Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ajit Singh who said that both sides hail from the Bhil caste.  Jagran also published a report on the incident on July 31. We spoke with Barmer SP Sharma who informed that the case does not depict Dalit oppression but a family issue. The youth who was thrashed belongs to the Bhil community (Scheduled Tribes) and the people who attacked him also hail from the same community. Sharma said that this incident is from Chohtan police station area, Barmer district. He was caught with a woman and subsequently beaten up. His hair was also shaved off. SP Sharma said that no complaint was lodged with the police as this was a family issue. But the cops took cognisance of the matter after a video went viral and filed a case. The names of the accused can be seen in the complaint attached below.  After Barmer police noticed that the video was circulating with false context, they clarified on Twitter that the incident was related to a family dispute. The tweet also stated that six people have been arrested so far. https://t.co/BqqRSWsnrV рдЗрд╕ рд╡реАрдбрд┐рдпреЛ рдореЗрдВ рдЧрд▓рдд рдмрддрд╛рдпрд╛ рд╣реИ рдХрд┐ рдПрдХ рджрд▓рд┐рдд рд╡реНрдпрдХреНрддрд┐ рдХреЛ рд╡рд░реНрдЪрд╕реНрд╡реА рдЬрд╛рддрд┐ рджреНрд╡рд╛рд░рд╛ рдкреНрд░рддрд╛рдбрд╝рд┐рдд рдХрд┐рдпрд╛ рдЧрдпрд╛ред рдЬрдмрдХрд┐ рд╡рд╛рд╕реНрддрд╡рд┐рдХрддрд╛ рдпрд╣ рд╣реИ рдХрд┐ рдпрд╣ рдШрдЯрдирд╛ 5 рджрд┐рди рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рдкрд╛рд░рд┐рд╡рд╛рд░рд┐рдХ рд╡рд┐рд╡рд╛рдж рдХреЛ рд▓реЗрдХрд░ рдШрдЯрд┐рдд рд╣реБрдИ рдереАред рдкреБрд▓рд┐рд╕ рдиреЗ рдкреНрд░рд╕рдВрдЬреНрдЮрд╛рди рд▓реЗрддреЗ рд╣реБрдП рдЕрдкрдиреА рддрд░рдл рд╕реЗ FIR рджрд░реНрдЬ рдХрд░ 6 рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рдХреЛ рдЧрд┐рд░. рдХрд┐рдпрд╛ рд╣реИ тАФ Barmer Police (@Barmer_Police) July 31, 2020 An incident where a youth from the Scheduled Tribes Bhil sub-caste was thrashed by people from his own community was shared on social media with the false claim that a Dalit man was tortured in Rajasthan.

Dalit Atrocities | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Representational image. On May 23, Nawaraj BK, a young man from Jajarkot district in Nepal, was brutally killed along with five friends and thrown in the Bheri river for wanting to marry a girl of his choice. The young woman, Grishma (name changed), from Rukum in Western Nepal, belonged to the dominant тАЬhighтАЭ caste. Despite being from different castes, the couple had been in a relationship for two years. Nawaraj was an athlete and a bright student. He had passed the written exam of Nepal Police and was waiting for the interview. He often used to go to play in Rukum and that is how he met Grishma. She and her younger brother had visited NawarajтАЩs home a few times. In the beginning, NawarajтАЩs parents believed she was their daughterтАЩs friend. But the girl eventually revealed that she was NawarajтАЩs girlfriend. His parents were scared of their growing relationship. NawarajтАЩs father, Mohan Lal Bishwokarma, showed a picture of Grishma and his son to GrishmaтАЩs relative, Indra Bahadur Malla, believing that he would inform her family. But Indra replied with a casteist slur, тАЬOh a тАШDumтАЩ is daydreaming to be a ThankuriтАЩs father-in-lawтАЭ. Although Rukum district is the original stronghold of the former Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which believes in a society free of caste discrimination, Mohan was acutely aware of the consequences of inter-caste marriages. He and his wife pressured Nawaraj to break his relationship, because there would be no future after tying the knot with a dominant caste woman. But the young lovers did not care about caste barriers. According to news reports, on May 23, Grishma asked Nawaraj to bring a group of friends to help them elope, for she was worried that her family and relatives could attack him. Nawaraj came with 18 friends to Rukum. As soon as GrishmaтАЩs mother saw him, she used the same casteist slur and shouted: тАЬтАШDumтАЩ you are here again, arenтАЩt you still afraid of the last beating! Today you wonтАЩt leave alive.тАЭ A crowd of more than 50-60 people killed the six youngsters with stones, sickles, sticks and other weapons, then dumped them in the river. Some of the dead bodies were difficult to recognise due to the deep cuts, broken bones and other serious injuries. Lokendra SunarтАЩs private parts were chopped off, his mother Laxmi Sunar alleged. Violence against dalits often does not end just in death, it also involves mutilation of their bodies. тАЬVillagers didnтАЩt only kill my son Nawaraj but also his friends who stood for his love,тАЭ said Mohan, in a heavy voice. He added, тАЬI saw his bruised dead body in his friendтАЩs clothes with his shoes on although he had many clothes. I wondered why he didnтАЩt wear his [own] clothes?тАЭ Later, Mohan came to know of NawarajтАЩs strategic move to conceal his identity as a groom in order to avoid a possible attack. *** India has also witnessed caste killings in the name of honour for very long. The Kaushalya case tells the same story as Nawaraj and GrishmaтАЩs. KaushalyaтАЩs husband, Shankar, was killed in the name of honour on 13 March 2016. The coupled had lived away from their family at Uddumalaipettai in Tamil Nadu. While Kaushalya was from the dominant Thevar caste, Shankar was a dalit. Her parents had directed goons to attack Shankar in broad daylight, an incident that was caught on CCTV. The role of state, police, and judiciary in KaushalyaтАЩs case also resembles its role in the Nawaraj case. From the policeтАЩs alignment with the dominant Thevars to the delay and insensitivity of the judiciary, the matter was repeatedly mishandled. 22 June 22, the Madras High Court acquitted Chinnasamy, KaushalyaтАЩs father and the prime accused. Kaushalya found the judgment from the High Court quite unsettling. She says, тАЬAs long as I am alive, I will fight for justice. I will live to see justice for Shankar.тАЭ *** Caste plays a significant role in maintaining sexual purity in Hindu society. The rampant violence we witness across South Asia against dalits aims to prevent inter-caste marriages. Sexual violence in particular is inflicted to maintain the тАЬpurityтАЭ of a high-caste womanтАЩs womb. A sexual relationship with a dalit, even the touch of a dalit, is considered defiling. For this reason, dalits have historically been vulnerable to violence; and transgressing caste through inter-caste marriage has unleashed some of the worst forms of violence against Dalit communities. In India, the incidence of inter-caste marriage is as low as 10%, while in Nepal there have only been 244 inter-caste marriages in a decade. In Nepal, 56% of inter-caste couples are displaced and 57% are socially boycotted. About 6% are reportedly attacked for their inter-caste marriage, according to one estimate. NepalтАЩs Feminist Dalit Organisation or FEDO reports that 729 incidents of rape of women of all castes took place during the nine months from April 2019 to January 2020. Some 154 (21%) of these were of dalit women and girls. Of these, only 15% cases ended in a conviction. Furthermore, 731 cases of violence against women were registered in the district police stations of Province No. 7 between January to September 2019, of which 119 (16.2%) involved dalit victims. In India, too, dalit women rarely get justice. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, among states, Bihar reports the highest rate of crime against members of the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). The highest number of crimes against SC communities is recorded in Uttar Pradesh, which also accounts for 25.6% of total reported crimes. The rate at which the police file charge-sheets for violence against SCs and STs is 78.3% and 81.3% respectively. This is lower than the national rate of charge-sheeting violence, which is 87.5%. Out of the total crimes committed against Dalits, rape is reported to be the highest in number. Uttar Pradesh reported 14.5% (49,262 out of 3,38,954 cases) of total crimes against women. What is most distressing about the Rukum case is how loosely the judiciary discussed it. Mothers are desperate, looking for justice for their sons, and pained to see three people, including the alleged conspirator, GrishmaтАЩs mother and the ward chair, being released on bail. Shockingly, a judge asked the dalit prosecutor, Prakash Nepali, during the pleadings: тАЬDoes calling someone тАШDumтАЩ imply caste-based discrimination?тАЭ NawarajтАЩs mother in a later conversation recalled the defence attorney saying, тАЬтАШWhat else would we call a тАШDumтАЩ but a тАШDumтАЩ?тАЩтАЭ Such statements reflect the caste arrogance that persists in NepalтАЩs judicial structure. NepalтАЩs judiciary and other state institutions lack adequate representation of dalits and women. According to Shyam Bhattarai, joint secretary at the Attorney GeneralтАЩs office, of NepalтАЩs 519 public prosecutors, only seven (1.3%) are dalits. In 2017-18, there were 394 judges at the Supreme, High, and District Court levels. In these courts, there were 14 women judges, just 3.5% of the total number of judges. Dalit judges were only 0.5% of all judges. Recently, one dalit judge was appointed in the High Court and a dalit woman in the district court. There are no dalit judges in the Supreme Court. In India, too, the judiciary lacks adequate representation from SC, ST and OBC communities. The way the collegium system works is responsible for this, for it mostly benefits members of elite castes. Out of a total 16,693 judges in the subordinate courts, only 3,973 are SC/ST/OBC. In the Supreme Court, there is one dalit judge out of 31. It is only in 2017 that a dalit judge, Ramkrishna Gavai, found a position in the Supreme Court after nearly a decade. Dalits are estimated to be 13.8% to 20% of the population of Nepal. Roughly one of every sixth Nepali is a dalit, which is similar to the situation in India. IndiaтАЩs SC population is 16.6% of the total population. According to the 2014 Benchmark Study by Samata Foundation, 43.6% of Hill dalits and 38.2% of Terai dalits are below the poverty line. The national average is 25.2%. Dalits have 8% representation in NepalтАЩs Parliament. Currently, there are 26 dalit MPs: 19 in the House of Representatives out of a total 275, and seven (or 11.8%) in the National Assembly. None of the Dalit women are in the National Assembly. There are no directly elected Dalit women MPs either. A scrutiny of recent reports of dalit atrocities begs a pertinent question: to what extent are dalit lives important in South Asia? Does the gap between constitutional rights and lived realities of dalits not reveal the tokenism with which dalit identity is discussed? Stories of atrocities against dalits are limited to news flashes and the occasional Twitter trend. There is a structural denial to resolve the issues that really matter. Dalits are denied emancipation by the failure to recognise caste structures and the violence that is embedded within them. Violence against dalits are most often unleashed when any so-called caste boundary is transgressedтАФas happened to Nawaraj and Kaushalya. This systemic problem prohibits dalits from retaining a human right as basic as marrying a person of their choice. We have to seriously understand how the caste system has created and sustained the deeply-entrenched injustice of our social systems. Only this would address the future of over 250 million dalits, by ensuring all Dalit-Bahujans worldwide can reclaim their human dignity. The prevailing uneasy silence over the violence inflicted against dalits is disturbing. While in and beyond the United States the race question has been taken up even during a harsh pandemic, the caste question is hardly ever addressed. The problem with caste is that it is so enmeshed in everyday social structures in this part of the world that even though it is invisible it keeps on operating. The shared caste consciousness, which allows caste to keep reproducing, needs to be shelved. The hope for an anti-caste discourse lies in developing a true ally-ship. We need to rework the concept of ally-ship so that it means much more than social networking. A true ally-ship needs a new shared language through which different aspects of the caste question can come together. What we need is a тАЬradical empathyтАЭ, something Isabel Wilkerson, the first woman of African-American heritage to win the Pulitzer Prize, has discussed in her recent feature in the New York Times Magazine. Such an ally-shipтАФamong and beyond dalitsтАФwill not only reclaim dalit lives, but restore human dignity. It will ensure that justice for dalits is never again delayed, deferred or denied.

In another instance of caste-based discrimination, a Dalit panchayat president in a village of Tamil Nadu's Tiruvallur district has claimed she was not allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day. V Amurtham, the 60-year-old panchayat chief of Athupakkam village, about 45 km from state capital Chennai, said she was invited to hoist the flag at a government school. However, she was later asked not to come citing Covid-19 concerns. The panchayat chief's son, Sasikumar, said his mother received the call inviting her to the school for flag hoisting at 8:30pm, but was asked half an hour later to not come. He added that the Independence Day event was held without her the next day, despite the apparent health concerns. Amurtham claimed that the former panchayat chief still held sway over community affairs and that she has been at the receiving end of discrimination and threats. ""My mother is wondering if she should give up the responsibility,"" said Sasikumar. Aurtham told reporters that she needs protection as she feels threatened because she belongs to the SC/ST community. This was the second such incident for the panchayat chief. In January, Amurtham was turned away from hoisting the tricolour in the school. When contacted, district authorities said they have not received any formal complaint. Meanwhile, the State Human Rights Commission has sought a report from the district collector.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

Historically, Indian cinema exploited the labour of Dalits in its making, whilst erasing or appropriating their stories. This was not an accidental practice. When their stories were told on screen, it would be by savarnas who also played their characters with patriarchal, sexist and casteist undertones. The scenario has slowly changed, and the identity of Dalit characters in cinema тАФ directed by a Dalit (and a few non-Dalit) filmmakers тАФ has become explicit, transcending boundaries of caste and class. These filmmakers have helped shape visual storytelling that combines тАЬjustice with aestheticsтАЭ. тАЬJustice with aestheticsтАЭ was rarely present in cinema made by savarnas, or it was seldom honest. Dalit-Bahujan filmmakers have filled this gap, while creating a new wave of cinema that is more appealing to a Dalit-Bahujan audience. In this series, we examine 10 Indian films that count not only among the finest cinema the country has produced, but are also intertwined with justice, politics, and aesthetic. *** Udta Punjab тАФ directed by a Brahmin filmmaker, Abhishek Chaubey тАФ released in June 2016 after a much-reported row with the censors. Apart from its censorship woes, the film on its release was lauded for highlighting the epidemic of drug abuse among the youth of Punjab. However, IтАЩd argue that the film in fact sensationalised the subject, failing тАФ precisely due to this reason тАФ in providing the audience with what good cinema must: perspective. That perspective can be found in Chamm, a 2017 Punjabi language film, directed by Rajeev Kumar. Chamm released not in theatres but in screenings among the villagers to whom it belongs, passing from the people of one pind to another. To watch Chamm is to develop a perspective to see human stories from lands far from our own, in languages that are not ours, of people who share a commonality in their joys and sorrows. Chamm also establishes a truth about todayтАЩs Punjab with every frame: that this Punjab is not тАЬgrandтАЭ anymore, it is organically deprived. *** тАЬChammтАЭ translates to skin in Punjabi; the filmтАЩs story is as intrinsic to Punjab as the idea of revolution once was to it. Its protagonist is Keepa Singh, a Dalit who works as a tanner. He skins animals and sells their hides at a factory to make a living. His wife is employed as a housemaid; they live with KeepaтАЩs brother (who doesnтАЩt have a regular job) and his pregnant wife. Keepa and his wife have no children, but they rejoice in the impending addition of a niece or nephew to their family. In his community, Keepa is respected for his honesty. Keepa is Sikh by religion. But by Jat Sikhs, heтАЩs treated as тАЬunworthyтАЭ (an untouchable). His worth is recognised only in the wake of a village election for Sarpanch. A Jat Sikh candidate, hoping to cash in on KeepaтАЩs image within his community, asks for his help in contesting the polls. This candidate, however, loses, and his rival тАФ another Jat Sikh тАФ decides to teach Keepa a lesson by bringing the plot of land on which Keepa carries out his tanning under government control. To continue working there, Keepa has to cough up half a lakh, which he scrapes together somehow, even borrowing money from a friend whose son recently died of a drug overdose. Even as Keep manages the balancing act between work, hunger and survival, a personal tragedy awaits: his sister-in-law, advised by a con baba that she should deliver her baby only at her husbandтАЩs home or risk her childтАЩs life, returns. When it is time for the birth, complications arise that make an at-home delivery impossible, and she is rushed to the hospital. The hospital demands money to admit her, and as KeepaтАЩs family cannot arrange the funds in such a short time, the baby is lost. A sorrowful Keepa and his brother bury the infantтАЩs remains. But KeepaтАЩs tragedies are not due to poverty alone, they are deeply social. KeepaтАЩs grief is historical. Poster for Chamm *** Chamm demands our uninterrupted attention as viewers, to see it as more than a movie or a story. It addresses the two eternal pursuits of a man: hunger and dream/s. But it requires that one think rationally rather than emotionally, because to understand the emotional complexities which lie at the heart of any exploitation, it is necessary to think rationally. In Black Skin White Mask, Franz Fanon observed that, тАЬAll forms of exploitation are alike. They all seek to justify their existence by citing some biblical decree. All forms of exploitations are identical, since they apply to the same тАШobjectтАЩ тАФ man. By considering the structure of suchтАж an exploitation from an abstract point of view, we are closing our eyes to the fundamentally important problem of restoring man to his rightful place.тАЭ Caste is the position of an individual in our society. This position denotes limitations to low/lower castes, and freedom to high/higher castes. This is the subtext of Chamm. Keepa Singh is politically aware but deploys all his energies into his work, his livelihood. He is also stuck in the dilemmas of the past. But politics comes to him. He is a vote, hence he must be identified. Meanwhile, his personhood is crucified. As a director, however, Rajeev Kumar keenly explores the personhood of Keepa Singh. He is shown carrying hides to the factory, breaking [animal] bones and separating them, meditating on his life and misery. His younger brother, struggling to find regular employment, is almost brainwashed by Jat Sikh politicians at the beginning of the film. KeepaтАЩs wifeтАЩs upper caste-class employers accuse her of stealing food, assaulting her dignity. This is an important frame, sharpening our perspective and making it more critical, as this is a story about the тАЬinvisible men (and women)тАЭ in our lives and movies. To keep his work of skinning dead animals, Keepa is pushed into a dire financial situation. This in turn means he does not have the money to save his brotherтАЩs child. It is a metaphorical situation, hard even to imagine. But there are people in this caste-society who go through it. Chamm succinctly addresses this problem; at the same time, it also provides hope. *** His brother eventually moves to the city and a veterinary doctor comes to stay as a paying guest at KeepaтАЩs house. She organises the Dalits in the village. After confrontations with Jat Sikhs, Keepa and his community succeed in buying land and cultivating it. When the doctor leaves the village, the villagers promise to continue their struggle against exploitation, by being organised. This is Chamm тАФ from being deeply personal, it becomes profoundly political. Miseries are pushed into the background, and hope is resurrected. Chamm explains to us the emotional theater of a colonised man, as analysed by Fanon. Chamm demands the necessity of the vision of Ambedkar in the struggle against caste. Chamm ensures we do not forget the possibility of Raidas Saheb/RavidasтАЩ Begumpura: тАЬThe regal realm with the sorrowless name they call it Begumpura city, a place with no pain, no taxes or cares, none owns property there, no wrongdoing, worry, terror, or torture. Oh my brother, IтАЩve come to take it as my own, my distant home, where everything is right тАж They do this or that, they walk where they wish, they stroll through fabled palaces unchallenged. Oh, says Ravidas, a tanner now set free, those who walk beside me are my friends.тАЭ * Yogesh Maitreya is a poet, translator and founder of Panther's Paw Publication, an anti-caste publishing house.

Kaala breaks this monotony. Historically, Indian cinema exploited the labour of Dalits in its making, whilst erasing or appropriating their stories. This was not an accidental practice. When their stories were told on screen, it would be by savarnas who also played their characters with patriarchal, sexist and casteist undertones. The scenario has slowly changed, and the identity of Dalit characters in cinema тАФ directed by a Dalit (and a few non-Dalit) filmmakers тАФ has become explicit, transcending boundaries of caste and class. These filmmakers have helped shape visual storytelling that combines тАЬjustice with aestheticsтАЭ. тАЬJustice with aestheticsтАЭ was rarely present in cinema made by savarnas, or it was seldom honest. Dalit-Bahujan filmmakers have filled this gap, while creating a new wave of cinema that is more appealing to a Dalit-Bahujan audience. In this series, we examine 10 Indian films that count not only among the finest cinema the country has produced, but are also intertwined with justice, politics, and aesthetic. *** We didnтАЩt go to the stage, nor were we called. With a wave of the hand, we were shown our place. There we sat and were congratulated, and тАЬtheyтАЭ, standing on the stage, kept on telling us of our sorrows. Our sorrows remained ours, they never became theirs. When we whispered out doubts they perked their ears to listen, and sighing, tweaking our ears, told us to shut up, apologise; or elseтАж тАФ Verses by Waharu Sonavane; translated from the Marathi *** While Waharu SonavaneтАЩs popular poem summarises the politics of presentation in social movements, it can also apply to the hypocrisy in the story-telling business in India. Indian cinema too has largely operated in the manner this poem conveys. In Bollywood movies, especially, there is a vast gap between the social life of its viewers and the movies they watch. This in turn created a viewer who assumes the role of cinema in their lives is to entertain, rather than educate. These viewers do not watch this cinema in their time of leisure, but to steal some time for leisure. As a result of this peculiar condition, such Bollywood movies became a substance which the masses needed to consume for two-and-a-half hours, to steal time for leisure. The universality of cinema in India has remained largely remained allied with the ideology of oppression. In it, real hunger тАФ educational or intellectual тАФ is essentially replaced by the hunger for entertainment at the cost of demonising the aesthetic and sociality of the masses, that comprise the bulk of its viewers. Pa RanjithтАЩs Kaala (2018) demolishes this vulgarity of Indian cinema. It represents the resurrection of the masses in the world of cinematic stories. Poster for Pa Ranjith's Kaala (2018) Movies in India had long ceased to be based on the shared issues of the masses, and perpetuated the existence of their hunger into the hunger for materiality of art, in this case cinema. This is why Kaala is a breakthrough movie in the lives of the masses as an audience, and in their memories of movie-watching: all of them can relate to it, all of them are in it, all of them have subjectivity in it. Each frame is evidence of this. *** Karikaalan aka Kaala (Rajinikanth) lives in Dharavi, referred to as тАЬthe biggest slum in MumbaiтАЭ by elites. He is a Tamil Dalit, whose father migrated from Tirunelveli to Mumbai decades ago when Dharavi was not Dharavi but just a marshy land sheltering the homeless. Gradually, the area becomes a home for thousands of people, across castes, languages and religions, all of them in the city to secure a livelihood. Dharavi shelters them. Kaala is born here; his lives through many ups and downs, and also witnesses the murder of his father. He goes on to become a godfather of Dharavi, fighting for the rights of his people. He is well aware that people like him must resort to тАЬrowdy-ismтАЭ at times, because often тАШlaw and orderтАЩ fails to protect them, and at times the executioners of law and order harass people like him. Kaala not only expresses the anguish of the masses but also paves the way to transform it into a philosophy of action in their struggle. This is a rare achievement. It puts an end to the alienation between viewers and cinematic stories; both become one. Throughout the movie, icons such as Periyar, Buddha, Dr Ambedkar recur in the frames and in the background. Although this is part of the story and also the storytellerтАЩs intention, their inclusion also suggests the need for democratisation of cinematic frames. While this iconography has existed in public spaces, it has rarely appeared (or been deliberately erased) by savarna filmmakers in their movies. Kaala reclaims the erased anti-caste world. It reifies the aesthetics of тАЬblackтАЭ, the symbol of labour, struggle and strength. *** In Kaala, land is the protagonist. The storyтАЩs villain, Hari Dada (Nana Patekar), is swallowed by it when he attempts to seize it. As the narrative opens, it takes viewers to a time when land was free, then introduces them to a time when land became a matter of rights and power. Dharavi as a place which shelters many people across castes, religions and languages, seems to inherit this history as well as the story of land when it was free and when it started becoming a matter of power and subsequently rights, for the masses. Kaala addresses the problems of people across the world who are struggling to acquire land for their survival, and in whose lives, land is equivalent to their dreams. At the same time, this is a story rooted in the psyche of India, a caste society. By 2018, the political fabric of Indian society had become far too intrusive in the lives of the masses for it to be neglected. тАЬWhiteтАЭ as the symbolic colour of Indian politics took on an oppressive hue; it became a villain. тАШKaalaтАЩ (black) тАФ as a colour, an idea, or symbolic persona тАФ had never been seen as a hero, certainly not in cinema. This aesthetic is turned upside down in Kaala. It is not the case that Indian movies have never dealt with political subjects or politics in their stories, but they lacked aesthetics from the lives of the masses. Kaala breaks this monotony. It reclaims the existence of the common man into the cinematic imagination. * Yogesh Maitreya is a poet, translator and founder of Panther's Paw Publication, an anti-caste publishing house.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, a senior officer of the state government said the scholarships have been put on hold because these are linked to the studentsтАЩ attendance in their respective classes. тАЬAs schools have been closed since March, no scholarships have been disbursed to students. However, we have distributed textbooks,тАЭ added the officer. Haryana Vidyalaya Adhyapak Sangh, a body of government school teachers, on Thursday urged the government to release scholarships and other incentives to eligible students as early as possible. тАЬStudents from poor communities have more need of government incentives during the pandemic because a large number of people have lost their jobs. Not only this, they have to make arrangements for TV or mobile phones to enable themselves to watch the lectures telecast through education channels of Doordarshan,тАЭ said Adhyapak Sangh president C N Bharti. In Haryana, almost 70 per cent government school students belong to underprivileged sections, including Dalits and below poverty line (BPL) families. Upto Class VIII, there are about 8 lakh students, mainly Dalits, from government schools who avail cash incentives under the government schemes. According to officials, almost half of the 52 lakh school students study in government schools in Haryana. Of total 24,000 schools in the state, nearly 14,500 are government schools. тАЬWe give one-time cash incentives to SC students annually sometime after their admissions to the schools so that they can purchase stationary or other related items to pursue their studies. The incentive amount varies for students of different classes, like for students of Class I, it is Rs 980 annually while its Rs 1,250 for class VIII students,тАЭ said an official. Apart from this, there are monthly cash incentives for students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Backward Castes and Below Poverty Line (BPL) which is meant to encourage them to attend classes regularly. тАЬFor classes I to V boys from SCs there is a monthly incentive of Rs 150 and while this amount is Rs 200 for classes VI to VIII students. The SC girls from classes I to V get Rs 225 monthly and Rs 300 for classes VI to VIII. This incentive is almost half to students from Backward Castes and BPL families, if it is compared with SC students,тАЭ said the official. There is a third category which is for meritorious students from all communities. Under this category, every class topper gets one-time incentive. ItтАЩs Rs 750 for some school classes. тАЬstudents can choose either of the scholarships offered by the Haryana government or the central government. But most students prefer Haryana government scholarships because these offer higher incentives than of the central government,тАЭ added the official. C N Bharti said they had raised the issue of non-disbursal of scholarships before Haryana Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar at a meeting held on July 29, where senior officers of the department were also present. тАЬIn a letter sent to Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (School Education) Mahavir Singh on Thursday, the Haryana Vidhyalya Adhyapak Sangh reminded how the government has assured to deposit the scholarships in the bank accounts of students concerned. But students are still waiting for the incentives,тАЭ added Bharti. When contacted, Director of State Secondary Education J Ganesan told The Indian Express that the one-time scholarship is normally given during commencement of the academic session. тАЬIt will be given for this year also on re-opening of schools. Others are attendance-based scholarships,тАЭ he added. Meanwhile, a senior officer of the Haryana higher education department said they have already disbursed the scholarships meant for government college students of Dalit and Backward Communities, while the process for release of scholarships for students of these communities for private added college is still on. тАЬWe have received applications of 28,000 students from private and aided colleges, for which the release of scholarships for 15,000 is almost in the final stage. We release the scholarships of these students only after receiving verification reports regarding their attendance. In case of colleges, the scholarships are released in the next academic year. But now we have sent a proposal to the social welfare department to release the scholarships in every quarter of the ongoing academic year because the students need financial help,тАЭ added the officer.

He further said that the criminals were growing bold and brazen because they were confident of support from the Chief Minister. ""Such atrocities were never witnessed when the TDP was in power. If the Chief Minister took strong action on the first incident, these series of attacks would not have happened later, and several victims would be spared from humiliation and harassment,"" he said. ""The accused in the two tonsure incidents that took place in the last two months were not afraid of facing the rule of law. The government has snatched way the land of Sankar Rao which is highly reprehensible. There is no safety and security for the lives, property, and self-respect of the weaker sections in Andhra Pradesh any more. The YSRCP made it a single point program to let loose criminals on all those raising their dissenting voices against the Government and then cover up their atrocities,"" Naidu added. Naidu further said, ""First, ruling party leaders targeted, harassed, arrested and humiliated the TDP leaders. Later, they launched atrocities against the leaders of the backward classes. Now, they are unleashing a reign of terror against innocent Dalits. False cases have been filed against all those who have agitated against the Government's excesses and illegal activities. Om Pratap's death was first termed as a suicide. Later, it was called a natural death and allowed the last rites to be performed. Finally, following criticism from the people, a secret post mortem was conducted."" He further said that there was ""no limit to the YSRCP's atrocities considering how another Dalit youth was said to have died in the 'overturning of a tractor.""""How were there burns on the body of the youth? The ruling party leaders should explain how the burns showed up on the body if it was an accidental death. The agitation should continue till these atrocities stop.

People from Dalit, Bahujan, and Adivasi communities fought many battles and wars against the oppressive colonial rule, while simultaneously fighting local and regional forms of marginalisation which was engendered by brahmins and the upper caste groups. However, due to historiographic invisibility, their resistances fail to feature on our history books.On the 74th Independence Day this year, we look back at those Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi women whose contributions to the Nationalist movement against the imperial exploitation is seldom acknowledged due to the multiple gaps in documentation in history as well as in contemporary times. Kuyili was the commander-in-chief to Velu Nachiyar, the Queen of Sivagangai, a place in the southern part of the Tamil Nadu. Remembered by her admirers as тАШVeerthalapathyтАЩ (The Brave Commander) or тАШVeeramangaiтАЩ (The Brave Woman), this freedom fighter was born in a lower caste family of Arunthathiyar. She led her army on an attack against the Britishers. In the process, drenched in oil, she set herself on fire and self-sacrificed her life. One of the most trusted companions and advisors of Rani Laxmibai, Jhalkaribai was a Dalit warrior from the Kori caste, who played a pivotal role in the first war of Independence, the Revolt of 1857. Impressed by her skills, Jhansi ki Rani inducted her in the womenтАЩs wing of the army, where Jhalkaribai was trained to shoot and ignite cannons to fight the wars against British rule. A Dalit freedom fighter, Uda Devi and her courageous Dalit sisters or Veeranginis (warriors) fought fearlessly against the British East India Company, infamous for looting local resources. Admirers remember her as a feisty and valiant Dalit woman who defied both caste and gender hierarchies enforced by the brahminical and patriarchal society. Also read: The Forgotten Dalit, Bahujan And Adivasi Women Who Fought For IndiaтАЩs Independence Helen Lepcha or better known as Sabitri Devi, played significant role in the Non-Co-operation Movement, where she led a rally of thousands of labourers from Jharia Coalfields in Kolkata. She also immersed herself in social activism. She was the chairperson of various associations in Kurseong like the Sherpa Association, Nagar Congress, Anjuman Islamia and the Lepcha association. Often referred to as the тАЬRani of the NagasтАЭ, first described by Jawaharlal Nehru, Rani Gaidinliu, at the age of 16, evaded the Britishers, before being captured and sentenced to life imprisonment, which ended only after IndiaтАЩs Independence. She mobilised people from the Zeliangrong tribe to resist paying taxes to the colonial regime and helped them evade the British forces. A Gorkha woman born in Kurseong, Putalimaya Devi Poddar was renowned within her community for fighting both against the imperial and social order. When Kurseong had established an office for the Congress Committee in 1936, she finally was able to concretise her ambition of becoming a freedom fighter. She also started a Harijan Samaj in Kurseong which dealt with mobilising Dalits and Shudras to receive an education.

Defying claims, the police officials said that the youth was not tortured and he had developed COVID like symptoms before dying. A resident of the Poore Baiju village under Lalganj Police Station limits of Rae Bareli, the deceased- MohitтАЩs family alleged that he died due to police torture. On August 26, Mohit along with his brother- Sonu was picked up from their residence in a theft case. As per information, Sonu alleged that the police had mercilessly beaten Mohit in the lockup, and on August 28 they released him but they kept Mohit in custody. The next day, MohitтАЩs health worsened and he was brought to the district hospital for treatment where he succumbed. The bereaved family members took to streets and on Sunday evening raised slogans against police atrocities. However, when the district and police administration did not reach the spot on time, the protestors came out on the road and blocked the Raebareli-Fatehpur National Highway. тАЬThe police were working against an auto-lifter gang, and during which four people were arrested and also 10 motorcycles were recovered. During an interrogation with the ones arrested, names of Sonu and his brother Mohit surfaced after which they were brought to the police station on August 28 for interrogation. During this, Mohit complained about stomach ache following which he was sent to the district hospital. He had a complaint of pneumonia and fever and his oxygen level was also low. He died during treatment. Preliminary investigation reveals that the accused were kept in illegal detention for more than 24 hours and for that we have suspended the SHO,тАЭ Superintendent of Police Raebareli, Swapnil Mamgain said. Responding to the youthтАЩs death, the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Chief Ajay Kumar Lallu attacked the state government and wrote, тАЬDalit youth dies in police custody in Rae Bareli. Police suppression of Dalits and the exploitation continues in the BJP government. Every day this 'Jungle Raj' causes one life or the other. There is a flood of killings but the government remains insensitive. The Chief Minister should come forward and answer the questions of the public.тАЭ","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

Citing news reports, the commission has observed that тАЬthe 40 scheduled caste families have been living in fear after people from the upper castes allegedly excommunicated them from the villageтАЭ. тАЬThe issue allegedly got momentum from a trivial matter of confrontation between the scheduled castes and the upper caste over plucking of flowers by some girls of the SC community,тАЭ it said. тАЬNow the said SC community people are barred from going to shop, sharecropping, doing work under MGNREGS,taking out procession, participating in social functions etc. for which they are unable to fetch day to day requirements also. It is also alleged that the villagers have stopped talking with the SC community people,тАЭ the commission stated. The order passed by the commissionтАЩs Chairperson Justice Bimla Prasad Das termed social ostracism/boycott an тАЬinhuman practiceтАЭ and emphasised that it requires serious attention and action by state authorities. тАЬIn this background while taking cognizance of the matter suo motu, we have no alternative than to caution the authorities to take effective steps against the persons responsible for it after due inquiry and give us a report. Let the Collector and the District Magistrate Dhenkanal and Superintendent of Police, enquire into the matter and give their respective reports to the commission,тАЭ the order stated. Meanwhile, following the intervention of authorities, the situation in the village is returning to normalcy. Sarpanch Pranabandhu Das said, тАЬWe have been holding repeated dialogues between the two communities. Things are now moving back to normal. The diktat to not speak to each other does not exist anymore.тАЭ The matter had escalated after the girls plucked flowers from the backyard of Saisdeba Behera (36). Behera said the communities are working towards resolving pending issues. тАЬI grow sunflowers and sell them for oil production. That day, three girls started plucking the flowers. I objected because they couldnтАЩt have used it for prayers, they were simply wasting the flowers. Soon their elders joined in and a brawl broke out between members of the two communities,тАЭ he said. тАЬWe reached out to the police and the matter was resolved, but the girls started making false allegations that I tried to misbehave. They approached the police with these false accusations. Because of this, multiple meetings were held and we decided to boycott them,тАЭ Behera added. Jyoti Naik, a member of the Dalit community, said, тАЬIt is true that the situation is limping to normalcy. But it will take a while to bury all issues and move ahead. For now, it is important that we are deprived of our rights.тАЭ ЁЯУг The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"523",4916,"https://www.dalitcamera.com/a-natural-disaster-or-one-in-the-making-for-several-decades/","A natural disaster or one in the making for several decades? ├В┬╖ Dalit Camera","Labour leader G Gomati, who has been fighting for the rights for the landless Dalits and tribals, who form a chunk of the workforce on the Kerala tea plantations, says the Pettumudi landslide should not be viewed in isolation but one that highlights the decades-long struggle of bondage for the plantation workers Written By Mrudula Bhavani | Translated from an article on Keyboard Journal |9th August On August 7, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan replied at a press briefing that the government is prepared to face flood and landslides as in previous two years, and the Pettimudi landslide in IdukkiтАЩs Rajamala is unexpected. When asked why government helicopters were not being used for rescue operations, he said he had received expert advice that the weather was adverse. The landless Dalits, workers, tribals, and those living along the coastal line always suffer the worst from environmental disasters. Governments need to develop sustainable strategies for their survival. In the massive landslide on the morning of August 7, families of 24 Tamil-Dalit workers at the Kannan Devan Hill Plantation tea estate in Pettimudi were buried deep under soil and rocks. G Gomati, the leader of the Pompilai Orumai strike of 2015 at the Kannan Devan Hills Plantation, said, тАЬLarge rocks and mud came and covered up the plantation as if there was nothing there.тАЭ The area had been out of reach for several days prior to the tragedy. тАЬA tragedy like this canтАЩt be called unexpected. Five years ago when we went on a strike, the media went into frenzy and тАШexposedтАЩ the workersтАЩ one-room houses,тАЭ says Gomati. But the buildings with the temporary housing for workers are old. The workers are forced to retain the facility just because they do not own any land. The families use it to keep their belongings but live on the plantation as the space is too little to accommodate the families. Even the road and the bridge to Pettimudi, which incurred damage in the 2018 floods, have not been repaired properly. тАЬIn order to end the strike, the company had promised to expand the facilities for the workers but that has not happened.тАЭ Gomati further points out that the workers would not sit in this rain if they had land or homes. тАЬNearly 85 people were living in the houses over three lanes (layams), each of which has six to 12 houses. About 49 workers died and a few were rescued. Everything else is under the soil,тАЭ rues Gomati. Most of the workers send their children to school with the minimum wage they earn working on the plantation. The children study at Adimali and Munnar Convent Schools because the parents are determined to provide them a good education. Several of these children died in the landslide. Eleven bodies released on Saturday of which three were unidentified. The death toll from the landslide rose to 42 by Sunday afternoon. тАЬWith the next election coming up, it looked like an opportunity to gain votes, so everyone visited the site of tragedy. But they do not understand our lives. We are forced to work for the company until the age of 60. If you retire, you are expected to leave the house with nowhere else to go. I have been talking about this injustice for long,тАЭ Gomati adds. The phone network and power supply were still in a state of disrepair on August 8 and strong winds and rain were expected. The rescue operation was carried out by the plantation workers, tribal people of Idamalakkudi and those who came from Marayoor and Munnar on foot before the government rescue operations reached Pettimudi. тАЬThis plantation is government property. Yet the government is not ready to take it over. The government has handed over its land to the monopolies. To be honest, this plantation work is a terrible job. Why live as a slave to politicians and company for meagre wage? Leeches suck our blood. We work in all extreme weather conditions. There is no good hospital or school nearby. I know the misery of the people who work in it. My father wanted me to get a good job and he didnтАЩt want me to work here. But my father could not fight like I did. My children will not have to suffer like I have. My children have to get out of the plantation,тАЭ points out Gomati. The plantation workers are all Dalits. And Gomati says that since they are landless, the children are also forced to follow their families into plantation work. Since the children do not know Malayalam, it adds to the challenges. In 2017, when the G Gomati, Rajeshwari and Kausalya organised a land struggle in Munnar town, raising the demand for one acre of land for a working family, the electricity minister and CPIM leader MM Mani issued anti-Dalit and misogynistic statement against the agitation. As a member of Devikulam Block Panchayat, Gomati has been subjected to discrimination and boycott in Munnar town and on KSRTC buses. When she contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, GomatiтАЩs manifesto focussed on the rehabilitation of tea plantation workers from the companyтАЩs farms, amendment of the Plantation Labor Act, increase in bonus over the present wage of Rs 400, setting up of a multi-specialty hospital in Munnar, schools and colleges for Dalits and tribals, special schemes for farmers in flood-hit Idukki. During the election, Gomati had made it clear that she felt alone in her struggle against the geopolitics and plantation monopoly of the flood-hit Munnar and the whole of Idukki. She had said that she had experienced racism towards Tamils and Dalits from Kerala. The vast hectares of Kannan Devan-TATA plantation was given in lease to JD Monroe and AW Tanner in 1879. They, under the North Travancore Land Planning and Agricultural Society, cultivated coffee and cardamom. In 1897, Finlay Mueller and the Glasgow Company began cultivating tea in the area. Tata Finley Ltd was formed in 1976 with the James Finley Group. Tata acquired the company in 1983 and formed Kannan Devan Hills Plantation Company Pvt Ltd in 2005. The company became a major player in the production and export of tea from south India. The seven tea estates on the 23,783-hectare plantation employ 10,000 people. When the majority of women workers began their strike in 2015, triggering a demand for wage hikes, the company owners alleged external links to the movement. The plantation workers then put forward the suggestion of better education for the new generations, the use of mechanisation for plucking tea shoots, and the enactment of legislation to make land available to each worker on their own, as a means of breaking out of the caste bondage of plantation work. In the interview with Madhyamam weekly in 2018, Gomati said that the intelligence agency and the police had followed her since the land struggle was declared. As a result of intimidation she had to vacate her house in Munnar. She moved to Poomala. тАЬEveryone is talking about the beauty of Munnar. The outside world knows whatтАЩs going on here, but no one responds. The poor have no land here. But these politicians can encroach and own land anywhere. Is anyone talking about Joyce George MP? All these politicians own cottages and acres of land. They all grew up on our blood. Our land struggle is not just for the tea plantation workers, it is for the landless Dalits and adivasis. тАЭ Gomathi finds it oppressive to declare compensation to the deaths. тАЬThis is oppressive. It happens from time to time. The government has priced their lives at Rs 5 lakh. The rains of August have just begun, who knows what else is awaiting Munnar? Many have filed complaints to get their houses furnished or built, if anything happens to them wonтАЩt they too be rated by compensation like this?тАЭ Mrudula Bhavani is an independent journalist. captures narratives, public meetings, songs, talks, discussion on dalits.

"524",4921,"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/history-of-dalit-movements-in-nepal.html","History of Dalit movements in Nepal: Much has been achieved, but discrimination still exists","Home ┬╗ Heritage ┬╗ History ┬╗ History of Dalit movements in Nepal: Much has been achieved, but discrimination still exists Dalits are those communities that have been oppressed, and marginalised in the worst forms for millenniums in the name of caste, the major practice of social stratification in the Hindu society in South Asia. Also termed тАШAchhootsтАЩ (meaning тАШuntouchables) by the radical enforcers of the extremely rigid caste system, the Dalits are not included even in the traditional four Varnas and are referred to as тАШPanchamasтАЩ. In an orientalist historical explanations, untouchability originated when Indo-Aryan community migrated to the Indian subcontinent in around 1,500 BCE and deemed the indigenous community inferior in terms of cultural and racial aspects. Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text written around 1,250-1,000 BCE, incorporated the caste system as the basis of order and regularity тАШto preserve the purity of race and blood, ostracising the indigenous community into Achhoots. IndiaтАЩs BR Ambedkar, however, declines to accept this multiracial notion of Aryans and non-Aryans and the purity. He defines caste as an artificial stratification of people into fixed and definite units. He presents the caste system not as a racial division but as a social division of people of the same race. In Nepal, the earliest caste system is said to have come to practice in Khas Rajya (modern-day western Nepal) in the 12th century when Brahmins from the then independent states in India came to the Sinja valley. Dor Bahadur BistaтАЩs Fatalism and Development details how the caste system was introduced in Khas Rajya during the early medieval period. Likewise, the caste system was introduced in Kathmandu Valley by King Jayasthiti Malla with the assistance of his five pandits in the 14th century by introducing four Varnas and 64 Jaats. In modern times, Prithvi Narayan Shah declared his unified territory as the country of four Varnas and 36 Jaats. Jung Bahadur Rana legitimised the caste system through the countryтАЩs first documented law, Muluki Ain (Civil Code) 1854, and also included non-Hindu groups in the caste system. The legal code documented the castes into four types: The root of the word тАШDalitтАЩ is тАШDalanтАЩ, which translates to oppression in Sanskrit, Nepali and Hindi languages. Hence, тАШDalitтАЩ means тАШoppressedтАЩ. Perhaps, the word was first used by the Indian reformer Jyotirao Phule. Although Mahatma Gandhi proposed and used the term тАШHarijanтАЩ or тАШchildren of godтАЩ in 1932, Ambedkar used and popularized the word тАШDalitтАЩ as a quasi-class term, referring to a class of people at the rock-bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy. Whether one believes the colonial orientalist view or the countering view of Ambedkar, it is undeniable that the Dalits have been ostracised and oppressed for more than three millenniums since the Vedic age. When the caste system was introduced in Khas Rajya, it created a hierarchical and social difference among the people of the state. Similarly, while many historians see the division of the caste system based on peopleтАЩs occupation as a reform, it also led to segregation and oppression. For example, people from the lowest caste in the Kathmandu valley in the medieval period were not allowed to have tiles on their roofs and had to show respect to the people of the higher caste. Practising the caste system inflicted discrimination so much so that it would deny even the basic rights to the people from the lowest castes. Jung Bahadur Rana encouraged discrimination based on castes through the Muluki Ain, which was already in practice in the Nepali society. The punishments were set based on caste as the Brahmins were not given capital punishments while the people from the lowest castes would get severe ones. Similarly, marriage was made endogamic, i.e., within the same caste for the sake of purity. The people labelled as impure were denied even the basic social, economic, cultural, intellectual, and political rights. They were not allowed to touch tap water used by people of a higher caste, could not enter temples, would be punished if they married from a higher caste. They had no participation in politics and education and were even prohibited to touch people and their belongings. The history of Dalit movements in Nepal can be traced parallel to the countryтАЩs political history. The first wave of Dalit assertion in Nepal began in 1947 in a village called Thadaswara in Baglung district when Sarvajit Bishwakarma established an organisation called Vishwa Sarvajan Sangh to challenge the existing caste system and wore a тАШjanaiтАЩ (the sacred thread) against the oppression. In the Kathmandu valley, the successful movement of the Pashupati Temple Entrance Campaign in 1954 is considered one of the first movements. Many other organisations such as TailorтАЩs Union (1947), Nepal Samaj Sudhar Sangh (2947), Nepal Harijan Sangh (1947) were established before the democratic struggle against the Rana regime in 1951, while many other organisations were established for Dalit movements and upliftment during NepalтАЩs first tenure of democracy in 1950-60. The Interim Government of Nepal Act (1951) was the first legal document to recognise people, including Dalits, as тАШcitizensтАЩ with civil and political rights. The autocratic Panchayat regime formulated the New Muluki Ain in 1963 and tried to abolish untouchability in the legal and social systems. During the Panchayat era, nine more organisations were established for the upliftment of Dalits. As the country adopted the free market policy after the restoration of democracy in 1990, it also sought to provide welfare through private development partners such as national and international non-government organisations (I/NGOs). Many organisations emerged with slogans of Dalit emancipation. As the Dalit movement rose, the government formed the Dalit Commission in 2002 and brought many programmes such as scholarships and reservations. And, although such steps were not adequate to abolish caste-based discrimination, it certainly boosted the morale of Dalit rights activism. Dalits had an important role during the decade-long Maoist Insurgency (1996-2006) as thousands of Dalit men and women participated in the armed conflict while around 200 were killed.  The country headed to a more participatory federal system post the second PeopleтАЩs Movement in 2006. The issues of Dalits have been covered on the national agenda and the Dalit movement has gradually progressed although it is yet to be institutionalised. The major achievement during the last decade has been the criminalisation of caste-based discrimination through the Caste-based Discrimination and Untouchability Crime Elimination and Punishment Act in 2011, and the Constitution of Nepal (2015) endorsing the rights and opportunities for the Dalits for their upliftment. Moreover, the constitution recognised the National Dalit Commission as a constitutional body, and the National Dalit Commission Act 2017 was enacted to ensure opportunities for Dalits. Similarly, the Nepali Parliament has reserved certain seats for Dalits and other excluded communities in the proportional representation system to ensure participation in the political spheres. As per the election laws, 13.8% of the PR seats in the House of Representatives, as well as the provincial assemblies, are allocated for Dalits while the seven provinces must select at least one Dalit representative each among eight seats allocated to them for the National Assembly. Moreover, at least one woman between two women members in each ward of a local government must be from the Dalit community to ensure participation. The discrimination against Dalits is still a prevailing issue in Nepal as reports of discrimination, prejudice and even hate crimes emerge from time to time. In recent times, the news broke out about the killing of six people from the Dalit community in Rukum (West) as one of the victim tried to elope with a girl from a higher caste. The devastating news did not only shake the nation but brought out again the discourse on discrimination and oppression on the Dalits.

V Saridha, president of J Krishnapuram Panchayat in Coimbatore, said that she was facing problems due to her caste since she was elected as Panchayat chief. тАЬP Balasubramaniam, a Caste Hindu, has been hurling casteist slurs at me whenever I passed by their localities,тАЭ said Saridha, who was backed by the DMK. He and his aides have been preventing her from discharging her duties, she alleged. Saridha said that she has been tolerating the casteist abuses to maintain harmony in the village. тАЬBut recently, he came to the Panchayat office and threatened me and the office sweeper that I shouldnтАЩt sit in the chair whenever he visits the office,тАЭ she said. She said Balasubramaniam doesnтАЩt behave this way when other Panchayat functionaries, who are Caste Hindus, are in the office. Moreover, she alleged that none of her colleagues in the village stood by her. Based on her complaint, Coimbatore police have registered a case against the accused under sections 3(1)(m) (intimidating a member of SC who is a chairperson of a panchayat), 3(1)(r) (intentionally insulting with intent to humiliate a member of an SC in any place of within public view), and 3(1)(s) (abusing a member of SC by caste name in any place within public view) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. An investigation is on into this matter. Related news: Dalits face social boycott in Odisha as girl caught plucking flowers Superintendent of Police Ara Arularasu said that the panchayat leaderтАЩs complaint might be politically motivated since Balasubramaniam has no role in the panchayat office. However, sources in the Panchayat office told The Federal that Balasubramaniam had been constantly abusing her and that police might be taking a lenient view since he was an AIADMK man. тАЬEarlier, Balasubramaniam was with the DMK. The AIADMK started backing him after a Dalit woman was made the panchayat president against the wishes of a few DMK locals.

They were under preventive custody and released later,"" Prasad said.

Ayodhya: A Dalit family is the first to get the prasad sent by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath after the 'bhumi pujan' of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, an official said on Thursday. The prasad included laddoos, a copy of the Ramcharitmanas and tulsi mala, Chief Minister's Media Advisor Shalabh Mani Tripathi told PTI.

As many as 10 Dalits were killed and 26 injured by Special Reserve Police Force (SRPF) led by PSI Manohar Kadam on 11 July 1997 in GhatkoparтАЩs Ramabai Nagar of Mumbai. The residents had witnessed Dr Babasaheb AmbedkarтАЩs statue garlanded with sandals at dawn on Friday, causing anger among them and this resulted into protests. The crowd reportedly enforced rasta roko, blocking the Eastern Express Highway and lodged a complaint to the Beat No.5 of Pantnagar Police Station which is situated within Ramabai Nagar. In no time, a total of four vans of SRPF arrived near the statue and began firing into the crowd. тАЬThe distance between the statue and the police force was fifty steps when they opened fire in the alleys of the colonyтАЭ, said Jaywant Hire, a senior journalist and a social activist from Ramabai Nagar. тАЬNamdeo Surwade came running to me when he was shot on his arm. He told me that firing was going on inside. I immediately called several ministers and media after seeing the site, and around 12 in the noon, police arrested me from my houseтАЭ, he added. Soon тАШMumbai BandhтАЩ was declared with shutters pulled down and railway tracks uprooted, bringing trains to halt and traffic being diverted from the nearby areas. The Dalit strongholds of Mumbai witnessed stone-pelting incidents as well. A twenty-two-year-old Hitesh Bhalerao was killed in a protest against the Ramabai Nagar incident in the eastern suburbs of Kurla when the police opened fire on the crowd. Raghunath Jadhav was on his way to work and while walking to the bus stop he was shot in his arm, тАЬI was clueless where the bullet came from. A boy came running to me saying your arm is bleeding and I fell unconscious right after.тАЭ The police force lathi-charged and used tear gas to disperse the residents who would take recourse inside the alleys of the colony for cover. тАЬI was shot just outside my house when I saw police entering the alley and started firing out of nowhere. I first thought it must be the sound of fireworks,тАЭ said Hiraman Gaikwad. The street was spattered with blood and the bullets pierced through tin-roofed homes. The brutal firing continued for nearly fifteen minutes and around fifty rounds of bullets were fired. тАЬA doctored video was recorded by Ravi Shinde, near the highway with a fabricated LPG tanker storyтАЭ, said Hire. Ramchandra Dhanawade, the father of Anil Dhanawade, broke down while narrating the gory details of losing his 18-year-old. тАЬHe was shot on his chest when he went to drop his nephew for school,тАЭ he said. In their defence, the police stated that they fired after the crowd set a passenger bus on fire and they (police) were apprehensive that they would set the tankers ablaze too. тАЬThey fired indiscriminately without observing any norms at all. Several bullets had hit above the waists of the victims. This situation was uncalled-forтАЭ, said Advocate B. G. Bansode, who represented Ramabai Nagar residents at Gundewar Commission. Among the victims, Sukhdev Kapadne, Nandu Katare, Sanjay Nikam, Amar Dhanawade, Vilas Dodke, Anil Garud, Sanjay Kamble, Mangesh Shivsharan, Bablu Verma, Kausabai Pathare were killed on spot. The Maharashtra state government soon appointed The Gundewar Commission, headed by Justice S.D. Gundewar for conducting a detailed investigation of the incident.  The Gundewar Commission submitted the report in both State Legislative Council and Assembly stating тАШthere was no need for the SRPF to begin firing and whosoever instigated the incident should discontinue from the police force.тАЭ тАЬThe victims who were injured in the incident were blamed as accusers in the sessions court by Manohar Kadam and the inquiry went on for a yearтАЭ, said Shyam Gaikwad, a senior activist. тАШHatyakand Virodhi Sangharsh SamitiтАЩ was founded in 1997 by Gaikwad to help the victims of the Ramabai Nagar incident to fight cases and support them with legislative work. тАЬBoth Ramabai residents and Manohar Kadam had their magistrates, while the hearing needed to take place in the same court,тАЭ said Advocate Rajesh Karamkar. тАЬThe residents were booked under three cases falling under section 334, 335 and 336 IPC (voluntarily causing grievous hurt on provocation and negligent act on personal safety to be punished with imprisonment) respectively.

Previously, convicted under section 304 IPC (culpable homicide with imprisonment) PSI Manohar Kadam was granted bail in the year 2009 when Bombay High Court suspended his life sentence by a vacation bench of Justices Anand Nirgude and Rajesh Ketkar. тАЬManohar Kadam was never incarcerated in his entire term of imprisonment.

In all her 40 years, moments that gave her hope have been few and far between. She lives in a slum settled by manual scavengers in Kachiguda suburb of Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Telangana. She was married at 23 to a man who earned his living as a manual scavenger and whose persistent dowry demands meant continued abuse that culminated in her being thrown out of the house. Three kids later, her husband, in her words, тАЬleft me forever even though my third child was a son after two daughters.тАЭ Ranjitha was forced to go back to her maternal home where the commerce graduate, for want of better opportunity, joined her mother in manual scavenging work to support herself and her family. Manual scavenging is a centuries-old abhorrent practice of humans cleaning excrement from private and public toilets тАУ one that still continues despite stringent legal provisions to end it. Table 1 estimates the number of dry latrines тАУ toilets that do not flush and require daily manual cleaning тАУ in India. The practice of manual scavengingThe inhumane practice is what millions more like Ranjitha, who belongs to the scheduled caste/Dalit community, rely on for a living in India. Manual scavengers are considered the lowest in this regressive social stratification and treated as тАЬuntouchables among untouchables.тАЭ As many as 95% of manual scavengers are women, and they are not only denied basic rights but also confront multiple challenges in all spheres of life. A casteist, patriarchal and exclusionary socio-economic construct has ensured they remain at the margins of society. Table 1: Number of Dry Latrines in India * Census of India 2011 only includes data in row 1 and does not recognize the categories and numbers provided in rows 2, 3 and 5. Working to end manual scavengingIn 1993, the Indian Parliament passed a law banning manual scavenging but did not include penal provisions for those who hire people for such work. In 2013, due to a concerted legal campaign by Safai Karamchari Andolan (SKA), a network of about 4,800 volunteers committed to the vision of ending this practice and restoring dignity to manual scavengers, the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013 was enacted. The law made it an offense to engage a person as a manual scavenger and doing so carried up to a year in jail and/or a fine of Rs 50,000 or $670 as punishment. However, in the nine years since its enactment there have been no convictions under this law. This is despite the Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment identifying 53,398 manual scavengers across the country. The 2013 law also provided that manual scavengers be given a one-time cash assistance (OTCA) of Rs.40,000 or $539 each, and access to training to get them suitable employment. Additionally, they are eligible for a low-interest loan of up to Rs.15 lakh or $20,230 each to start a new venture. The National Safai Karamchari Finance Development Corporation (NSKFDC), which is the nodal agency tasked to address manual scavenging, in its 22nd Annual Report states that it released Rs.72.32 crore or $9.75 million in 2018-19 as OTCA to 18,081 manual scavengers. However, a specific scheme by the NSKFDC for women sanitation workers/scavengers and their daughters, Mahila Adhikarita Yojana, has been able to cover only 5,602 women beneficiaries in the last three years. It is clear that women like Ranjitha and her mother have not benefitted from such initiatives. It is also worth noting that the 2020-21 Union budget allocated the same amount of Rs. 110 crore or $14.83 million as it did last year for rehabilitating manual scavengers, even though 2019 recorded the highest number of fatalities among sewerage workers in recent years. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemicRanjithaтАЩs life took another turn when she was diagnosed with endometriosis and had to undergo surgery. Her mother decided it was time she stopped working as a manual scavenger and enrolled her in a computer training program, which equipped her with basic computer skills. She soon found employment in a private firm doing medical transcription for a monthly salary of Rs.4000 or $53. After ten years of employment, she was earning Rs.14,000 or $188 a month. But then COVID-19 hit, and the government announced a nation-wide lockdown with just a few hours notice. Her employer fired everyone and she lost her job. Ranjitha found herself yet again in an extremely vulnerable situation, with no savings, no job and the immediate pressure to find food to feed her family. Mehthar gully (or alley) where Ranjitha lives is home to manual scavengers and sanitation workers who have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 in many ways: Those working in hospitals or contracted by the local municipalities are forced to work extra hours with no extra allowances, transportation or protective gear. Manual scavengers are also expected to carry out other тАЬpollutingтАЭ tasks, including disposing of dead animals, cleaning placentas after delivery and various funeral-related activities. Those employed by private households to clean their toilets lost their job due to the misconception that they are unclean and would transmit the virus. Ranjitha dismally noted, тАЬEarlier, some of our people working as cooks used to hide the fact that they resided in Mehthar gully else they wouldnтАЩt have been allowed to cook. Now, this virus has again made us untouchable. It is the rich who brought the virus with them on airplanes, but the impact of this virus has been the worst for us. Men will easily get into septic tank cleaning, but women wonтАЩt find any work. We all have taken loans and our indebtedness is increasing. All our people have been without work and wages for the last five months.тАЭ The government announced a package to provide relief, but it has not reached those most in need. Says Ranjitha, тАЬThe local administration gave us 1 kg good quality rice, 6 kg low quality rice, half kg pulses and 2 masks. We are 13 members in our family. How will this be enough? They are telling us to follow hygiene, sanitize hands and wear masks, but when we donтАЩt have money to even buy food, how can we purchase sanitizer and masks?тАЭ Mobilizing the community Given the unprecedented humanitarian crisis that unfolded as a result of the policy response to COVID-19, SKA, like many other NGOs and networks, facilitated relief distribution and crisis management to people in distress in 11 states across the country. Out of these 11, the International Budget Partnership (IBP) has supported SKA to provide relief to 1,000 households across four states: 258 households in Delhi, 230 in Telangana, 258 in Andhra Pradesh and 300 in Tamil Nadu. Rough estimates by the network peg their total outreach to 8,000 households. This effort is one piece of SKAтАЩs campaign, as part of IBPтАЩs SPARK initiative, to bolster the leadership and agency of women manual scavengers to demand their entitlements and advocate for better implementation of government schemes. SKA has identified 116 women leaders in 30 settlements across four states of Delhi, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Ranjitha is one of the 116. During the lockdown in April, SKA volunteers reached out to Ranjitha and asked her to lead relief distribution efforts in her community. She made a list of all eligible families in the slum settlement and offered her home as the makeshift depot to store relief supplies. SKA volunteers guided her on basic distribution protocol. In the words of Mr. Bezwada Wilson, national convenor of SKA, тАЬFor the first time, in my 35 years of movement background, I am involved in relief distribution as this crisis has redefined our understanding of poverty. Still we have tried not to follow the traditional approach where those who distribute are powerful and those who receive provisions are weak. We have tried to organize this in a power-neutral model.тАЭ RanjithaтАЩs eyes lit up as she spoke about her role, тАЬI am so proud to have done the distribution. People in my community look up to me now, come and seek my advice on tackling problems that we face such as childrenтАЩs education and access to government schemes. Even though I am separated from my husband, I could sustain because I was educated, but all our people are not educated so skilling them is important. We need to come together as part of SKA and start thinking about next steps.тАЭ RanjithaтАЩs words made us realize that not only does she feel valued but also has begun to think about solutions to help her community, to mobilize them into action. This might just be the spark to start the revolution for a more just and equitable India.

The laying down of the foundation stone at Ayodhya is a historic occasion for Ram bhakts around the world. For Hindus it should mark the end for the struggle for a grand Ram temple. Bhagwan Ram occupies a special place in millions of hearts. Ram was the prince who forsake his claim over kingdom just to ensure that his father kept his pledge. Ram was the loving husband who travelled from the northern end of India to the southern kingdom of Lanka, to free his wife from the clutches of Ravana. Ram was the champion of class equality who ate the half-eaten ber of Shabri, his bhakt from the downtrodden caste. Ram embraced the boatman Kevat, who ferried him across the river and made him his life-long friend. Ram, the protector, saved the rishis and munis from the onslaught of demons and he elevated the status of the monkeys in his army to the level of human beings. After wandering about in the forests for 14 years Ram ruled the kingdom of Ayodhya so efficiently that his model of administration has become the touchstone of governance. It is known as Ram Rajya, the rule of Ram that was perfect in all dimensions. Tragically, Ram had to give up the companionship of his dear wife briefly after he became king. He did it to lay down high standards of social conduct for his people. I am personally aggrieved at this decision of Ram, but the moot point is that even if Ram did something that gave precedence to popular demand over justice, he did it not for personal gains, but for the larger cause of society. Ram, the warrior, the giver, the sufferer, the pacifier, the ruler, the highest man among men even though a Vishnu incarnate, has finally received recognition from the highest court in India. His birthplace shall now have a temple that we Ram bhakts have craved for a long, long time. The process of construction of a magnificent Ram temple shall begin on August 5. Ram bhakts like me will make this day the most historic day in our lives and shall celebrate it forever. Can we also use this historic opportunity to give out a powerful statement? Yes, we can. Our Hindu darshana or philosophical canvas is broadly divided into six aastik schools of thought. Nyay and Vaisheshika; Sankhya and Yoga: Poorv Mimamsa and Uttar Mimamsa. The last named darshana is also referred to as Vedant, drawn from the concluding part of the Vedas. It quenches the thirst of those who are Gyan Yogis, travellers on the path of supreme knowledge. The Vedant school of philosophy is devoid of any 'karm-kand' or the rituals and ceremonies that have come to become the most visible face of Sanatan Dharma. Vedant lays utmost importance to equality of all human beings. It propounds that all 'jeev-aatman' (souls of the living) are nothing but part of 'Brahm', the ultimate power, the supreme reality. And yet, in the real world, the followers of Sanatan Dharma are divided into the useless silos of caste. And the caste compartments are not based upon profession but predetermined by birth. This is the most unfortunate practice of the highly enlightening and truly emancipating Hindu religion. Over several centuries, the practice of caste system has destroyed the very fabric of Hindusim. Atrocities on Dalits were common place before the advent of the 20th century. A large number of Dalits and other categories of scheduled caste citizens were forced to live a life of misery and misfortune in India. They were not considered as equal to the men and women of other castes and many generations of Dalits lived horrible lives. The situation in Independent India is much changed as we find that a Dalit leader like Mayawati could become the chief minister of India's most populous state on four occasions. The post of the President of our Republic has been adorned by a Dalit. Dalits have occupied top level positions in the civil administration, in the judiciary and in politics. In spite of all the positive changes, the mindset of many Indians remains caste-centric. A decade ago, as I stood in a queue to buy Indian Made Foreign Liquor at a retail counter in Uttarakhand, the guy ahead of me and the guy behind me asked me my caste (Brahmin or Rajput?) as we chatted along. Caste seems to remain one of the most common identity symbols even in these modern times. The Dalits of India are still looked down upon by many Indians. They may get a tepid welcome inside the living rooms of high caste born Hindus but they are still not considered as equals. How many high caste families can claim that their best family friends are Dalits? A high caste man can count a Brahmin or a Bania or a Rajput or a Kayasth as his best friend, but you would often find that that Dalits would be missing from this equation. My close friend, a Dalit employed as chief engineer in a government department, still agonises when he remembers how badly his grandfather was treated in his ancient village in Bengal. He once recounted, ""My grandfather was at the bottom of the pyramid in the village hierarchy and he was responsible for disposal of all dead animals in the village. He had no authority to refuse to carry out any work in this regard."" ""One day when he was suffering from high fever, he was beaten up when he showed up late to do the work that he was assigned to do, by birth!"" Mind you, my friend and his father (who too was an engineer in a government department) claimed the benefits of reservations meant for scheduled caste students and employees. They got their engineering seats in university and perhaps some benefits in their departmental promotions on account of the reservation policy in government service and employment rules, but they both felt that there were occasions when their competence was challenged solely because of their caste. The lowliness of their caste rankled them all their lives. As our rural population will dwindle further and as industrial and service sectors will take more and more centrestage in contributing to the nation's GDP, caste barriers shall decline further. Migration from villages to towns and large cities is already breaking the 'what-is-your-caste' mentality of young Indians. To give a massive body blow to the caste mentality, the Ram Mandir's bhoomi puja (stone-laying ceremony) must be done by a Dalit girl child. This will send a transformational message to the Dalits in India and will give them a sense of belonging. Bhagwan Ram broke the barrier when he embraced Kevat, the boatman and shared a fruit with Shabri, the poor woman of low caste. Prime Minister Modi washed the feet of sanitary staff during the Kumbh Mela in February 2019. He is a social reformer in a distinctive way. He has challenged the status quo in many fields and his action of washing the feet of sanitary workers was a very, very, potent message across the length and breadth of India. If the PM gives the historic opportunity of laying the foundation stone of the Ram temple to a Dalit girl, it will act like a Mohammed Ali punch on the caste culture that prevents the physical, mental, psychological and spiritual integration of Dalits with the others in Sanatan society.

"532",4970,"https://kractivist.org/the-struggle-against-dalit-oppression-in-india/","The Struggle Against Dalit Oppression in India - Kractivism","Painting by Mr. Siddesh Gautam By Kunal Chattopadhyay Anand Teltumbde is a man of many shades. A senior professor at the Goa Institute of Management who identifies as a Marxist, Teltumbde has multiple qualifications: a degree in engineering from NagpurтАЩs Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, a management degree from the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and a doctorate in cybernetics from the University of Mumbai. But his public persona is that of a Dalit writer and intellectual, and a long-time activist concerned with Dalit and civil-liberties issues. In his long-running column for the Economic and Political Weekly, Teltumbde has often been critical of IndiaтАЩs existing Dalit leadership. He recently turned seventy in a Mumbai prison, having been taken into police custody three months earlier under preposterous terrorism-related charges filed by the National Investigation Agency. His book Republic of Caste is a collection of essays, reworked for publication, that take up a set of key issues concerning the relationship between caste and class, and assesses where Dalits stand today. Teltumbde develops his own perspective on Dalit emancipation through a critique of IndiaтАЩs mainstream communist and Ambedkarite political movements. In a chapter on the relationship between Marxism and the Ambedkarite movements, Teltumbde explores the gulf between two currents that should be allies, but are quite often hostile to each other. The overwhelming majority of Dalits are working class, or rural proletarians and semi-proletarians. But there has been very little serious collaboration between the Dalit liberation movements and the Indian left. Teltumbde argues that Marx was aware of caste as a major impediment to IndiaтАЩs progress; both he and Lenin stressed the need for Marxists to focus on objective reality. He criticizes the approach of the Indian communists to the caste question, which was shaped by two factors: practical and intellectual. One was the fact that the bulk of left-wing leaders were upper caste. An unconscious Brahminism made them ignore the special oppression of Dalits. At a theoretical level, they sought to explain caste тАФ or explain it away тАФ through a crude application of MarxтАЩs base-superstructure metaphor. Their problem in making sense of IndiaтАЩs caste system was similar to the one facing Marxists in other parts of the world when dealing with questions of race, ethnicity, or gender тАФ forms of social oppression that cannot simply be subsumed under a reductionist class approach. As Teltumbde shows, Dr B. R. Ambedkar, the most influential leader of the struggle for Dalit emancipation, demonstrated the possibility of class- and caste-based movements coming together. He tried to organize trade unions, formed an Independent Labour Party (ILP, named after the British party of the same name), and urged the communist-led Girni Kamgar Union to address the question of caste segregation in employment, which would help foster class unity on terms favorable to the most oppressed groups. It is IndiaтАЩs communist organizations that Teltumbde indicts. Over the last thirty years or so, different sectors of the communist movement тАФ using that term in the widest possible sense тАФ have concerned themselves with Dalits and made demands relevant to their social condition. However, there remains a strong belief among them that caste as a special oppression can be solved within the limits of capitalism, through some sort of equalization process. Teltimbde appears to side partly with radicals within the left-wing movements who want to overturn capitalism, and partly with Dalits who argue that caste oppression must be integral to any fight for emancipation. But he does so within a Marxist framework, suggesting that Marxists should see class unity as something that develops through a struggle against an enemy class, rather than as a pre-existing reality around which a movement can be built. In the course of that struggle, there will always be differences that have to be addressed and negotiated. However, the points missing from his argument, or the simplifications that he makes, prevent him from proceeding further in his critique of IndiaтАЩs several communist parties. One such factor should be stressed here. The bulk of the communist movement in India falls into one of two camps. First of all, there are those advocating for a basically parliamentary road, however dressed up with revolutionary rhetoric it may be. They are committed to a two-stage theory of revolution, according to which the enemy in the first stage is imperialism, semi-feudalism, and only particular sections of capital, rather than capitalism as such. Second of all, there are those advocating for a Maoist-style revolution rooted in the countryside, favoring insurrection over parliamentary politics, but also see imperialism, semi-feudalism, and comprador capitalists as the enemy. The section of the far left which is oriented towards the urban working class and mass struggle is much smaller, and its arguments have very little impact on the political scene. As a result, Indian Marxist analysis of caste has most often related to the problem of тАЬsemi-feudalism.тАЭ This means that a blindness to caste divisions within the working class has persisted, because they have trouble perceiving caste as something that survives under modern capitalism, rather than as a relic of semi-feudal conditions. Even when Marxists formally acknowledged that such divisions exist, they do not take seriously the need for strategies to combat them in order to unify the class. As Teltumbde himself points out, if the communist movement had taken caste seriously from the beginning, a separate Dalit movement should not have been necessary. Teltumbde also takes a critical look at Dr Ambedkar himself, and those who claim the mantle of Ambedkarism. He examines AmbedkarтАЩs philosophical pragmatism, relating it to his teacher John Dewey, and presents Ambedkar as a kind of Fabian socialist. This explains his attitude to Marxian communism тАФ critical of their methods, while sometimes sympathetic to certain goals. In the 1930s, when Ambedkar believed that reform within Hinduism to ensure equality for Dalits was not possible, he turned to class as a category, launching the Independent Labour Party (ILP). But the actual ILP candidates put up in the elections of 1937 mostly came from the Mahar sub-caste among Dalits: it was unable to attract support from other sections of the working class, even among Dalits, showing the gap between the partyтАЩs ambition and its achievement. Later, in 1946, when Ambedkar proposed a model of state socialism in the tract тАЬStates and Minorities,тАЭ he again came to use the language of class, although he wrote the treatise itself on behalf of the United Scheduled Castes Federation. AmbedkarтАЩs differences with the communists also included his approach to the state, and to education. He was opposed to any violent revolution, hoping for change without bloodshed, and expected the educated middle-class intelligentsia to take the lead. In spite of these differences, Teltumbde suggests, Marxism remained a reference point for Ambedkar, even if it was only to argue that his methods were better than those of the Marxists. This implies that he saw the Marxists as his competitors, albeit inferior ones. One conflict zone between them was in Bombay, where both Ambedkar and the communists were active. In the cityтАЩs textile mills, communists dominated the powerful union for half a century. Dalits found themselves debarred from jobs in the better-paid weaving section, as the non-Dalit workers believed they would be polluted if they touched threads that Dalits had woven. As late as 1938, Ambedkar was still raising this issue. One would search in vain for any communist intervention here. The assumption that class unity could be achieved only by sweeping the caste fault lines under the carpet would eventually come back to haunt the communists. As Teltumbde notes, they tended to locate caste in the тАЬsuperstructure,тАЭ even though caste locations were very often linked to production. On the other hand, he is deeply critical of latter-day Ambedkarite groups for their preoccupation with electoral politics. They were as opportunistic as the mainstream electoral CPs, and were quite aggressively anti-communist, as well as hero-worshipping Ambedkar. He argues that Ambedkar himself would have firmly rejected this approach. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages in India, memes have appeared on social media claiming that Indian doctors cannot treat patients properly because of reservations, which have supposedly eliminated the meritorious. This is a reference to the policy of affirmative action: the reservation of places in publicly funded schools and colleges for a range of socially deprived, historically oppressed and marginalized groups, with similar arrangements for public-sector jobs. As Teltumbde correctly says, any discussion of caste in India soon enough becomes a discussion of reservations. One might gather the impression from such debates that casteism would not be a serious issue were it not for reservations. TeltumbdeтАЩs take is a complex one. He is sharply critical of the elite and forward caste critics of reservations, who talk of тАЬmerit,тАЭ ignoring the social hierarchies that surround each individual. He notes that opponents of reservations ignore the fact that their much-revered Hindu social order was based on тАЬreservationsтАЭ of the worst kind. Brahmins did not have to display any merit to assume dominance over society; the untouchables did not have to commit any crime to be condemned for generations to a societal hell. At the same time, Teltumbde is skeptical about reservations based on caste, albeit for reasons very different from those of the Brahmanical elite. He points out that the logic of having a set of reserved seats in local, provincial, or central legislatures would have made sense only if there had been a separate electorate. Dalits being a small fragment of the population, even in reserved seats, and especially at the higher levels, the Dalit candidates most likely to win are those approved by the bourgeois parties, which are themselves dominated by the upper castes. As a result, the policy of reservations, instead of becoming a way to build a strong Dalit fighting force, has led to the co-option of a small layer of Dalit politicians. He argues that Panchayati Raj тАФ a system of local self-government in rural districts тАФ has become de facto ruled by the dominant castes. However, there are problems with TeltumbdeтАЩs arguments about reservations. It would be one thing if all the places available through the reservations policy had been filled up throughout India. But as Maroona Murmu of KolkataтАЩs Jadavpur University has shown, reservations have not been properly utilized, in spite of the egalitarian promises of the Indian constitution. Take one example Murmu gives from the higher-education system of West Bengal: in the 2014тАУ15 academic year, out of 49,217 professors, just 3,037 came from Scheduled Castes (6.16 percent), and a mere 451 from Scheduled Tribes (less than 1 percent). The core argument Teltumbe makes is for a strategy that brings class and caste together. This does not mean endorsing the fakery of тАЬeconomic reservation,тАЭ whereby the authorities are to reserve seats for the тАЬpoor,тАЭ rather than simply on caste grounds. Since the reservation policy is intended to deal with forms of social exclusion that are similar to racism, it is not related to poverty. If poor students lack the necessary resources, the answer is to provide more funding for the education system. Teltumbde believes that there is a need to reform reservation strategies at the very least. If caste has to be annihilated тАФ as Ambedkar demanded in a famous pamphlet тАФ then a caste-based reservation policy, operating in an environment where only untouchability is abolished, not the caste system itself, does not really seek to get rid of social inequality and oppression. Dalit intellectuals and activists had hoped that the untouchable castes who were at the forefront of the original struggles led by Ambedkar would forge a broader unity among various oppressed Dalit subcastes. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is based on this conception тАФ the term тАЬBahujanтАЭ referred to all non-elite castes. In practice, however, instead of building such unity, those castes projected themselves as superior and tended to concentrate advantages for their own benefit. Although the BSP has been the most successful of all the attempts to build up a Dalit-based electoral party, it has disproportionately favored its core component, the subcaste of Jatavs/Chamars. The Hindutva forces identified this limitation better than anyone else. By supporting politicians of non-Jatav Dalit castes, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was able to eat dramatically into the electoral base of the BSP in Uttar Pradesh (UP). One chapter of TeltumbdeтАЩs book contains a valuable discussion of the BSP. It is not a Dalit party by self-definition: its name expresses its hope to constitute a majority bloc that would be wider than Dalits. In practice, even in UP where the BSP has been a regular fixture in coalition governments, it has not succeeded in winning support from shudras at the bottom of the caste hierarchy (now categorized among Other Backwards Classes or OBCs). Recent attempts to enlist Brahmins and other elite groups to the partyтАЩs side have eroded the Bahujan identity. Teltumbde does not make the same arguments as right-wing critics of the BSP, and points out the double standards of those critics, who never subject the BSPтАЩs rivals to the same harsh scrutiny. However, he believes that the BSP has largely ceased to be a vehicle that can truly fight for Dalit emancipation. In several chapters, Teltumbde takes on the role of the Indian state, examining its violence towards Dalits and its handling of dissent, even though it routinely claims to be the тАЬworldтАЩs largest democracy.тАЭ His book contains a detailed account of the Khairlanji massacre of September 2006. An upper caste mob murdered an entire family of Dalit Mahars, the Bhotmanges: the women were paraded naked and gang-raped before being killed, the genitals of the two boys were crushed with stones, and all the bodies were thrown callously into a canal. In contrast with many other such cases, the government had to take action of some kind because of protests initiated by local Dalit women and taken up by Dalits elsewhere. Having been forced to assign the case to a fast-track lower court, the government made sure of the appointment of a public prosecutor who would present a weakened brief. This court was supposed to apply the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989, which Rajiv GandhiтАЩs government had passed under pressure from Congress supporters among minority groups (Dalits, Adivasis, and Muslims). The legislation strengthened the penalties for discriminatory acts of various kinds. However, the court concluded that there was no caste angle to the crime, and so the Act did not apply. Nor did it see any grounds to consider тАЬoutrage to womenтАЩs modestyтАЭ (Victorian legalese for sexual violence). The court also ruled that the crime was not premeditated. As Dalit organizations and civil rights groups argued, all three findings flew in the face of the evidence. Although several fact-finding reports had revealed that between 40 and 60 people were involved in the assaults, only 11 faced charges. The six who were sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment by the High Court of Bombay. It is not even clear if the principal culprits were put on trial. In his analysis of the case, Teltumbde makes a number of points. The Bhotmange family had broken caste codes; they were assertive, and hence they had to be тАЬput in their place.тАЭ At each stage, there were Dalits (Mahars) present тАФ in the administration and the local police force, and among the doctors who performed and supervised the autopsies. For Teltumbde, this shows that merely having some Dalits in important posts will not address the systemic oppression and violence suffered by Dalits as a whole. IndiaтАЩs social transformation since independence had turned rural Dalits into a part of the agricultural proletariat. Violence against Dalits therefore often has a dual character, with a specific caste-based motivation and a broader class-based one, buttressed by the sense on the part of rural capitalists that Dalits in particular are deserving of such violent treatment. Lax in its handling of violence against Dalits, the Indian state is quick to deploy repression against them for dissent. The authorities frequently label Dalits and other groups тАФ notably Adivasis тАФ as Maoist or Naxalite subversives if they protest about anything, using anti-sedition laws inherited from the colonial state, along with the more recent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Arrests of Dalit activists under these laws are commonplace: many spend years in prison awaiting trial, denied access to bail, only to be released when the courts find them innocent. TeltumbdeтАЩs own arrest under the UAPA is yet another confirmation of how accurate his indictment of the Indian state is. Violence against Dalits is greatest in Narendra ModiтАЩs own state of Gujarat. The author discusses how Gujarat became the region where Hindutva forces succeeded in winning support from Dalits, despite their own aggressive casteism. But the stateтАЩs experience also shows how Dalit politics can be shaped in a different way. It is Dalits who flay and dispose of dead cattle. In July 2016, a so-called cow-protection group assaulted a Dalit family at Una because they were skinning a dead cow. Dalits, led by a young man, Jignesh Mewani, responded by boycotting this form of work, as well as the cleaning of sewers. They sought to earn their livelihoods in alternate ways by demanding land from the state government. The state government had formally allotted over 160,000 acres of land to Dalits three decades earlier, but the land was never actually handed over. The agitation led to the immediate transfer of 300 acres, which did have a positive symbolic impact. As Teltumbde reminds us, while Ambedkar himself stressed the importance of land rights, the mainstream Ambedkarite movements have not pushed for this as a route to greater emancipation. By the end of 2019, Dalits had received about three thousand acres of land тАФ slight progress, albeit at great cost. Elsewhere, the author explores the arguments put forward by a section of the Dalit middle-class intelligentsia, who depicts neoliberalism as a caste-neutral system. The Bahujan Samaj Party voted in favor of the proposal to open up IndiaтАЩs retail sector to foreign capital, which would allow companies like Walmart to enter the country. Defending this move, these intellectuals suggested that foreign investment would be beneficial for Dalit entrepreneurs, as it was not casteist. Teltumbde rebuts the claim that neoliberalism has been or will be comparatively beneficial for Dalit capitalists. He looks at sectors where Dalit capitalism is meant to have been a success, suggesting that these are simply extensions of the old, caste-based Dalit occupations. And as Teltumbde points out, the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has acknowledged that there is really no тАЬlevel playing field,тАЭ even among capitalists, by seeking to have the reservation policy applied. He compares the rhetorical function of тАЬDalit capitalismтАЭ in India to that of тАЬblack capitalismтАЭ in the United States, as a diversion from the real struggle for emancipation. Teltumbde directly confronts the attempt by Hindutva forces to co-opt Ambedkar. M. S. Golwalkar was the second of the Supreme Leaders (Sarsanghchalak) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the architect of its key theoretical ideas. When we look at GolwalkarтАЩs writings, it is easy to see how he identified Muslims, Christians, and communists as the enemy. But Golwalkar and his co-thinkers also had to bring the Dalits into the fold, in order to construct a homogeneous Hindu majority against these alleged enemies. This posed a serious problem. When Balasaheb Deoras was chief of the RSS, the groupтАЩs leaders attempted to win over Dalits. In pursuit of this goal, they put about a fable concerning the alleged friendship between the RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar and Ambedkar, and attempted to depict Ambedkar as having been hostile to Muslims and communists, and as a champion of Hindus. In response to this, Teltumbde cites AmbedkarтАЩs 1945 work, Pakistan or the Partition of India, where he wrote the following: If Hindu Raj does become a fact, it will, no doubt, be the greatest calamity for this country. No matter what the Hindus say, Hinduism is a menace to liberty, equality and fraternity. Teltumbde presents a wealth of information to show that the practice of the RSSтАУBJP is entirely at odds with AmbedkarтАЩs thinking, and utterly hostile to any notion of genuine equality with or for Dalits. He also puts forward stinging condemnations of the BJPтАЩs principal rivals, the once-dominant Indian National Congress and the recently formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He criticizes the AAP, which mobilized support on an anti-corruption platform, for refusing to face up to caste and capitalism as structural realities in India, and attacks the Congress for its historic opportunism towards Dalits. The party has treated them as vote banks, to be placated with tokenistic measures, without ever being allowed to stand on their own feet or to achieve meaningful equality. Teltumbde sharply disputes the Congress claim to have represented Dalit interests: despite decades of post-independence Congress rule, about nine Dalits in ten still lead impoverished lives as landless laborers, small-scale farmers, village artisans, slum-dwelling casual workers, and peddlers in the informal sector of the urban economy. As the author recalls, Mahatma Gandhi rejected the idea of a separate electorate for Dalits. His 1932 agreement with Ambedkar, the Poona Pact, made Dalit representation subject to the votes of their oppressors, the upper castes, through reserved seats. The Simon Commission had proposed separate electorates, which would have meant Dalit voters alone would elect the Dalit candidates. Gandhi saw this as a blow to the Hindu community and religion. Bringing nation and religion together long before the current Hindutva leaders, he went on hunger strike, demanding an end to the separate electorate for Dalits. GandhiтАЩs supporters threatened Ambedkar, warning that if their leader died, they would take revenge on people from the Depressed Class people. The result was the Pact, which Abedkar felt compelled to sign. It increased the number of Dalit seats; however, since the electorate was a common one, Dalits were mostly dependent on support from voters and parties of higher castes. This has remained the case to the present day. Republic of Caste, on a careful reading, presents the reader with a picture that differs sharply from two forms of congealed orthodoxy: the rhetoric of liberal modernization, which deems Indian-style neoliberalism to be necessary for progress, or the kind of Marxism that presents India as a semi-feudal, semi-colonial economy. Some questions remain. The most important is his critique of identity politics, and his desire that all subcastes of Dalits should be consolidated into a class. Yet Dalits are socially differentiated: as Teltumdbe himself records elsewhere, some 4 percent of the Dalits form a middle class. So who is a Dalit? The identity is actually a political project, as is the BSPтАЩs Bahujan. Secondly, after years of Dalit feminism, it is disappointing that Teltumbde does not examine the relations between class, caste, and gender, apart from his examination of repression, rape, and sexual violence. Economic and Political Weekly has published several important essays on this triad, including a dialogue between Gopal Guru, Sharmila Rege and Chhaya Datar. Overall, however, this is a careful work, which distinguishes between those the author sees as opponents within a zone of possible engagement, like the BSP and the Indian left, and those he considers forces of exploitation and oppression, namely Hindutva, the mainstream bourgeois parties, and capitalism. It should become a touchstone for discussion among radical Dalit organizations and sectors of the Marxist left. https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/07/dalit-india-ambedkar-teltumbde Kamayani Bali тАУ Mahabal тАУ A Kractivist with Multiple Personality Disorder ( MPD) which encompasses a clinical psychologist, journalist, lawyer and activist.

Eleven years after he left the Lalu Prasad Yadav-led RJD to join JD(U), Shyam Rajak, who was a minister in the Nitish Kumar government, returned to his parent party. Rajak joined RJD in the presence of Bihar's leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav. While, Rajak, a dalit leader, returning to RJD is beneficial for Yadav's party, the grand alliance is facing turbulence as former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is threatening to switch sides, once again. Another party which represents dalit interests, Chirag Paswan-led LJP, is too flexing its muscles as its leader has said it was ready to contest all seats in the state alone if it did not get a good deal from the ruling JD(U)-BJP alliance. Rajak, who served as industries minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet until he was removed from the post and sacked from the party as news of his switching sides was known, had earlier left RJD in 2009 to join JD(U). тАЬIt is an emotional homecoming for me. We had come to fight for social justice. This fight was suffering under present government. The dalits, and even the poor among the upper castes, are facing difficulties. So, I returned to continue the fight under the RJD,тАЭ Rajak said. Dalits make up for 15 per cent of the population in the state, represented by different leaders and parties. There are 38 reserved seats in the 243-seat assembly. Unlike, Uttar Pradesh where dalit politics thrived because of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati-led movements, Bihar never had dalit political agitation. Among dalits too, there are extremely marginalised groups called mahadalits. Every alliance needs to have all caste groups represented in terms of seats division to get the social engineering formula right. Manjhi, another prominent dalit leaer in the state, was part of the JD(U) before he floated his own partyтАФHindustani Awam MorchaтАФin 2015. The JD(U) and RJD had come together then. Recently, Manjhi has expressed unhappiness over accepting Tejashwi Yadav's chief ministerial candidature and instead wanted a coordination committee for elections. He has set August 20 as the new deadline for taking a decision on walking out of the alliance. It needs to be seen if he decides to join the NDA. Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan has been upping ante. He has questioned the state government on several issues, and even taken a different view from the NDA allies over holding elections and the mode of campaign. He said his party was capable of going solo on all the 243 seats. His assertions are seen as getting more seats from the ruling the NDA grouping. As elections near, the caste politics in the state is set to get intense. ЁЯУг The Week is now on Telegram.

Activists, including those from Dalit organisations and other social outfits, and opposition parties, held protests in the district and in other places in the state on Sunday against the brutal murder which happened in the Tarwan police station limits. The village head, identified as Satyameva Jayate alias Pappu Ram, was allegedly murdered by four members of the Thakur community. He was taken to a nearby tube well in the village by one of the accused, where he was allegedly shot dead by the upper-caste men, according to his family members. The gruesome incident allegedly took place on Friday night in Bansgaon village, which has close to 300 families with members belonging to Scheduled Castes. It has about 30 families each from the Thakur and Brahmin community. Munni Devi, the wife of the deceased, alleged that a man named Vivek Singh had visited their house in the evening of the murder. тАЬVivek came to our place and took my husband on a motorcycle to the tube well nearby on the pretext of a feast,тАЭ she added. тАЬLater, Vivek Singh, Suryansh Kumar Dubey, Brijendra Singh and Wasim took him to SinghтАЩs pond. Following a heated argument at the meal, PappuтАЩs friends shot him dead,тАЭ she alleged. The accused then informed PappuтАЩs family about the murder and fled the spot. Following the incident, villagers staged a protest and blocked a road. The protest eventually turned violent. An 18-year-old boy died during the demonstrations after allegedly coming under a police vehicle. The police have lodged a case against the four accused mentioned in the FIR. Azamargarh Deputy Inspector General of Police Subhash Chandra Dubey said that the police were going by the familyтАЩs claims тАЬtill the accused are arrested and questioned. It doesnтАЩt matter what the motive is,тАЭ he added. тАЬThe murder of an elected person is a very serious crime,тАЭ he said. ""All the people involved in the murder of the village head will be booked under the National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangster Act. A reward of Rs 25,000 was announced by the state government,"" the officer said. Lincoln, the nephew of Pappu Ram, claimed that there were a series of heated arguments between his uncle and upper-caste people in the village ever since he assumed the post of pradhan. тАЬMy uncle was the first person from our community to have become the pradhan of this village, and upper caste people could not digest his win. They were jealous of his stature and the fact that he walked around with his head held high,тАЭ he told NewsClick. тАЬThey murdered my uncle because Dalits raise their voice against any atrocity committed by upper-caste. We did not bow our heads before them, neither did the pradhan. They could not stand a Dalit man saying no to them,"" alleged Lincoln, adding that the accused would resort to casteist slurs against his uncle, Pappu Ram. Lincoln categorically blamed Suryansh Kumar Dubey, who, he said, had been trying to force his uncle to give him a letter confirming that he resided in the village. Dubey has five other cases pending against him, including one relating where he was charged with attempting to murder a person. According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2018, in crimes against Dalits тАУ ranging from rape, murder, violence and land-related issues тАУ Uttar Pradesh topped the list, followed by another Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state, Gujarat. The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), which has intervened in more than 80 such cases, stressed on the need to draw the attention of enforcement authorities and the judiciary on matters of discrimination and atrocities against Dalits, especially women and children. тАЬDalits have been discriminated against through social boycott and physical assault. Untouchability and physical abuse have been rampant during the pandemic. It is important to highlight that Dalit lives matter in the country,тАЭ said Dalit rights activist Paul Divakar. Speaking to NewsClick, Satish Prakash, a Dalit thinker and an associate professor of physics at Meerut University, said the state government needs to clamp down on rising atrocities against Dalits amid the COVID-19 pandemic. тАЬUttar Pradesh police have the political patronage of the state government and criminals. They roam freely after committing crimes in the knowledge that the police won't take any action against them. This is a key reason why cases against Dalits are increasing тАУ ranging from rape, murder, violence and land-related issues,"" the Dalit activist said.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

But for one 62-year-old woman, the day turned out to be another reminder of evils that have plagued the country long before the day we sent the British back home. Amrutham Amma, the president of a panchayat in Tamil Nadu was stopped from hoisting the flag at a school in her village this Independence Day, apparently by a few other upper-case Hindu panchayat members who didnтАЩt want a Dalit woman to do the important job. The panchayat president was not allowed to hoist the flag because she belongs to Scheduled Caste (SC) and a few villagers prevented her from doing the honours citing her caste. https://t.co/fBTObCqe5P тАФ Deccan Herald (@DeccanHerald) August 20, 2020  On Thursday, however, Amrutham asserted her citizenship. Surrounded by authorities, including police officers, and a few of her supporters, she finally went on to hoist the tricolour at her panchayat office. тАЬTodayтАЩs the real Independence Day for me. I have no words to describe my happiness,тАЭ she was quoted as saying after the event. On Aug 15th Athupakkam Panchayat sarpanch dalit lady Amrutham had not been allowed to hoist the tricolour. Yesterday, the District Collector & SP righted the wrong by welcoming her with a bouquet & having her unfurl the flag! She said тАЬToday is the real Independence Day for me!тАЭ pic.twitter.com/tOL0Bt8pv1 тАФ sanjoy ghose (@advsanjoy) August 21, 2020 One panchayat secretary was, meanwhile, suspended for not allowing her to hoist the flag on Independence Day. Another two men were also arrested for attacking a reporter who tried to cover the caste discrimination in the village following the incident. In later interviews, Amrutham Amma, who was elected as panchayat president last year on a seat reserved for the Scheduled Caste community, said the discrimination in her village was systemic. Apart from being denied the few kilogrammes of rice that was given out as aid, she said her family has also faced threats to their lives, while she was once asked to vacate the chair reserved for panchayat leaders in her office only for being a Dalit woman. ""From being denied the chair reserved for panchayat leaders to sit in the office, to being denied a few kgs of rice given as aid, even before her victory, the panchayat president has faced it all,"" writes Bharathi SP.https://t.co/GB0wzJtyG7 тАФ The Quint (@TheQuint) August 21, 2020  This isnтАЩt the first time she has been blocked from hoisting the tricolour either. On Republic Day this year, she told reporters that she was verbally abused when she went up on stage by the former panchayat president V Haridoss. She quickly climbed down from the podium. тАЬIt was clear from the way they looked at me that they did not want me to get on stage,тАЭ she was quoted as saying in The News Minute. If there is one story you read today, let it be about Amrutham amma and her defining image. @aadhirabharathi writes on how a Dalit woman leader asserted her right and hoisted tricolour on August 20 and her struggle started on Republic Day. https://t.co/sFIsRUJVmS тАФ Dhanya Rajendran (@dhanyarajendran) August 20, 2020  This discrimination, she said, has also stopped her from carrying out basic development projects in the village, which included monitoring the work undertaken under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Hopefully, now that action has been taken against a few authorities, Amrutham Amma will be able to continue working for the people who elected her. However, given our countryтАЩs history of caste discrimination, it may be too early to tell. Arr├й Bench The Arr├й bench delivers stories that mattress. It hasn't achieved much sofar.

"539",5042,"https://www.dalitcamera.com/assam-on-the-edge-of-disaster/","Assam: On the edge of disaster ├В┬╖ Dalit Camera","In addition to the floods and COVID-19, AssamтАЩs Mising tribe is dealing with yet another crisis after a bout of swine fever killed a majority the stateтАЩs pig population This story is the second of the three-part series by Dalit Camera, which explores how the pandemic has compounded the crisis caused by the floods in several states across India. The third and final part of the series will be out Friday, August 28. You can read the first part here. By DEEKSHITH R PAI|Bangalore|August 26, 2020 By late June, in a bid to tackle the economic crisis, India started to unlock even as the pandemic raged on. However, large parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh had a bigger battle to wage. The heavy monsoons led to floods, leaving several districts ravaged. Assam, located in the lower course of various rivers including the mighty Brahmaputra, remains severely hit. The problem has been compounded by the lack of resources due to the spread of the novel coronavirus. For the members of the Mising tribe, who form the majority of Majuli islandтАЩs population, the crisis does not end with the double whammy. The onset of the African Swine Fever since the month of February had decimated almost the entire population of pigs. A major source of livelihood for the members of the tribe, it has since led to excessive economic distress on the island. The biggest riverine island in the world situated in the Brahmaputra, Majuli is home to members of the Mising tribe, who form a majority of the islandтАЩs population. However, 43% of the Mising tribe members are categorised as Below Poverty Line. Though farming is the chief occupation of MajuliтАЩs people, rearing of pigs also significantly contributes to the islandтАЩs economy. For members of the Mising community, meat is an important part of their diet. Every household thus has pigs, either for self-consumption or to be sold in the market. In the month of February, the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, confirmed the onset of African Swine Fever (ASF) in India. As per the 2019 census, there are 21 lakh pigs in Assam with many more infected. Over 17,000 pigs are now dead, leading to the near-decimation of pigs on the island of Majuli. тАЬEvery house of a Mising tribe member in the village has pigs. But since February, the pigs in our area have been dying,тАЭ says Monoj Kutum, the village head of Sumaimari village in Majuli district. Sumaimari is located close to the river of Brahmaputra. It has a population of approximately 1,330 persons with 250 households, each of which rears pigs. тАЬIt is a big loss for our community.тАЭ With the onset of ASF, the business has suffered. As a result of the disease, restrictions were placed on meat export from Assam. Though the government tried to vaccinate the pigs, it did not yield results. The government of Assam has estimated a loss of at least Rs 30,000 per family when up to 20,000 families in all of Assam are categorised as pig rearers. With an entire source of income gone, the weight of the stateтАЩs economy has fallen on the seasonтАЩs harvest. The people of Majuli usually cultivate either mustard or urad dal in September-October, which is harvested by February. However, the lockdown in March led to a shutdown of markets and a crash in crop prices. тАЬI could not plant my Bao (an indiginous variety of rice) because of the lockdown. I lost that harvest,тАЭ rues Popi Regon, a 25-year-old Mising farmer from Majuli. тАЬI was also forced to sell the mustard at a marked down rate. Since the rains also came early this year, my fields are now flooded.тАЭ Popi is one of the many Mising farmers who have lost both their cattle and their crop to the triple-calamity. Due to the strict regulations, the people of the island were confined within their houses. Many who work as daily wage labourers were left with no work or salary. тАЬMy village is a small area. The poorer people here rely solely on labour, as there is no scope for agriculture, even for sustenance. We used to travel to the neighbouring villages of Majuli or the nearby district of Jorhat to find work as a field hand. With the lockdown, we have lost that opportunity and are struggling to survive now,тАЭ said Premadar Daw, the village head of Sengali Suti, a small village located in the interior of Majuli. A newly formed village, its census data is not yet recorded. But as per a survey by Ayang Trust, an NGO in Majuli, the village has 85 households. As the lockdown progressed and the number of coronavirus cases started increasing, there was a stricter imposition of rules on the various villages. тАЬOur village mainly consists of potters and boat makers,тАЭ explains Jugeswar Hazarika, the village head of Salmora Barbuka village. Since the start of the lockdown, they have been having a hard time. тАЬWe havenтАЩt been able to sell any of our pottery from the time of lockdown. Nobody came to make boats either because finances are a problem for everyone now,тАЭ says Hazarika. The pottery, which was kept on the roadside, lies damaged by the floods. What adds to the issue is the delay in government relief and inefficient healthcare infrastructure. While some villages got lucky, many on Majuli are struggling. тАЬWe havenтАЩt received any provisions beyond the usual 5kg rice. Nor have we received any relief kits for COVID-19 or the floods,тАЭ says Chandrama Doley, a teacher at Hummingbird School and a resident of Gajera village in Majuli. With meat consumption banned due to the ASF, many on the island are fighting for everyday survival, with only local NGOs working for their aid. The people of Majuli are used to floods and have developed coping mechanisms. Their houses, made of bamboo, are built on raised platforms. But with the floods more severe than usual this year, and movements restricted due to the lockdown, they had no choice but to watch as the waters destroyed their houses, fields and belongings. Though there has been no loss of lives reported from the island, many have been forced to seek shelter in makeshift camps along roadsides. Once the floods recede, the waterlogged areas cause many waterborne diseases, like jaundice, malaria, dengue and diarrhea. With just three hospitals on the entire island, and none capable of complications, the islanders feel isolated. The nearest multicare hospital is in Jorhat districts that can be accessed via ferries or motorised boats. While NGOs like Ayang Trust and Rural Volunteer Centre are working in the island in collaboration with the governmentтАЩs limited resources, it is not enough given the scale of crisis faced by the people of Majuli. тАЬThere is a need to make people independent, and not depend on the government or NGOs at such times. Improvements have to be brought in the sectors of farming, weaving, cattle rearing and other major livelihood sources,тАЭ says Dharamjeet Kumar, the co-founder of Ayang. Milaap Link: Ayang Trust is working towards helping the most affected families in Majuli.

Students in tribal hamlets have urged the authorities to extend the registration window for the Save-a-Year (SAY)/improvement exam for the higher secondary exam held in March. The last date for submitting the application forms without fine was on Tuesday. Many students in tribal regions were finding it difficult to comply with the deadline in view of the short window for registration given by the Directorate of Higher Secondary Education amidst the pandemic crisis, according to Adishakthi Summer School, a collective that works for the upliftment of Adivasi students. ""As per the notification issued on August 20, students have to collect the applications for SAY exam from their schools. There are several students in tribal hamlets enrolled in schools outside their home district. How can these students travel all the way to their schools in other districts to complete the registration formalities within five days in this COVID-19 situation,"" asked Mary Lidiya, coordinator of Adishakthi Summer School. The students have to submit the filled-in forms to the Principal of their school. While the students need to collect and submit the application forms at their respective schools, the Principals have the option of registering them for the SAY examination online through the official portal of the Directorate of Higher Secondary Education, according to the notification. On the short span available for completing the registration formalities, the DHSE authorities pointed out that the candidates facing such difficulties could receive the application forms from their school Principals through messaging platforms. They could fill the details and return it to the Principals concerned, they said. The lack of internet connectivity remains a major hurdle for Adivasi students, who had returned to their hamlets following the outbreak of COVID-19. Those who had registered online for Plus One admission were directed to create log-in id and password as part of the admission process. Students said they were facing difficulties in receiving the one-time password owing to the lack of mobile connectivity in their hamlets.

In the afternoon of 14th August, the girl went to defecate in a nearby farmland in the Pakaria village of Isanagar area, located at a distance of 130 km from Lucknow. The police have arrested the two accused of the case. The girl had gone missing after she went to relieve herself. Her family started searching for her when she didnтАЩt get back home. They finally found her body in a sugarcane field. It was confirmed later in her postmortem report that she was raped and died of strangulation. The girlтАЩs father stated that her eyes were gouged out, tongue was cut. The UP police, however, affirmed that her postmortem report didnтАЩt show her eyes gouged out or tongue cut. Satyendra Kumar, Superintendent, Kheri district, stated, тАЬHer eyes were not gouged out and tongue was not cut. The claim is not true. There is nothing in the postmortem report to suggest this. There were scratches near the eyes, likely due to the sharp sugarcane leaves, where the body was found.тАЭ The police have filed charges against the two accused of rape, murder and also under the National Security Act. The farmland where the girl went for defecation belonged to one of the accused. He had reportedly warned the girlтАЩs family in the past against defecating in his farmland. Opposition parties including the SP and BSP have started questioning the Adityanath government over the increasing number of crimes in the recent days.

Published: 30th August 2020 08:55 AM | Last Updated: 30th August 2020 08:55 AM | A+A A- Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha addressing a news conference in Vizag. (Photo | Express) VISAKHAPATNAM: Even before the heat generated by the tonsuring case in East Godavari district died down, yet another such incident was reported in Visakhapatnam. However, the city police acted with alacrity and arrested seven persons involved in the incident. Speaking to mediapersons here on Saturday, Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha said following a complaint lodged by the victim P Srikanth, the police investigated the case and arrested the accused, including the wife of Big Boss (Telugu) fame Nutan Naidu. He said they seized the footage of CCTV camera in the house and based on the evidence, cases under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and other Sections of the IPC were filed against the accused. The police arrested Nutan NaiduтАЩs wife N Priya Madhuri, T Indira Rani (26), housekeeping supervisor, Ch Varahalu (35), supervisor, I Ravi Kumar (26), a barber, S Balagangadhar (29), M Jhansi (19) and M Sowjanya (29), staff at Nutan NaiduтАЩs house, on charges of assaulting and tonsuring the 20-year-old Dalit youth. The CCTV footage reportedly revealed that the accused thrashed and tonsured Srikanth. The Police Commissioner said Srikanth worked as a housekeeping boy at Nutan NaiduтАЩs house for six months till he quit the job on August 1. On August 27, Varahalu asked him to come to the house. When Srikanth went to the house, Priya Madhuri allegedly accused him of stealing her iPhone. Srikanth, who refuted the charge, came back from the house. However, Varahalu again asked him to come to the house on Friday. Srikanth was allegedly abused and thrashed by some of the inmates and staff with sticks and steel rods. Later, the accused called Ravi Kumar, who tonsured Srikanth. They allegedly threatened him not to reveal the incident to anyone. After tonsuring Srikanth, a few of the accused reportedly took selfies with him and later they deleted them. However, their mobile phones were seized by the police and the deleted data was retrieved. The police registered cases under Sections of attempt to murder (307), voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons (324), and various other Sections, including 342, 324, 323, 506 r/w 34 of IPC and 3(1)(e) and 3(2)(v) of the SC, ST Act. Manish Kumar Sinha said further investigation into the case would reveal if there was any other intention in attacking Srikanth. Narrating his harrowing experience, Srikanth said he was targeted and beaten up as he quit the job in their house. He said they refused to listen to his pleas that he did not steal the mobile phone as alleged. He said he left the house 28 days ago and was not aware of the mobile and denied that he had scanned the photos of Indira. Based on his complaint, Pendurthi police acted swiftly in the tonsuring case, the Police Commissioner said. O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

Published: 27th August 2020 09:11 AM | Last Updated: 27th August 2020 09:11 AM | A+A A- Former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu (Photo | PTI) VIJAYAWADA: TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu has appealed to the Director-General of Police (DGP) to order a high-level inquiry to nab the persons responsible for the suicide of Dalit youth Om Pratap in Chittoor district. In a letter to the DGP on Wednesday, Naidu stressed the immediate need to check the call lists of Om PratapтАЩs phone to find out who issued life threats to him before he took the extreme step. тАЬIt was because of the ruling YSRC leadersтАЩ threats over wide circulation of a video on the social media that the Dalit youth ended his life,тАЭ he alleged. The TDP chief said it was saddening to witness the spurt in attacks on Dalits under the present government. тАЬIt was equally disheartening to see the police inaction on one hand and a section of police are conniving with the ruling YSRC leaders to attack, harass and threaten Dalits on the other. As a result, the attacks on Dalits are continuing unabated,тАЩтАЩ he alleged. тАЬOm Prathap used to earn his livelihood by driving an auto rickshaw in Madanapalle town. Prathap has recorded his frustration with the YSRC government on a video and the same was circulated widely across Telugu people,тАЭ Naidu mentioned in the letter.The TDP chief said that the ruling party leaders in general and Punganur MLA and Minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy in particular have reportedly made many threat calls to Om Prathap. тАЬHence, it is essential to probe the call list of the deceased,тАЭ he demanded.

As the education minister of Maharashtra, she has also had to oversee the transition in education during Covid. Photo credits: Free Press Journal As an ardent Phule-Ambedkarite, and one of the 3 Dalit women MLAs in the Maharashtra state legislative assembly, she believes it is important to pave opportunities for women from marginalised communities and vest them with diverse ministerial portfolios. In a conversation with Women for Politics and Behan Box, Varsha Gaikwad talks about her journey as a Dalit woman in politics, and how the work of Babasaheb Ambedkar and Savitribai Phule has inspired her work as a politician. This is part of a new series titled тАЬWomen, Power and PoliticsтАЭ, where we bring to you conversations with radical and progressive women leaders from across the world. The first edition of the series features women political leaders from the South Asia region.  Tell us about your background, childhood and entry into politics.  I belong to the Dalit Magasvasrgiya community in Maharashtra and grew up with great financial difficulties, living in a big joint family. I am a first-generation learner in my family who studied beyond the 10th grade and attended college and university. I have a Masters degree in mathematics and also a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed). I was into academics before I entered politics. Considering my background, I feel fortunate to be in politics.  From what I remember, even as a 12-year-old, I wanted to join politics. I used to go around Dharavi with my father, who was the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) and saw the immense goodwill he enjoyed among the people there. We were brought up amidst the ideology of Babasaheb Ambedkar, Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule and Mahatma Jotiba Phule. I was taught to fight for justice and equality must continue in their footsteps, no matter what our professions were. As ardent believers in their ideologies, it was only natural that I saw politics as a platform for rewriting social justice as envisaged by them.  I am a living example of the anti-Brahmanical patriarchal ideologies of Shahu-Ambedkar-Phule. My parents did not follow the usual tradition of pushing their sons to carry forward their political legacy. I remember that before the state assembly elections in 2004, my brother and I both went to the party office to be interviewed for tickets. The Congress party chose me. So, I believe, apart from my parents, I appreciate the faith the party, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, put in a Dalit woman candidate.  I was only 27 when I was first elected an MLA for Dharavi in 2004. I remember so many asking me тАЬBut why politics? You are so well educatedтАЭ. My answer then and it is now is that just as you cannot measure the depth of the ocean while sitting by the shore, you need to be part of the system to be able to change it.  You talk so passionately about the Phule-Ambedkar ideology that you are such an ardent believer and follower of. How have those ideals guided you in your politics and policymaking?  Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule started the first school for girls along with Fathima Begum in Pune in 1848. The regressive society pelted stones at them but they carried on with their mission in the face of all sorts of attacks. Her students achieved a great deal like Mukta Salve who became a writer.   The Phule couple adopted a child at a time when it was not the norm to do so. Not only that, but they also offered shelter and care for young kids, of widows and single women who were left destitute by society. They made provisions for water and food and more importantly respect and dignity for women, especially Dalit women.  These are the values that guide me in my work too. When I was the Women and Child welfare minister in 2014, I spoke to a lot of single women, especially sex workers directly - this I believe is important: hearing from people directly.  I visited places like Kamathipura with higher populations of sex workers, and they told me that they faced problems when school admission forms for their children asked for the fatherтАЩs name and they could not provide this. They told that their kids were ridiculed or bullied. One of the first policies I made was to make the fatherтАЩs name optional on the forms.  Similarly, I met a lot of transgender persons and they mentioned they faced a lot of difficulty in accessing welfare schemes and lack of recognition. We make policies for them but do not ensure simple things like documentation for them to be able to access that. I made policies on ration card access.  From Babasaheb, who is my idol, I learnt the principle of liberty, equality and fraternity - the basic ideals of our constitution. My heart aches when I see those basic values of the constitution being trampled upon today. As the education minister, I made the reading of the preamble of the Constitution mandatory in school assembly sessions and also explain it to children especially the values of equality and scientific temper.  What I learnt from all the three icons is the steadfastness of belief and the dedication and work needed to realise them. Savitribai even died serving people during the plague where she was helping her son Dr. Yashwant.  Elected women representatives are few in number. Dalit women are even fewer. What institutional barriers do Dalit women face and what can institutions do to increase their political participation?  You are absolutely right. In Maharashtra assembly, there are just 24 women MLAs, of which only 3 are Dalit women. For Dalit women, it is difficult to get elected repeatedly. This is why I argue for at least 50% quota for women in Parliament and state legislative assemblies.  Women are at an advantage as they can connect and communicate better with their women constituents. But getting more Dalit women into politics needs support from society and the political parties who have to give them tickets.   Secondly, women need to be given more diverse ministerial portfolios. Why do we get only Women and child welfare, social justice or tribal affairs ministries? If Babasaheb Ambedkar can write the constitution of this nation, then why can I not be the education minister.   As Dalit women, we have to prove ourselves over and over again to gain recognition and acceptance. I may be here because of reservation but I have also worked hard for it. Otherwise, I would not have been elected four times. I had a lot of support from society, my parents and my constituency and, the party that supports me, gave me a ticket and promoted me.  My fatherтАЩs words, when I came into politics, ring in my ears even today.  He told me тАЬ Always think hard before you speak because we have a big name to uphold. And that is Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.тАЭ So whatever I do, is to only glorify his name.  A few months ago, Maharashtra MLA NamitaтАЩs decision to attend the Assembly session in her 8th month of pregnancy made it to the headlines. There are incidents around the world where women politicians are reported to have been asked more questions about their household responsibilities. So, if you are being questioned in the same manner what will be your response to this and what are your thoughts about such questions?  If someone asks me this question, I will definitely say that we cannot leave behind our family as the family is our backbone however I am proud to be an ambitious woman. Men in politics are not questioned about their background but woman are. We have built a different perception for women politicians. A woman can too have ambitions, be it politics or other careers, and men should support them. If a wife can support her husband in his career, then why should my husband not support the wife in her career aspirations. Society needs to move away from patriarchy if it needs to be a progressive one. What is that one thing you would like to change for women in politics?  I feel more doors should be open for women at every level in politics. We need more progressive thought about women in politics. If we will give more opportunity to women, we will get to see more women in politics. I do not intend to demean the role of men in politics. However, somewhere we need to understand that for a man when 50% women can vote than for a woman 50% men can vote too.  What would you like men to know for becoming allies of women in politics?  Be supportive, be cooperative! I feel the view about women in politics is changing. This time in the Maharashtra cabinet, there are 24 women representatives.  If everyone will start thinking like Jyotiba Phule and work towards supporting the women in the family, society progressive towards gender equality.   Education is instrumental in building aspirations and empowering people. If you want to encourage women in politics how do you think education can play that role in filling that gap?  Yes, I feel education gives the wings to aspiration. Education expands oneтАЩs knowledge and clears oneтАЩs vision. I say this, as an educated woman myself.  This is a huge progress in empowering women decision makers, that has happened because of education.  I see that many women and girls are motivated to study and become independent today. To join politics, knowledge of law and politics is of great importance.  I believe there are two kinds of learnings in politics - the theoretical learnings and the experience learnings. I have had different learnings from both education and experience respectively.  As Baba has quoted тАУ тАЬKnowledge is the PowerтАЭ. Education definitely broadens oneтАЩs perspective and helps one in building their ideology and vision for life.  What message would you like to give to other women who aspire to join politics in Maharashtra? How would you like to support such women?  People have a misconception that politics is a dirty place, it is a false perception. Politicians are also people, just like you. We are no different. In fact, we meet more people, get more exposure and understand peopleтАЩs problems better. The first time I met transgenders, I was hesitant. But once I started eating with them and understanding them, I got comfortable.  Understand the ground realities of people and equip yourself with public speaking skills and knowledge about administration, governance and policy. Politics is the best field because it gives you a solid platform to help others, help people in getting justice, make welfare policies and more. You can help someone get a pension, get a job and improve someoneтАЩs life.  I agree, there is a lot of struggle in this field. But you can overcome that difficulty by focusing on your work and staying motivated. I urge all the women regardless of their caste and background to come forward and join politics. I feel so happy when I meet young women who want to join politics and are passionate about it. I feel delighted by the way they carry themselves, their confidence and their progress.

"552",5145,"https://countercurrents.org/2020/08/criminalization-of-dalit-thought-and-action/","Criminalization of Dalit Thought and Action | Countercurrents"," Assertion of Dalits and consciousness that began flowering in the second half of twentieth century was not to create submissive Dalits to any force of oppression. Its intention was very clear. Dalits said out loud that they had enough. They declared out loud that from then on, they would fight for their rights, dignity, history, culture, power and property. The monopoly on the resources, thought and action that was maintained from the Vedic times to the 19th century had to face the challenge from the Dalits who for such a long time endured the life of nothingness. Time for Dalits has begun. Nobody can stop. Nothing remains unchallenged forever. So is the slavery of Dalits and domination of the upper caste over their thought and life. Prior to nineteenth century, there were Sudras/Dalit who lost their lives in the process of fighting their rights. But from nineteenth century, coming of the missionaries and the European colonizers have directly and indirectly assisted Dalits to fight for self-liberation from the restriction on thought. Liberated mind produces reasoned thought and that would produce organized action. Pre-modern Dalits who were made to believe that he/she ought not think, limited their natural rationality for generating survival knowledge, producing culture of their own and for producing technics of production of their own. But he/she made sure that such a thought would not get in conflict with the laid out social norms or entered into the sphere of knowledge that is reserved for the upper caste. In other words, Dalits were forced to be ignorant and innocent by the ManuтАЩs restriction on thought till nineteenth century, despite their knowledge production on material production and their independent culture proved that they are second to none in cultivation of thought. In other words, Manu made sure that Sambukhas and Ekalavayas would not pose threat to the monopoly of the Brahmins over knowledge. But after the external progressive elements liberated Dalit mind from ManuтАЩs restrictions, the Dalit mind simultaneously focused on thought and action. Both went together. Their thought targeted superstructures of discrimination and their actions provided physicality to their thought in the form of challenging and breaking oppressive traditions and building a fresh. This brought Dalits with direct conflict with upper caste who began to sense the dangers of relationship between Dalit thought and action. Scared of public acceptance of Dalit thought and action as they both are reasoned, the upper caste began to criminalize both as the anti-religion, anti-culture and anti-social. How dare are you to think the unthinkable, how dare are you to question the unquestionable, how dare are you to challenge the unchallengeable and how dare are you to do the undoable. This is still the inner voice of the upper caste who for reasons of civilizational standards not able to say it out loud. From thought to the action, the chronology of challenging the hegemony troubles the upper caste. To counter this, at various levels, counter measures are generated based the context. If it is village, even submissive Dalits would be remined of their limits. Even accidental тАШviolationтАЩ of the caste norms would not be forgiven. Moreover, it would be seen as an opportunity to remind Dalits of the position and guarantee that they would remain so in future too. The rural India uses violence, threats, boycott (socio-economic and cultural), blocking flow of essential material and the traditional justice delivery institution like panchayat to keep Dalits in control. Here, thought of Dalits would not be trouble for the upper caste/caste Hindus because Dalits engage with thought within the restricted caste norms. However, during last four decades, the rural Dalits are getting networked with the semi-urban and the urban Dalit platforms of promoting consciousness, fighting for justice, dissemination of Ambedkar thought, resisting discrimination and fighting for natural rights is on the rise so is the backlash. As a result, we are seeing the emergence of the rural and semi-urban networks of Dalit organizations and association by the Dalits working as teachers in schools, colleges, government offices and retired employees. The last category though in their sixties are quite active and providing visibility through their gatherings, discussions and participation in justice seeking protests so on. This network of Dalit educated and employed connecting the victims of caste violence of the rural India with urban IndiaтАЩs Dalit educated-activist-intelligentsia network. So, the semi-urban conscious Dalits, in the last four decades have emerged into not just as the network of dissemination of thought of Dalit ideologues of the past centuries but they also began to understand systems of discrimination at individual and community level and such an understanding resulting in the generation of narratives and interpretation of discrimination, building the means, methods and culture of protest, developing alternative culture and making efforts to write their history to build identities and arguments to fight for justices. If Dalits are liberated from the restrictions of the thought, first conscious Dalit could focus on understanding structures of discrimination. At this stage, the upper caste/caste Hindus would find problem with the thought process of Dalits as long as it is not translated into discourse, debate and physical action. In fact, many uneducated Dalits in rural India would have the ability of understanding the politics of discrimination/oppression. That is to say that they being uneducated caste minority in the rural India does not stop them from thinking about how they ended up becoming untouchables, poor, powerless and dependent on the upper caste. Apart from this, some of their elderтАЩs memory of caste oppression and repercussions they a result of young Dalits immediate responses to upper caste/caste Hindu atrocities also a thought process that calls for reasoned response. The тАШmaturedтАЩ Dalit elders of the village always controls the radical thought process of the young educated Dalits to reduce physical attacks and caste animosity. For the elders, caste system, their social position, their role in the culture of the village and their parallel existence is normalized life as they and their ancestors lived such a life. However, the young educated away from the elders of the villages, in colleges, universities and other institution of education employment are independent to some extent and also comes under the influence of the learned urban Dalit intellectual New Sites of Thought and Action Reservations in education and employment from 1950s, allowed young Dalits to shift into a new site which earlier dominated by the upper caste alone. Unlike their village and semi-urban forms of violence, discrimination and humiliation, Dalits would come across an environment that is completely new but in course of time, they realize that the sophisticated forms of discrimination and humiliation are worse than villages. At these two different spheres, government employees organize themselves into organizations and associations to fight against injustice in the hands of the upper caste colleagues placed above them and educated in the colleges and universities organize themselves too to address immediate concerns and, most importantly, they sharpen the thought process as they study caste, religion, social reforms, economy and politics in the universities. Despite being in different spheres as educated and employed, their common identity, of course, bring them together and share experience with each other. While the Dalit employees share their experience with the intellectual Dalit, the later would theories the experience of the earlier. They reciprocate with each other in this fashion. The emergence of Dalit intellectuals, in considerable numbers, after perhaps two decades of the implementation of reservations, becoming a challenge for upper caste monopoly of thought, knowledge and structures of power. Dalit educated organizing and Dalit intellectual acquiring the ability of theorization are in fact problematic to the hegemonic structures in the long run. Phule, Savitri, Fathima, Sahoo Maharaj, Ambedkar, Ayyankali, Nangeli, Ayothee Thass during colonial times have done primary but considerable damage to the foundations of oppressive caste, social norms and religion. Most of what was expected by ideological fathers from the new generation of Dalit intellectuals was not only began to be fulfilled but also, they are growing as mass and continuity in theorization of the life of Dalits is suffocating the upper caste. This would generate an anger that cannot be publicly displayed in physical actions or also cannot be translated into a verbal tirade. It is in this context, the upper caste uses their prowess to generate sophisticated methods of humiliation, discrimination, domination and monopoly. Since they still have hold on power, politics, educational institutions, law and order, legislative, executive and judicial spheres, media and property, their efforts of evolving sophisticated forms of discrimination would not face any blocks. In fact, they all, in different spheres of power, work together as members of a тАШsecret societyтАЩ to reciprocate with each other. When the degree of Dalit consciousness is bearable, the upper caste would adopt the attitude of the wait and watch along with sophisticated methods of discrimination and suppression. If the degree of Dalit consciousness is higher and unbearable that targets the foundations of Hinduism and caste, then the upper caste invokes all its channels to work against Dalits. This reaction from upper caste acquires aggression and in urban sphere and violent attacks on Dalits in the rural sphere. The upper caste sets limits for the reaction of Dalits to their discrimination and humiliation. They have to react and respond within those limits. In the process of criticizing the discriminative structures, Dalits intellectuals are allowed to point out or тАШattackтАЩ (critical of) the peripheral or residual imperfections in the Hindu religion. However, from 19th century to today, the slow progression in the degree of Dalit consciousness break those limitations and responds aggressively as intellectuals as well as justice seekers. Dalit intellectuals, apart from producing knowledge on Dalit history, politics and culture, they would also participate in the justice movements. The young Dalit educated, apart from getting education, they, with assistance and guidance of the Dalit intellectuals agitate for justice. In both cases, thought and action goes together. This engagement between thought and action, naturally expand and would eventually annihilate the caste and dump the religion. If eighteen percentage of people part of Hinduism breaks away from caste and religion, it would cause irreparable damage to the foundations of the both. It was this concern which was called as Gandhian Paranoia stopped breaking of Dalits away from Hindu religion. His hypocritical anti-untouchability campaign convinced some Dalit leaders of colonial times to trust him. But Ambedkar was not to fall into his plans. Continuation of his legacy by the Ambedkarits has been putting pressure on the custodians of the culture and religion who would never lose their social positions, culture, religion and history would do all that they can to stop the spread of Dalit consciousness. The upper caste has resources and means to counter the growing consciousness as anti-social, anti-culture, anti-state, anti-nation, destructive and so on. Those who involve in developing these narratives to present consciousness Dalit as some of sort of criminal knew that they are doing it on purpose despite knowing that such a criminalization is unfair and the so called social, state and nation are still unfairly remaining anti-Dalit. Dalits are still not part of the Hindu social. It is the Hindu social that dominates the state and nation. Therefore, obviously for the upper caste, the submissive Dalit is unproblematic and conscious Dalit is criminal. Dalit intellectual, by nature, would be aggressive and radical in their reaction to the atrocities and discrimination. But the Hindu social and state (political Hindu) would want Dalits to locate their anger and response within in the frame that is acceptable for the upper caste or at the most in Gandhian non-violent frame. In the earlier, the victim seeks justice from the culprit. Here, Dalit has to take what is given. In the latter, the victim has to beg for justice by not angering the upper caste and troubling the society. Given the monopoly of the upper case over these two, Dalits have already come to a conclusion that both these methods do not work. But using other methods would brand Dalits as criminals. Yet, Dalits seems to have no option but to adopt Phule-Ambedkar-Periyar radicality in their intellectual traditions and тАШbreak-burn-dumpтАЩ in activism. Ironically, the upper caste people intentionally not only blind themselves to see how they have been nurturing the age-old anti-Dalit socio-religious-cultural criminality but also shamelessly involve in developing more dangerous methods discrimination which could be done by lumpen intellectual criminals. To camouflage their criminality, using the support of the state and its institutions, they make efforts to criminalize Dalit intellectuality and activism. Unfortunately, India as a nation, from the day it born, is under the control of the cultural majority and it started deciding the future of the nation. Congress at the helm of the affairs was not doing enough either in controlling casteist forces or in controlling cultural majority. For the religious and caste majority, dominating and discriminating the caste and religious minority became a birth right. Unity in diversity has always been a hypocritical formula to camouflage the real color of the cultural/caste majority. Hindus have always remained dominant. Earlier Dalit mobilizations have already challenged the domination and exposed the hypocrisy Compared to the earlier, the current mobilization is much stronger, wider and witnessing the participation of large-scale Dalits. It is also getting the support of Marxist parties and organizations and the support of the religious minority like Muslims. Neel (Dalit) -Lal (Marxist) -Green (Muslim) emerged as caste-class-religious progressive solidarity formulation to counter the onslaught of the radical right-wing on Dalits, Muslims, and ideological minorities. However, the Dalit mobilization alone has acquired pan-Indianness. The current according Christophe Jeffrelot, current mobilization of Dalits is simultaneously happening in various states. Increased percentage of educated Dalits contributed to this pan-Indianness. However, one could observe a visible gap between the North, South and North East. Dalits across regions have commonality in suffering but they do not have a common language communicate. Even if the regional leaders speak to people of particular region in their own language, Dalit educated, intellectuals, political leaders, lawyers and activists must adopt English as the langue for connecting Dalits. Dalits failing to take English language as means of communication is a biggest hurdle to pan-Indianness of Dalit movements. Victimhood is promoting Dalitness and Dalitality. Yet, if there is a common language that can bridge the gap across the regions. Dalit intellectuals in colleges-universities-research institutions-NGOs-independent scholars-literary personalities forms into a formidable intellectual community that is capable of theorizing Dalit experience, creating witness on atrocities on Dalits, producing counter narratives and writing fresh histories and leading successful movements of justice. This, some time, was dependent on the upper caste progressive elements but now seeking independence from them too, it declares that it had reached vantage point. Therefore, they argue that they do not need the non-Dalit intellectual to theories Dalit experience and write their histories. They oppose the appropriation of Ambedkar and Dalit studies which is commonly called as colonization of Ambedkar. Since the educated would also organize and agitate, for Dalit intellectuals, it becomes natural to do all the three together. Not all of them, of course. There are typical careerist Dalit educated who think like an upper caste and start criminalizing the educated-organized-agitated Dalits. They maintain a visible distance from the so-called troublesome Dalits who are not serious about studies. Ironically, they take the side of the upper caste in the institutional set up who believe in the concept that educational institutions as sacred temples of learning and their pristine holiness needs to be maintained. Such an тАШunconcerned and submissive Dalit educatedтАЩ though less in number, their parallel existence works against the conscious Dalit and demoralizes them in their fight against discrimination and fight for justice. They are mainly drawn from urban and very less from rural. However, their submissiveness would not go waste. They would quickly climb up on the ladder of career as they are not considered problematic. But the conscious Dalit would get into troubles almost immediately. In colleges and universities, Dalit intellectuals and students apart from questioning the discriminative policies and strategies of administration, they extend their criticism to larger policies of the government. Questioning is natural right in democratic country. But the people holding control of these power structures still believe that they are rulers of the caste empires (institutions and government) and the Dalits are showing the courage of questioning the unquestionable. Out of such an anger, the custodians of caste empires, given their access to power, generate methods of criminalizing both the thought and action of Dalits The Bhim Koregaon Episode Bhim Koregoan is site of pride, dignity, valor and action that offers an opportunity to Dalits say out loud that they are second to none in courage and valor. Perhaps, there were such episodes in the history of pre-modern as well as colonial India. Not much of it was written. When identity of the nation is built on the exclusive histories instead of the composite, Dalits who have already realized that their history is entangled in myths, marginalized and wiped out by the religious, casteist and elite historians, they would make every to effort to liberate their history from myths, bring it from margins into mainstream and restore the wiped out afresh by retrieving every minute piece of evidence for their history. After the victory of British East India CompanyтАЩs Mahar contingent of around 800 soldiers against around 20, 000 Maratha Peshwa army near Pune on January 1, 1818 at Koregoan, Maharastra, British built memorial, Phule brought the incident into history, Ambedkar visited in 1927 and turned into site of celebration of Mahar valor and history and from then on Dalits are annually celebrating it as such. As long the Mahar history was not read as victory against Marathas, the Koregoan memorial was not seen problem. But the raise of Brahminic Hindutva that builds not only itтАЩs identity as a superior community but also wish to form the base of the identity of the nation on its history and culture. With such an agenda, it creates history and culture. Any opposition to its promotion and propagation would be viewed seriously. Positioning the Bhim Koregoan history, memorial and its commemoration against Brahmins ruler and nation/nationalism is a conspiracy to criminalize the history of Dalits. However, the present Koregoan case where most of the serious Dalit and progressive non-Dalit intellectualsтАЩ part of the 200 years commemoration of Koregoan victory on 1st January 2018 cannot be seen as single and unconnected incident. The anti-Dalit anger was building up from justice for Rohit movement in 2016. Increasing presence of Bhim Army, Jignesh MevaniтАЩs Una movement, Celebration of Mahisasur in JNU against Dussera and the spread of Asura celebration in North-West-East tribal areas and general anti-RSS-BJP discourse by Dalit intelligentsia have all contributed to criminalize the Bhim Koregoan and its history. Of course, the sheer size of the event that could be read as the mood of conscious Dalits sent shock waves to the upper caste. The increasing presence of Dalits in social sciences and literature and proliferation in publishing houses focusing on the history of Dalits and culture, increasing counter to the dominant intellectuals, production of counter narratives which are posing threat to the hitherto dominated upper caste narratives on religion, history and culture, immediate justice seeking reaction to the atrocities and discrimination of Dalits and also increasing levels of consciousness among Dalits that is resulting in the development of mass organizations such as Bhim Army have been troubling the upper caste dreaming to establish Hindu Rastra for some time. Celebrating Ravana against Ram, Narakasura against Sathaybhama and Mahisasura against Durga Devi is an organized counter by Dalits-Bahujan-Adivasis to a culture that is bound to be same for everyone. The Dalit Bahujan audacity of rejecting Ram and celebrating Ravan would not only pose danger to a package of Hindu culture that remained popular for so long but also exposes the upper caste literary, social and cultural criminality that destroyed and marginalized the history of pre-Aryan Nagas and Dravidians. In fact, a counter narrative to mythological texts is already underway which is troubling them. If the counter acquires continuity, the age-old culture would collapse and criminality would be exposed. It has to be stopped. This is what explains the criminalization of the Koregaon and Dalit leaders and intellectualsтАЩ part of it. Creating, countering and celebrating history of Dalits is not new for Dalits. But itтАЩs intensification causing discomfort. As long as Dalits remain passive consumers of history, it would not be problem. Ahistory of Aryans is historicised and the history of historical Naga/Dravidians is mythicized. Liberating the history from the myth allows Naga/Dravaidian Moolvasis and Dalits an opportunity to build their historical identity. Their thought would focus on theorizing Dalit experience and building historical and cultural identities and their action apart from focusing on questioning and challenging the superstructures of discrimination, also contributes to the process of creating democratic, scientific, rational and humanistic traditions which would treat everyone equally. Therefore, neither their thought nor their actions have any element of criminality. Their thought and action would eventually lead to the creation of just society. Dr. Y.

Published: 03rd August 2020 11:02 AM | Last Updated: 03rd August 2020 11:02 AM | A+A A- Representational image (Photo| Twitter/ @KTRTRS) KHAMMAM: IN yet another incident that highlights the obstacles faced by marginalised groups in getting their voices heard, the sarpanch of Konaigudem village - a Dalit woman - has been struggling to complete the construction of a proposed Vaikunta Dhamam in her locality for the past few months. According to sources, the TRS sarpanch, Pentamalla Pullamma, and other village officials took up the construction of a Vaikunta Dhamam, dumpyard and compost shed in a half-acre land allotted in Konaigudem around seven months ago, as part of the Palle Pragathi programme. On receiving a patta for the said land from mandal revenue officials, the village authorities initiated the works of the Vaikunta Dhamam at an estimated Rs 13 lakh and the compost shed at Rs 2.5 lakh, under the NREG Scheme. The works were nearing completion and the officials were about to lay the roof of the Vaikunta Dhamam, when a few persons obstructed the construction, claiming that the land belonged to them. Though Pullamma and the village secretary showed them the patta they had received for the land, the group was not willing to hear the officials out. The dispute over the ownership of the said land has been going on since then. Pullamma had even approached the Nelakondapalli police station to file a plaint. However, it went in vain. Speaking to Express, Pullamma said: ""We approached the Nelakondapalli police station twice and filed laints. However, there has not been any response till now. We further met MLA Kandala Upender Reddy and informed him about the situation. He promised he would look into the matter and take steps to resolve it, but we have not heard from him since then. We then met the District Collector and filed a plaint. However, the Collector also turned a blind eye to the matter."" A desperate Pullamma further said: ""It is very unfortunate that even an elected representative of the ruling party has to run around offices to get something done. However, I am not ready to give up. I will fight till justice is served and our village gets a proper Vaikunta Dhamam."" O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

Prabhakar speaking to news persons on the issue of Dalits in Hyderabad on Saturday. | Photo Credit: By Arrangement Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) legislators have decried the Opposition parties for trying to brand the party government in the State as anti-Dalit although the government has been supporting both Dalit and tribal communities in their efforts to scale the Mount Everest. Talking to newspersons here on Saturday, party legislators Balka Suman, Kale Yadaiah, Guvvala Balaraju and M.S. Prabhakar criticised the Opposition parties for running a misinformation campaign against the TRS party and government. They stated that the welfare schemes being implemented for Dalits in Telangana were not being implemented in any other State in the country. Stating that the Dalit candidates who contested the last Assembly elections on TRS tickets had won with huge majorities, they said it proved that the community was strongly behind the party. They were given tickets even in general seats too. The TRS government had also introduced reservation for Dalits in agriculture market committees, they noted. However, unable to digest such a massive support of Dalits to the government, the Opposition parties were trying to attribute the incidents of killing of Dalits to the ruling party. They reminded the Opposition leaders that the incidents of Chundur and Karamchedu were still fresh in the memory of Dalits although they took place decades ago. The TRS legislators suggested the Congress and BJP leaders to look into the atrocities being committed on Dalit and tribal communities in the States ruled by them. On the incident in Gajwel constituency, the TRS leaders said the government did not resume the land of the Dalit farmer there for construction of Rythu Vedika and B. Narsimhlu who had ended his life had participated in the ground-breaking ceremony of the Rythu Vedika. In fact, it was the previous Congress government that had resumed the DalitsтАЩ land for construction of a sub-station there. They alleged that the Congress leaders living in Hyderabad were trying to spread COVID in the name of visiting districts without any valid reason.

Well researched and informative, but readable and accessible, this is a book for those interested in sociological studies as much as for the lay reader.  An excerpt from Christina DhanrajтАЩs essay, Swipe me Left, IтАЩm Dalit, from the book: There is also a steady stream of discourse dedicated to how Indian women are gaining sexual agency, in that they are no longer hesitant when it comes to casual sex, being with married men, or having an open relationship. Hook-ups and casual dating, via an app or otherwise, are perceived to be creating a sex-positive culture for Indian women who may otherwise be inhibited from experiencing unbridled sexual pleasure inside or outside of a relationship. Unsurprisingly, this mainstream feminist discourse is predominantly led by women from upper-caste/bourgeoise locations. Not all Dalit women (cisgender, heterosexual, urban, and educated), who consider dating as a possible route to finding romantic partners, necessarily share the same experience. At the heart of a good, intimate relationship is the understanding that those involved, in sustaining that bond, are of value. But, how is this value determined and who in the relationship determines it? The highest value, as defined by Hinduism, has traditionally been ascribed to the Brahmin woman, followed by the Kshatriya, the Vaishya, and the Shudra. The modern-day ideal is also a savarna or a savarna-passing woman, who is typically light-skinned and able-bodied, belonging to a family that has the monetary and social capital, and embodying qualities considered to be feminine. The farther one is from this ideal, the more undervalued she is perceived to be. Within relationships, this perception, albeit external, translates into an unhealthy power imbalance, leading to a potential compromising of oneтАЩs rights, desires, and authenticity. Dalit women who carry the double burden of gender and caste, and are one of the most socially undervalued in India, are therefore under constant pressure to project an acceptable version that mimics the savarna ideal. In a romantic pursuit or a partnership, we are expected to operate along with a behavioural band that is far narrower than what is required of a non-Dalit woman. Needless to say, the existence of this ever-present mandate to be something one is not, so as to constantly prove oneтАЩs value or romantic potential, even in the most personal of spaces that is ideally supposed to feel like home, is unfair at best and cruel at worst. And the price that is asked of us, in return for a semblance of normalcy, is our safety, dignity, and mental health. While I do not know of every Dalit womanтАЩs experience, I can say (based on mine and that of my friends/ acquaintances) that dating in India overall is nowhere close to the rosy picture characterized by the absence of caste or the prominence of female sexual agency. Dalit women are repeatedly stereotyped as: Not only does this make us seem unattractive, especially in the context of dating where confidence is generally regarded as an attractive trait, but it also has further implications in an actual romantic or sexual relationship. Because it is assumed that we do not have the power to protect ourselves, our bodies and our labour are grossly undervalued. Intimate violence may follow, whose magnitude is further aggravated by a real (or perceived) lack of monetary and social support in the case of underprivileged Dalit women. While traditional discourses, most often authored by savarna voices, have concluded that we face intimate violence only at the hands of Dalit men (which in turn has led to the unfair criminalizing of Dalit men and boys), our lived realities today speak of another truth. Non-Dalit male partners are far more likely to inflict violence on us both physically and sexually, for the reason that they face far less legal and social consequences when reported. Even in the case of Dalit male protagonists, the one who catches his eye or steals his heart is most often not a Dalit woman (Sairat, Thalapathy, Kadhal), who, when represented, is often depicted as loud-mouthed, angry, and verbally abusive in the real world, this translates into an angry Dalit woman stereotype, which lacks femininity and therefore cannot evoke the feeling of romantic love in a heteronormative sexual setting. Particularly in the case of a politicized Dalit woman who is active on social media and the digital space, this stereotype is repeatedly used against her in an effort to invalidate her political critiques. The mere voicing of her opinions and the vocalizing of her lived experiences invites a barrage of accusations from both Dalits and non-Dalits. If such a woman does succeed in finding a heterosexual romantic partner, she is expected to maintain certain behaviours so as to sustain the relationship. These include subscribing to the ideals of a traditional wife/girlfriend, finding ways to integrate herself into the partnerтАЩs social circle, and leaving her тАШidentity politicsтАЩ outside the door. Thus, in most cis-hetero relationships, the price paid by a Dalit woman (stereotyped as angry and unfeminine) towards its success is far higher than that required of a non-Dalit woman. The latter can retain her political self and still be perceived as feminine, while the former will have to keep proving her femininity by choosing to not voice her political opinions, which are typically deemed as irrational. Voicing of these opinions, either publicly or privately, means the potential end to a relationship. TodayтАЩs urban Dalit woman navigating the modern dating/matrimonial space is not spared this stereotyping. What the sexually liberated non-Dalit woman does and articulates is accepted as a credible political response, while what the Dalit woman does is perceived as shameful. Casual sex, being with married men, and having open relationships, which are touted as sexually liberating and indicative of a sex-positive culture, does not hold the same meaning for Dalit women. Particularly in the case of men having savarna women as partners, their interest in Dalit women outside of the legitimate relationship is only an urban/modern version of upper-caste men sexually exploiting disadvantaged Dalit women that work in their fields/houses. In most cases, the savarna partner is not threatened by this arrangement; she continues to be the legitimate entity in the equation while the Dalit woman is relegated to the task of satisfying the manтАЩs unconventional sexual desires.

The police inspector was suspended after a video clip of his purportedly kicking and abusing a Dalit man went viral. Director General of Police DG Sawang placed Kasibugga inspector Venugopal under suspension and ordered an inquiry into the incident. This is the third such incident in the last fortnight where some police personnel were found behaving allegedly in a high-handed manner. In all these cases Dalit men were at the receiving end. The first incident happened in Rajamahendravaram, where a Dalit man had his head tonsured and was beaten up allegedly by the police. The second occasion was at Chirala where a Dalit man died after local police allegedly beat him up. Former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu tweeted the Srikakulam video clip. He alleged that the ruling YSR Congress men were behind the incident. However, the DGP responded saying тАШthere is no involvement of any political party as allegedтАЩ. See video: https://twitter.com/ncbn/status/1290871786708451329 The Srikakulam district SP Amit Bardar visited the Dalit man Marri JaganтАЩs house and enquired about the incident. Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) Dharmana Krishna Das, who hails from the district, condemned the inspectorтАЩs high-handed behaviour. He asserted that the government was committed to the protection of Dalits. The minister informed that the Visakhapatnam Range Deputy IGP has been asked to conduct an inquiry and submit a report. It all happened when Jagan went to lodge a complaint against an attack on him by some YSRC men. The assault came after Jagan questioned them over the house-sites issue. The video footage shows the inspector standing outside the Tekkali town police station when Jagan approaches with his mother. As Jagan is speaking, the inspector is seen kicking and also beating him. A video was later circulated in which Jagan claims there was nothing wrong with the inspector. It was he himself who spoke in a rash tone. тАЬThe inspector chided me for speaking in such a tone. He was so courteous towards me. He made me sit inside the police station and gave me lunch. He cautioned me against getting into any tussle with others,тАЭ Jagan is purportedly heard saying, even as someone is heard prompting certain words. In the video, JaganтАЩs mother claimed the inspector treated her like a mother and тАШhe looked like my sonтАЩ.   Enter your email to get our daily news in your inbox.

Her body was found in a sugarcane field on Saturday. Two men from her village have been arrested. The incident reportedly took place on Friday in a village close to the Nepal border. Her body was found in the fields of one of the accused. The district police chief Satyendra Kumar said, ""The girl's post mortem has confirmed rape. The two accused had been arrested already. We will file charges for rape, murder and also book them under the National Security Act."" Meanwhile, the Lakhimpur Kheri police have now denied that the 13-year-old girl, who was raped and strangulated on Friday, was further brutalized when her eyes were gouged out and her tongue cut off. Lakhimpur Kheri SP Satendra Kumar said there was nothing in the post-mortem report that would suggest that the 13-year-old's eyes were gouged out or tongue was cut. ""There were scratches near her eyes which could be due to the sugarcane leaves. Her tongue was not cut,"" the SP said. He said that the girl's post-mortem report has confirmed sexual assault and strangulation. However, the police said, the post-mortem report did not suggest that the victim's eyes were gouged out or tongue was cut. SP Satendra Kumar said that the police have registered a case of murder and gangrape against the two accused. The two accused will also be charged under the National Security Act. The victim's father had said his daughter had been strangled. Her eyes had been gouged out and her tongue was cut, he had alleged. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said, in a tweet, that crime against women had reached an all-time high. He said that the brutal murder and rape of a minor was enough to shake humanity. рдЙрдкреНрд░ рдХреЗ рд▓рдЦреАрдордкреБрд░ рдЦреАрд░реА рдореЗрдВ рдПрдХ рдмреЗрдмрд╕ рдХрд┐рд╢реЛрд░реА рд╕реЗ рджреБрд╖реНрдХрд░реНрдо рдХреЗ рдмрд╛рдж рдирд┐рд░реНрдордо рд╣рддреНрдпрд╛ рдЗрдВрд╕рд╛рдирд┐рдпрдд рдХреЛ рдЭрдХрдЭреЛрд░ рджреЗрдиреЗ рд╡рд╛рд▓реА рдШрдЯрдирд╛ рд╣реИ. рднрд╛рдЬрдкрд╛рдХрд╛рд▓ рдореЗрдВ рдЙрдкреНрд░ рдХреА рдмрдЪреНрдЪрд┐рдпреЛрдВ рд╡ рдирд╛рд░рд┐рдпреЛрдВ рдХрд╛ рдЙрддреНрдкреАрдбрд╝рди рдЪрд░рдо рдкрд░ рд╣реИ. рдмрд▓рд╛рддреНрдХрд╛рд░, рдЕрдкрд╣рд░рдг, рдЕрдкрд░рд╛рдз рд╡ рд╣рддреНрдпрд╛рдУрдВ рдХреЗ рдорд╛рдорд▓реЗ рдореЗрдВ рднрд╛рдЬрдкрд╛ рд╕рд░рдХрд╛рд░ рдкреНрд░рд╢реНрд░рдпрдХрд╛рд░реА рдХреНрдпреЛрдВ рдмрди рд░рд╣реА рд╣реИ? #NoMoreBJP тАФ Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) August 16, 2020  Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati condemned the incident on Twitter calling it 'extremely shameful'.

"569",5276,"https://kractivist.org/remembering-annabhau-sathe-the-dalit-writer-who-dealt-a-blow-to-class-and-caste-slavery/","Remembering Annabhau Sathe, The Dalit Writer Who Dealt A Blow To Class and Caste Slavery - Kractivism","The postage stamp issued in Annabhau Sathe's memory by the department of Posts on 1 August 2002. If Dalit literature is gaining the imagination of the public today, much of the credit goes to one person, Annabhau Sathe, whom other Dalit writers have acknowledged as the тАШfounder of Dalit literatureтАЩ. Dalit literature mostly emerged from the lived experiencesтАФfight for survival, casteist abuse incurred, and revolt against inequalityтАФof marginalised communities and craves for equality while rejecting age-old customs and exploitation. It gives voice to the voiceless and exploited groups in a casteist society. Powerful condemnation and brutal attack on caste and class differences are the main themes of Dalit literature, which mostly is inspired from AmbedkarтАЩs ideology and philosophy. Tukaram Bhaurao Sathe, popularly known as Annabhau Sathe, was born in the Dalit community (Matang) on 1 August 1920 in Wategaon village in the Sangli district of Maharashtra. Poverty and caste discrimination stopped him from getting any formal education and forced his family to move to Mumbai in 1931, where he worked in various jobs such as porter, shoe polisher and daily wage labourer, before finally ending up as a mill worker. While working in the textile mill, he got attracted to the Communist ideology. His 35 novels, 10 folk dramas, 24 short stories, 10 powadas (ballads), one play and a travelogue have been published in Marathi by the Maharashtra government in 1998 and many more remain unpublished. Brahminical control over art has ignored Dalit art and culture. American writer Eleanor Zelliot, in her book тА▓From Untouchable to Dalit: Essays on the Ambedkar MovementтАЩ, notes that various art forms such as Tamasha (loknatya), Powada (Ballads), Lavani (combination of traditional song and dance), and Jalsa were unquestionably produced by low castes, but [kept] anonymous and never considered respectable. He founded Lal Bavta Kalapathak (Red Flag Performing Troupe) in 1944 along with Shahir Amar Shaikh and Shahir D. N. Gavankar and became a full-time propagator of the communist party. Annabhau SatheтАЩs fascination with communism is evident from his travelogue, Maza Russiacha Pravas (My Journey to Russia), that he wrote on his visit to the Soviet Union in 1961 as representative of Indo-Soviet Cultural Society. It tries to show how anti-USSR propaganda is misleading. Before his travel to USSR, some of his works were already translated to Russian, Czech, Polish and German languages such as тАШStalingradche PowadaтАЩ (Ballad of Stalingrad, throwing light on labor issues and dedicated to workersтАЩ struggle), so he was well-received in the USSR. His travelogue is attributed as the first travelogue by a Dalit (Ambedkar had travelled to many countries and wrote letters but those were not published in the form of a book). SatheтАЩs writings contributed toward creating class consciousness among workers in society. In another ballad, тАЩMumbaicha Girani KamgarтАЩ (Mill Worker of Mumbai) written in 1949, Sathe traces the miseries of factory workers and captures the disparities between the rich and poor in Mumbai. There are divine looking high-rise buildings on Malabar hills, Indrapuri There is a colony of Kuber, rich people enjoy all material comforts. On the contrary, people living in Parel Work hard day and night, eating whatever they get and sweat it out. Coming from a poor background and experiencing the realities of life, he wrote on day-to-day realities, class/caste struggle and social interactions. His writing skills, sharp voice and mastery over various musical tools such as harmonium, tabla, drum, and bulbul made him a shining star on the streets. He was a unique combination of Marxism and Ambedkarism, who analyzed class and caste struggles in his writings and wrote in praise to Lenin and Ambedkar. In the early 1950s, when then home minister Morarji Desai banned Tamasha (mainly because these were used by Communists party against Congress), he defied such oppression and changed Tamasha to Loknatya (public play) which achieved great fame. His protagonists in the award-winning novel тАШFakiraтАЩ (1959) not only reclaim their identity but also teach humanity and the value of forgiveness тАУ a path towards much needed communal harmony in our times. Fakira (the titular character) depicts the reality of Dalits, living on the margins, and being exploited and suppressed not only by British rulers but upper castes. Fakira emerges as a Robin Hood while looting grain from British stores and distributing it to starving people. Morally upright and ready to sacrifice his life for principles, Fakria believed that it is an absurdity that people are starving while food is rotting in a rich manтАЩs house. He would rather die fighting than dying meekly тАУ тАШI desire to live and die like a lionтАЩ. This is what we still see in a society that while thousands of tonnes of food rot in тАШgodownsтАЩ, people starve to death. On IndiaтАЩs independence, Annabhau Sathe said, тАШthis freedom is fake, when people of the country are starvingтАЩ. After winning the state award in 1961 for his тАЩFakiraтАЩ, he dedicated it to Ambedkar. Annabhau SatheтАЩs novels had women protagonists as well, such as in тАШChitraтАЩ, characters who fought against British and challenged patriarchy. Annabhau inaugurated the first Dalit Sahitya Sammelan (Dalit Literary Conference) held on 2 March 1958 at the Bengali School auditorium, Mumbai. In his speech, he said these popular words, тАЬthe old belief that the Earth rests on the head of Sheshnag is untrue. It finds its balance on the palms of toiling Dalits and workers.тАЭ He also reminded Dalit writers of the responsibility that they have: тАЬDalit writers are entailed with the responsibility of liberating and shielding Dalits from the existing worldly and Hindu tortures as the long-standing conventional beliefs cannot be destroyed instantlyтАЭ. AnnabhauтАЩs poetry mirrors the anguish, helplessness and pitiful life of lower classes and lower castes in the society and gives a call to oppressed classes and Dalits тАШto break the chains of class and casteтАЩ, taking inspiration from Ambedkar. In his poem тАЩTake a hammer to change the worldтАЩ, Annabhau calls for unity to fight against the tyranny and envisions a society without exploitation, almost on the similar lines as Saint Ravidas envisaged in his couplet тАШBegumpuraтАЩ almost 600 years ago. Take a hammer to change the world So saying went Bhimrao! Why the elephant is stuck sitting In the mud of slavery? Shake your body and come out, Take a leap to the forefront! The rich have exploited us without end The priests have tortured us As if had eaten jewels And thieves had become great Sitting on the chariot of unity Let us go forward To break the chains of class and caste Hold to the name of Bhim! (Annabhau Sathe Samagra Vagnmay, 1998) Though he remains unacknowledged, SatheтАЩs work played a vital role in IndiaтАЩs labour as well as freedom movement, creating awareness about labour rights and issues. He actively engaged in тАШSamyukt Maharashtra MovementтАЩ (United Maharashtra Movement) and composed the much-quoted and compelling song тАЩMajhi Maina Gawawar RahiliтА▓ (My Maina Got Left Behind in the Village). тАШMainaтАЩ, the beloved, became the symbol of the separation of Maharashtra from Mumbai, convincing masses to see Mumbai as an integral part of Maharashtra. My maina is left behind in the village my heart yearns for her. (Annabhau Sathe Samagra Vagnmay, 1998) He also wrote, Mazee Mumbai Arhat Mumbai Konchi? (My Mumbai means whose Mumbai?) during Samyukt Maharashtra movement highlighting problems of migration and issues of unemployment. In the story Smashanatil Sone (Gold From The Grave), Annabhau Sathe describes the pain of a Dalit man, Bheema, who comes from a small village and, unable to find a job in Mumbai, starts digging graves at midnight to find gold buried with the corpses. Sorrow, anger, rejection, poverty, unemployment, rebelling to get freedom from the shackles of class and traditions and circumstances that lead people to do unconventional jobs are common imagery in AnnabhauтАЩs writings. Present-day Communists ignore him due to his caste and Ambedkarites disregard him for his inclination towards Communism. To ignore any of this side would be an injustice to his legacy. His poetic genius cannot be matched by anyone. There was no poet like him, there is none and there will be none like him. He was truly a legend beyond imagination. While the Communist Party published works of most of its members, Annabhau SatheтАЩs work was hardly published (or published depending on the political agenda of the party) by them. Ignored by society and government, Annabhau Sathe died on 18 July 1968 in dire poverty and remains marginalized within mainstream literary opinion.

Caste hierarchies and deeply entrenched inequalities in the domain of Indian society depict the most disturbing truth wherein despite over seven decades of independence, we continue to nurture a social fabric that discriminates and exploits people on the basis of their caste affiliations. This truth became even more apparent when forty Dalit families in the Kantio Kateni village of Odisha were asked to leave and village and go after they were subjected to more than two weeks of boycott after a Dalit girl from the community was caught plucking flowers from the garden of an upper caste family. For having plucked flowers from the garden of an upper caste family not only the little girl and her family, but more than 40 households of the Dalits were humiliated and assaulted for over two weeks and they were also asked to leave the village. This led to a sustained conflict between the upper and lower castes in the village and as a result the upper castes boycotted over 40 Dalit families. The girl who had allegedly picked up flowers from the garden of an upper caste resident of the village is reported to have immediately apologised so that they matter could be resolved on the spot but after a series of meetings, it was decided that all the Dalit families living in the village will be boycotted and it was also decided that they would no longer be allowed to participate in any social event of the village. The village has a total of 800 families and 40 households belonging to the SC Naik community. As part of the social boycott that is being sustained against these 40 families, milk and grocery stores in the village have stopped selling their items to them and everybody outside the caste fold has stopped talking to them. The upper castes have also ensured that the lower castes are not given any work in the village and are compelled to move out of the village in search of work. They have also been warned against taking out processions related to funerals and marriages and their children have been denied the right to study in the government school in the premises of the village. The police have said that even if after the conduction of several meetings between the elders of both the communities matters are not resolved, they will be completed to register an FIR.

A division bench headed by Justice L. Narasimha Reddy observed that the prosecution failed to produce sufficient evidence before the court, and noted that the accused have already spent a long time in jail. The high court pronounced its judgment on a petition by the convicts who challenged the special court's order in what is known as Tsundur massacre case. The court directed Guntur district superintendent of police to make adequate security measures and ensure that no procession or celebration is organised after the convicts are released. In 2007, a special court sentenced 21 to life imprisonment and 35 others to one year's rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.2,000 each, convicting them for the massacre. The court set up under the SC/STs Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, held 56 people guilty but acquitted 123 others for lack of evidence. Eight Dalits were killed and many others injured in attacks allegedly by upper caste people on Aug 6, 1991 at Tsundur village of Guntur district, about 350 km from Hyderabad. The houses of Dalits were looted and set afire and many families were forced to flee from Tsundur and adjoining villages. The police filed a charge sheet against 219 people, of whom 33 died during the course of the trial and seven were let off as police did not find any evidence against them. The case was heard over nearly 16 years in the country's first-ever special court set up at the scene of an atrocity. Guntur superintendent of police Satyanarayana said the high court order would be challenged in the Supreme Court. Several Dalit organisations have also reacted strongly to the high court order. They plan to challenge the high court order in the apex court. Click here for IndiaToday.inтАЩs complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

The district administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.       Meanwhile, the SHO of Lalganj police station has been suspended for unlawful detention.  A departmental inquiry has also been ordered by the Superintendent of Police (SP), Swapnil Mamgain, into the incident.

As his condition deteriorated, Mohit was taken to the district hospital where he was declared dead.  The body has been sent for post-mortem.  The SP told reporters, ""We have received a complaint from the family members of the deceased in which they have alleged torture and accused two sub-inspectors (SI).

The officer was suspended following the death of a Dalit youth who was detained for not wearing a facemask. Yericharla Kiran was detained for not wearing a mask and helmet on July 18 along with his friend, Shini Abraham.

While being transported to the police station by sub-inspector Vijay Kumar, police say, Kiran attempted to flee and sustained a head injury in the process. He was first admitted to Chirala government hospital and later at a private hospital but passed away two days later. His family had alleged that the police officers are responsible and it was a case of custodial death. Vijay Kumar was issued a suspension order on July 28 and arrested on August 1.

"582",5459,"https://thefinancialdaily.com/dalit-representation-in-sa-must-for-socio-economic-uplift/","Dalit representation in SA must for socio-economic uplift | The Financial Daily","ISLAMABAD: Distinct and considered political representation of Dalits in South Asian countries is a prerequisite for their socio-economic uplift. This was the unanimous viewpoint of social scientists and scholars from Pakistan, India and the UK, mostly representing the Dalit or scheduled classes of the Subcontinent, who were speaking at a webinar organized by Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), here Saturday. The first-of-its-kind dialogue, titled тАШSouth Asia, Neo-Communal Settings and Implications for Social DemocracyтАЩ connected Dalit scholars across political boundaries to understand and discuss the conditions, deprivations and reservations of the scheduled castes in South Asia, especially Pakistan and India, while trying to identify a way forward for their elevation. The panelists included Prof Meena Dhanda from University of Wolverhampton; Prof Dr Sumeet Mhaskar from Jindal Global University; Prof Amit Thorat from Jawaharlal Nehru University; Dr Abhay Kumar, Indian scholar and journalist; Asif Aqeel, a journalist and researcher from PakistanтАЩs Christian-Dalit community; Faqir Shiva Kachhi, president, Darawat Ittehad; Sarwan Kumar Bheel Advocate, a social activist from Tharparkar; Heba Ahmed, research scholar, Centre for Political Studies, JNU; Dr Sunaina Arya, JNU research fellow and editor of Dalit Feminist Theory: A Reader. From IPSтАЩ research faculty Dr Shahzad Iqbal Sham, Sufi Ghulam Hussain, Nadeem Farhat Gilani, and Agha Noor Muhammad Pathan participated in the discussion, while the session was chaired by Khalid Rahman, the InstituteтАЩs executive president. Dalit speakers from Pakistan said the upper caste Hindus were a small minority and they cannot represent the Dalits who were in a majority. They said the upper castes continue to ignore the issues of the scheduled castes and hence should not be seen as their representatives. The situation in India was no different where Lok Sabha too hardly featured any representatives from the scheduled castes although they constituted a major share of the population. The speakers were unanimous that scheduled caste Dalits did not enjoy their due share of representation at any level. They said the Dalits were constantly being deprived of education, employment and socio-economic opportunities whereas their rights were being violated. Aqeel was of the view that the Dalit Christians in Pakistan have been linked with menial jobs as part of their caste, which was hampering them in pursuing socio-economic uplift. Mhaskar pointed out that things were not very different in India, as the structures of exclusion generated from the Brahminism and spread across South Asia. He said caste was a big concern that permeated into every domain and created many issues. He said there was a long list of exclusionist areas including education, jobs, scholarships and representations that need to be analyzed. The Prevention of Atrocities Act was enacted in India in 1989 however it has not been able to fully address these issues. He added that there were provisions to compensate for the deprivation of scheduled castes in Indian constitution but firstly they are not well-implemented, secondly they are applicable only for civil services which constitute just 4-6 percent of the jobs in India. On the other hand, these deprivations are still largely prevalent in the private sector. He also drew some parallels between the conditions and issues faced by Muslims and Dalits in India. Abhay Kumar reflected as how caste-based discrimination is labelled as inter-religious issues under a politically-motivated campaign of Islamophobia. He said under this trend the term Islamophobia was not only directed at the Muslim religion but also the society. Heba stressed that the burden of being an exclusionist minority had increased manifold in India with the introduction of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. She said the Indian government had a poor track record of dealing with its minorities, and CAA was just another example manifesting the fact. She said Muslims in India face mass state discrimination every day of their lives. Heba was of the opinion that persecution of minorities in India or Pakistan had a domino effect in the other country. Arya said societies in South Asia were historically divided on the basis of privileges and deprivations. Extending the feminist view of Dalits in India, she presented an example of a case where a Dalit woman was gang raped but the court ruled out the possibility of her being raped as the identification of rape was done on the basis of a personтАЩs consent or its absence. In this case the victim was Dalit and hence did not have the тАШagencyтАЩ to refuse or reject. The judgement, according to the speaker, institutionalized the scheduled caste deprivation in a new way. She said it was necessary that lower caste people should attain positions of authority so that their voice could be heard. Thorat viewed that the caste system in South Asia was prevalent for thousands of years and the mindset cannot change in a mere 70 years after the adoption of the Indian constitution. He said there were provisions in the constitution to address these issues and if they were implemented in letter and spirit, the Dalits and other scheduled castes, which should rather be seen as free slaves, would not have been in the position they were in now. The historic wrong of the society must be corrected, he added. Log in to leave a comment","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

A Dalit lawyer and activist in GujaratтАЩs Kutch district was on Friday killed by a man from Mumbai, allegedly over his social media posts criticising Brahminism, The Indian Express reported. The accused and five other suspects were arrested on Saturday. The lawyer, Devji Maheshwari, was a senior member of the Indian Legal Professionals Association and the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation. An unidentified Crime Branch official in Mumbai told the newspaper that the accused, identified only as Raval, had threatened Maheshwari in the past too. They both belonged to Rapar town in Kutch. тАЬMaheshwari wrote and shared posts critical of Brahminism on his Facebook page,тАЭ the official said. тАЬRaval disagreed with those views and warned Maheshwari on several occasions to refrain from writing such posts publicly.тАЭ MaheshwariтАЩs last post on Facebook post was a video of Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation National President Waman Meshram saying that members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes were not Hindus. The police said that the accused, who works at a stationary shop in MumbaiтАЩs Malad suburb, travelled to Rapar on Wednesday. CCTV footage of the incident on Friday showed Raval following Maheshwari into his office building and running out just seconds later. He was stabbed to death, according to The Hindu. The accused was charged for murder and criminal conspiracy and under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. He was arrested by a team of the Gujarat Police. The police named nine other people in the first information report too and arrested five of them. The others are still missing. The lawyerтАЩs killing sparked tensions in Rapar town as members of the Dalit community demanded action against the suspects. MaheshwariтАЩs family named nine suspects and refused to accept his body till all of them were arrested. Inspector General of Police (Border Range) J R Mothaliya said that the motive behind the murder is yet to be established.

The vicious cycle of violence perpetuated at police stations is more pronounced for Dalit survivors who face the double burden of discrimination on the basis of gender and caste. The report, titled тАЬBarriers in Accessing JusticeтАЭ, is a joint effort of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) and the Association for Advocacy and Legal Initiatives (AALI). It documents the experiences and challenges of women survivors due to non-registration of cases of sexual offences by the police. Fourteen survivors and nine caseworkers were interviewed from 2019 to 2020 for the study from seven districts - Aligarh, Amroha, Auraiya, Lucknow, Jhansi, Jaunpur, and Muzaffarnagar. None of the 14 cases saw an FIR being registered immediately after the survivor reported the crime at the police station. Out of these, an FIR was registered only in 11 cases, but police personnel took between two to 228 days to do so. In two cases, the survivor and her family had to compromise under pressure and no FIR was registered. In the third case, the FIR was registered with the main offence as sexual harassment and not rape as alleged by the complainant. The delay in registering an FIR often resulted in women survivors being repeatedly assaulted by their perpetrators. In all the 14 cases, the police disbelieved survivor testimonies, scrutinised the allegations and demanded тАЬevidenceтАЭ from the women or their families even at the first stage of reporting the crime. Deep prejudice among police personnel about women often result in survivors and their families being insulted, the study records. As a result, when a survivor in Aligarh alleged that her husbandтАЩs friend raped her in her home in May, 2017, her written complaint was not accepted and no action was taken. When she returned after 15 days following more assaults from her perpetrator, the chowki in-charge of the rank of sub-inspector remarked, тАЬYou arenтАЩt even beautiful that someone will trouble you, you arenтАЩt even a young girl that someone will sexually assault youтАЭ. It took the police 181 days to file an FIR despite appeals made to the SSP, the DM and the State Women's Commission. Also read: Hathras gang rape victim dies in Delhi hospital On June 5, when a Dalit survivor in Lucknow visited the local police station a day after she was raped in an agricultural field, an SHO of the rank of Inspector told her, тАЬyou are poor, you shouldnтАЩt pursue this case, and you are getting a false case registered so the case wonтАЩt be registeredтАЭ. She was then asked to return home. In the same city, another Dalit survivor alleged that her brother-in-law raped her at a hotel in December 2017. She was told, тАЬyou are doing it for money, thatтАЩs why you want to register a false caseтАЭ. You are coming here with a fake case, women make up such casesтАЭ. The police took 117 days to register an FIR. On December 10, 2017, a Dalit survivor was kidnapped and gang-raped in Jaunpur. She escaped after six days and when she and her father visited the police station, they had to wait for тАЬ2-3тАЭ days to meet the SHO, who took no action. A month later, the family got an order from the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court asking the police to register a case. Yet the SHO refused to comply. He remarked, тАЬearlier you were making your daughter solicit, and now you are coming here to file a complaintтАЭ. The police ultimately took 40 days to file an FIR. The report also notes that often the police тАЬmount pressure and intimidate them to look for solutions outside the legal system.

Security has been beefed up outside the Safdarjung Hospital where the Congress and Bhim Army activists are staging a protest over the gang-rape of the woman. Meanwhile, members of the Delhi Mahila Congress also staged a protest at Vijay Chowk demanding justice for the victim. Congress Rajya Sabha member P L Punia and former MP Udit Raj also joined the protest which was led by Delhi Mahila Congress president Amrita Dhawan. The victim was initially admitted to a district hospital 15 days ago with her tongue cut off and spinal cord severely injured, among other serious injuries. She was later shifted to Aligarh hospital for treatment, before moving to Safdarjung Hospital in the national capital. The police said the victim had been dragged into a field and gangraped. She had also been strangled with her dupatta. Four upper caste men of the womanтАЩs village in Hathras district, who were charged with gangrape and attempt to murder, apart from charges under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, have been arrested. They were arrested based on a statement provided by the victim on September 23, when she briefly regained consciousness. She had accused three men тАУ Sandeep, his uncle Ravi (35) and their friend Luv Kush, of committing the crime. The victimтАЩs mother, who had gone with her to a field nearby to cut grass for their cows before the incident took place, had told The Indian Express, тАЬI was sitting 100 metres from her. I could have saved her. I wish I wasnтАЩt hard of hearing.тАЭ The family alleged the main accused, Sandeep, and his family had тАЬalways harassed Dalits in their areaтАЭ.

According to police, both Maheshwari and Raval had clashed repeatedly over the past one month where the latter had warned Maheshwari regarding his social media posts.

The gang rape and killing of the woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system has sparked outrage across the country with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying on the streets. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri) NEW DELHI -- The gang rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system sparked outrage across the country on Wednesday, with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying in the streets. The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district. The woman's family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Tuesday, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar Pradesh's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, тАЬStop rape culture.тАЭ Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic Women's Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the тАЬrape state of India.тАЭ тАЬWe do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,тАЭ Mullah said. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits - formerly known as тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ and at the bottom of India's unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy - are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence. Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court. In the latest case, questions were raised over a hasty cremation, with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights. The woman was cremated early Wednesday, with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home. Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as тАЬabusive and unjust.тАЭ In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime. In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged. Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts. According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 - an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children.

Don't miss out on the latest News Bijay Kumar Minj, New Delhi Updated: September 08, 2020 03:43 AM GMT Dalit Christians, activists and civil society protest in New Delhi on Dec. 4, 2018, demanding that the Indian government give them the same rights as enjoyed by their Hindu counterparts. (Photo: Bijay Kumar Minj/UCA News)  Dalit Catholic leaders across India have threatened to start a new church if their demand to end casteism and discrimination against Dalits in the Catholic Church is not met. Around 30 speakers and 150 participants attended a virtual meeting on Sept. 5 organized by six Dalit Christian organizations from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. тАЬIf the Vatican does not immediately remove the discriminatory process of bishop selection that neglects qualified Dalit priests, we could announce our own Indian Dalit Catholic Church or the Indian Dalit Catholic Rite,тАЭ Franklin Caesar Thomas, coordinator of the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC), told UCA News. тАЬThe new church will separate Dalit Catholic Christians from the Indian Catholic Church's casteist leadership.тАЭ During the virtual meeting, Dalit leaders appealed to the Catholic Church, the apostolic nuncio to India and Pope Francis to curb the visible and invisible untouchability practices that exist in the selection of bishops. They said that none of IndiaтАЩs four cardinals and 31 archbishops have a Dalit background. Similarly, among 188 bishops, only 11 are from the Dalit community. In caste-ridden Tamil Nadu, only one of 18 bishops is from a Dalit background. Dalits, formerly untouchables, are the lowest caste within Hindu society. Huge numbers of Dalits have converted to Christianity and Islam over the decades, though the religions offer limited protection from societal prejudice. The word Dalit means ""trampled upon"" in Sanskrit and refers to all groups once considered untouchable and outside the four-tier Hindu caste system. Government data shows 201 million of IndiaтАЩs 1.2 billion people belong to this socially deprived group. Some 60 percent of India's 25 million Christians are of Dalit or tribal origin. Vincent Manoharan, national convener of National Dalit Christian Watch (NDCW), told UCA News that years of protests by the Dalit Christian community had not brought any positive changes. He said protest marches are planned near the nuncioтАЩs office and the headquarters of the Catholic BishopsтАЩ Conference of India (CBCI). тАЬDalit Christians are fighting for their respective place in the Church as well as fighting in the Supreme Court for their scheduled caste status in society,тАЭ Manoharan said. тАЬFrom now onwards we will have national and international conventions to press our demand to end casteism and discrimination against Dalits in the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, our brethren are suffering in both the Church and society. тАЬWe are also planning to send our representative to the Vatican, United Nations and the European Union so that we can build a pressure group at international level.тАЭ Can't read the image? click here to refresh.

The Dalit woman was abducted on Monday while she was travelling with her mother in a tempo. The incident took place at Raya Road which comes under the Sadabad police station in Hathras. The woman and her mother had come to Sadabad to buy medicines and were returning home in a tempo in the evening. During the journey, the woman felt sick and started vomiting. As a result, her mother stepped down from the tempo to fetch her some water. Taking the opportunity, the tempo driver and two other men decided to abduct the woman. They sped away in the vehicle with the woman, leaving the mother behind. The mother raised an alarm and informed her relatives, who rushed to the spot and called the police. Based on the complaint lodged by the woman's family, the police filed a case of abduction against the driver and two others. The police started its probe based on CCTV footage from a petrol pump in the region where the tempo was captured. The woman was later found based on the CCTV footage. The incident of abduction comes as a 19-year-old Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh's Hathras died at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on Tuesday morning, days after she was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men.

"605",5620,"https://www.newsclick.in/over-half-prisoners-india-are-muslims-dalits-and-adivasis","Over Half of Prisoners in India are Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS In a chilling indictment of the prevailing social system, a recently released government report on prison statistics revealed that just over half of all convicts and undertrials in India prisons are Muslims or dalits or adivasis. The share of these three communities in IndiaтАЩs population is 39.4%, according to the last Census held in 2011. But the proportion of prisoners from these communities is 50.8%. These three communities are the most economically and socially backward ones in India. Literacy rates are lower, school and higher education access is more limited, poverty rates are higher, unemployment is higher and average landholding sizes are lesser than other communities in society. Besides this, they also are subject to social oppression, violence and discrimination by the so called тАШupper castesтАЩ. In the case of dalits and adivasis, this social oppression has been a centuries- old legacy. For the Muslim community, the recent rise of Sangh Parivar affiliated outfits тАУ both in the form of Bharatiya Janata Party-led governments at the Centre and several States, and in various organisations active тАУ has created a new era of vicious hate mongering and violence. This combination of economic and social backwardness, and discrimination is responsible for the higher rates of imprisonment in Indian jails. This is reminiscent of the condition of Black (African-American) community in the US, which makes up about 13% of the countryтАЩs population yet suffers an unconscionably high imprisonment rate of 40%, according to the latest data of the US government. As seen in the table below, Muslim prisoners made up 18.1% of all the prisoners (convicts and undertrials) in India. This is more than the proportion of Muslims in IndiaтАЩs population, which was 14.2%, as per Census 2011. In the case of dalits (Scheduled Castes or SCs), the gap is even bigger.  While the share of dalits in IndiaтАЩs population is 16.6%, they make up 21.2% of the prisoners. Similarly, adivasis (Scheduled Tribes or STs) make up 8.6% of the countryтАЩs population but in prisons, their share is 11.5%. Analysis of earlier years suggests that this skew has always existed, despite all the claims of social justice, equality before law and тАЬsabka saath, sabka vikasтАЭ (development for all) by successive governments. It is a feature of IndiaтАЩs unequal and discriminatory socio-economic system, and not a mere aberration. Disempowered Sections of Society There are several factors at work in creating this shocking state of affairs. First and foremost is the fact that persons belonging to these communities are mostly poor. This prevents them getting access to proper legal advice right from the time of police investigation up to the proceedings in courts. Their disadvantaged position prevents them from exercising such basic legal rights as getting copies of police or court documents and verifying that authentic information is being recorded, getting representation of lawyers who are well versed and skilled enough to negotiate the maze of judicial proceedings, applying for bail or parole, petitioning to higher appellate bodies, etc. In this, not only is their poverty an obstacle but also the widely prevalent bias displayed by police and often by courts against them. When those who should be acting fairly and impartially start displaying such communal and casteist biases against Muslims or dalits and adivasis, little justice is expected. In Indian prisons, about 30% of the inmates are convicts and about 69% are undertrials, according to the National Crime Records Bureau report, Prison Statistics of India 2019. The remaining 1% is detenus or other types of prisoners. The vast number of undertrials is mostly those people who could not post bail because of not having enough resources. Obviously then, the poorest people get trapped in jails because of their poverty. Among them are large proportions of these three communities. State GovernmentsтАЩ Role - Muslims The table below shows that in Uttar Pradesh, 27% of prison inmates are Muslims although their proportion in the stateтАЩs population is 20%. In Gujarat, Muslims form only 10% of the stateтАЩs population but their proportion among the prisoners is a shocking 27%. This is the worst record among all states. In Assam, the state with the highest Muslim population (Jammu & Kashmir and Lakshadweep have more but they are Union Territories), 45% of prisoners are Muslims although in the stateтАЩs population their share is 34%.  What is common to these three states is that they have BJP-led governments and (not coincidentally) a high degree of communal polarisation fostered by the Sangh Parivar and BJP. In UP, the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in 2017 and it has been energetically pursuing Muslim-baiting policies whether it be the so-called anti-love-jihad campaign or encouragement to provocative anti-Muslim shows of strength, or the brutal attack on anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protestors which started in the last months of 2019 (the resulting imprisonments would be included in this data which is till December 2019). Gujarat, of course, is the well-known crucible of aggressive Hinduism where the BJP has been in power for over 25 years, and which saw one of the most barbaric anti-Muslim pogroms in IndiaтАЩs history in February-March 2000. Assam in the North-East is a recent conquest of BJP but the simmering communal tensions cross-cutting ethnic fractures have been weaponised by the Sangh Parivar/BJP for electoral gains. The result is this high proportion of Muslim prisoners. West Bengal presents an interesting facet of this issue: it has been governed by the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress since 2011 which tirelessly portrays itself as a defender of minority rights. Yet, the stateтАЩs prisoners include 37% from the Muslim community, although its share in the stateтАЩs population is 27%. Clearly, the TMC government is paying lip service to defending the interests of Muslims whereas its machinery looks no different from a BJP governmentтАЩs when it comes to imprisoning Muslims. State GovernmentsтАЩ Role тАУ Dalits & Adivasis A similar picture emerges if one looks at state-wise data on dalit and adivasi inmates of prisons, as shown in the table below.  UP, Gujarat, Assam, Madhya Pradesh (all BJP ruled states) and Bihar (ruled by Janata Dal-United/BJP alliance) тАУ all of them have much higher proportions of dalits and adivasis in jails compared with the population shares in respective states. While in UP, 24% of prisoners are dalit compared with 21% salits in the population, even the tiny adivasi community in UP (just 0.6%, concentrated in Sonabhadra district) has not been spared and make up 5% of the stateтАЩs prison population. Gujarat shows a similar kind of hostility towards dalits and adivasis as it does to Muslims, with aalits making up 16% of prisoners compared with their population share of 7% and adivasis forming another 16% of prison inmates, slightly more than their 15% share in overall population of state. In MP, a BJP government was installed after engineering defections of some greedy Congress MLAs earlier this year. So, the data would refer to the period under Congress government led by Kamal Nath, who had narrowly led the Congress to victory in 2018. But an analysis of past years of uninterrupted BJP rule confirms that the short-lived Congress ministry in the state simply continued what the BJP had been doing all these years. In Bihar, too, BJP gained power in 2016 by overthrowing of the elected JDU-Rashtriya Janata Dal government and forming a fresh post-election alliance with Nitish KumarтАЩs JDU. Yet, the two allies have continued their hostility towards dalits and the small adivasi community, as can be seen from the table above. Bihar has 16% dalit share in its population but in the prisons, this share shoots up to 21%. Similarly, though the adivasis make up only 1.3% of the stateтАЩs population, they are 4% of prisoners. Odisha is a state with a non-BJP non-Congress government led by Naveen Patnaik for the past two decades. It has 17% dalit and 23% adivasi population тАУ that makes up about 40% of the stateтАЩs whole population. But, even with such a sizeable presence, these communities face the wrath and bias of the criminal justice system. As much as 30% of prison inmates are dalits and 28% adivasis тАУ together making up 58% of the stateтАЩs prisoners.  What Needs To Be Done Most legal or prison reform commissions or committees set up by the governments have conveniently ignored this ongoing injustice. Most of the political parties, barring the Left, have never addressed this because they only seek to indulge in patronage politics тАУ protect their own supporters and disregard others. Rights and advocacy groups, too, often tend to ignore this. Any of the usual prescriptions for changing this tragic situation are some kind of prison reform or measly legal aid. The system is too powerful and its arms too long. To change this situation, first, a thorough and comprehensive enquiry needs to be carried out, which should include collection of complete data on the economic, educational, social background of the inmates of prisons, an analysis of the cases they are charged (or convicted) with and an immediate disposal of all undertrials bail applications (as per legal provisions), especially those from Muslim, dalit and adivasi communities. In addition, there should be investigation of political or agitational charges against these inmates, and their speedy disposal. This is necessary because many Muslims, dalits and tribals have been jailed for protesting on a range of democratic demands, such as opposition to takeover of forest land for unscrupulous natural resource exploitation or infrastructure building; against caste atrocities; against communal laws (like the CAA) or falsely implicated in charges of communal and casteist nature. All this needs to be backed by a wider, more sweeping, movement in defence of the rights and interests of the minorities, dalits and adivasis, especially in these times when a government of revanchist and obscurantist standard bearers is in power, and is functioning with impunity","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

The girl has been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in Aligarh medical college. She managed to give her statement to the police days after the incident and has stated that she was raped by four upper caste men on September 14 when she had gone to collect fodder for animals. Earlier, based on her brother's complaint, the police had booked a man identified as Sandeep for attempt to murder and under the provisions of the SC/ST Act. The accused was arrested and remanded to judicial custody after the family alleged that he had tried to kill the girl over some old enmity. On Tuesday after the girl's statement, rape charges were added to the FIR and three more people were booked. ""One more accused has been held and others, too, will be arrested soon,"" Hathras SP Vikrant Vir, said. Additional SP Prakash Kumar said the girl's statement under section 161 of CrPC was not recorded earlier by the investigating officer as the girl had been in the ICU after she was referred to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Aligarh from Hathras district hospital. He said the charge sheet would be filed soon. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President Deepak Kumar met the survivor and alleged that the family was being threatened by the accused as well as the police. He said that he would give a detailed report on the matter to party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi and party state chief Ajay Kumar Lallu. Congress leader Sheoraj Jivan Valmiki, who also reached Hathras on Wednesday to meet the survivor's family members, has demanded action against police officers for delay in recording the statement, adding that injustice to the members of the Dalit community would not be tolerated.

In a statement issued to the media today, JIH Vice President тАУ Prof Salim Engineer said: тАЬJamaat-e-Islami Hind condemns the alleged gang rape of a Dalit girl in Boolgarhi village, Hathras district, UP. It is reported that she is in the ICU at a hospital in Aligarh and on a ventilator, fighting for her life. Her tongue was cut off; the spinal cord severely injured and has several injuries on her neck. Four upper caste men have been charged with gang rape and attempt to murder along with the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police have managed to arrest three of the accused. Reports suggest that the village has around 600-odd families of which only 15 families belong to the Dalit community. The Dalits always faced harassment and intimidation at the hands of the upper-caste villagers who make up around 400 families.тАЭ Prof Salim Engineer averred: тАЬWe demand expeditious inquiry and trial of the case and expect the UP government to ensure that swift justice is delivered to the victim. Cases of rape and sexual harassment are on the rise in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Recently there have been cases of rape of minors in Maharajganj, Lakhimpur Kheri, Meerut and Greater Noida. The administration must take cognizance of this spike in sexual crimes by sprucing its law and order machinery. Crimes increase in places where criminals feel emboldened by weak law enforcement and feel that they can тАШmanageтАЩ the тАШsystemтАЩ and go unpunished. The question of Dalit atrocities is a long unresolved problem in India and requires both society and the state to contribute in solving it. They remain barred from entry into places of worship, denied access to water facilities, and seating among other upper-caste villagers On the one hand, the state has to ensure that there will be zero-tolerance for any hate crime and Dalit atrocity and no violation of dignity will go unpunished. Moreover, social activists, religious leaders and political parties must take up the project of social engineering and motivate people to adhere to the principle of equality, universal brotherhood and human fraternity. The dream of economic prosperity despite gross income inequality and social injustice is a disillusionment that we can ill afford to harbor.тАЭ Comments are closed. 8 September 2021 0 comment 8 September 2021 0 comment 7 September 2021 0 comment 6 September 2021 0 comment 5 September 2021 0 comment 2 September 2021 0 comment 31 August 2021 0 comment 28 August 2021 0 comment    08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 07 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 06 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 05 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 02 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 28 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 19 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 17 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 14 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 06 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 05 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 26 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 05 Jun 2021 | 0 comment 29 Aug 2020 | 0 comment 31 Oct 2019 | 0 comment 27 Jun 2019 | 0 comment 08 Apr 2019 | 0 comment VISIT OTHER USEFUL WEBSITES Copyright ┬й 2018 Jamaat-e-Islami Hind.

The incident took place near Congress Rapar MLA's office in the area and was captured in a CCTV camera. The victim, Devjibhai Maheshwari, was a senior activist of the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF) and of the Indian Legal Professionals Association. Police on Saturday nabbed a 22-year-old man from Mumbai's Malad area in connection with the killing of the lawyer.

They abducted her from the agricultural fields, raped and assaulted her in the most brutal manner тАУ lacerated her tongue, broke her neck and spinal cord, and left her paralysed on all four limbs. A little while later, her mother, who was hard of hearing, discovered her daughter in a pool of blood. But the four men, in spite of her motherтАЩs presence, behaved in an aggressive and insolent manner. The four men belonged to the Thakur caste, an important political vote bank in Uttar Pradesh. It is the caste to which Uttar PradeshтАЩs Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, belongs. Consequently, the Thakurs, many who consider themselves to be the political overlords, act with impunity in UPтАЩs villages. Despite being a case of rape by four Thakur men, the UP Police did not book a rape case against the accused. Initially, they lodged a case of attempt to murder and another under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police registered a case much later when the victim regained consciousness and gave a statement to the police. Despite the serious injuries, the police admitted the victim to a hospital in Hathras district. Later, the police moved her to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh. But as her condition began to deteriorate, she was shifted to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. But by then, it was too late. Within a few hours, on September 29, 2020, she died of a cardiac arrest.

This is the transcript of Gaurav Somwanshi's talk on June 21st, 2020) Whatever I'm going to talk about today is primarily built upon the articles that I wrote, back in September 2016-17. Of course, I've built upon many other things, but the core has remained more or less the same. In fact, IтАЩll be quoting most of them directly. So those articles were written in the aftermath of what was happening regarding the Rohith Vemula institutional murder case. Because many different kinds of reactions were popping up, but there was a certain kind of trend in them. And so that was one trigger. The second was the readiness of the mainstream to welcome the word Dalit or any other questions on caste. I remember when I was a child, I hardly ever heard that word, other than in my own family, when there was the talk of the autobiographies; but nowhere outside. But then later on, it became more ubiquitous. I have never heard of the word much in my home or in the community as much as it has been heard outside. It's not a word that we use to address each other. How we address each other is with Jai Bhim ┬нтАУ just normal human beings proudly claiming their Ambedkarite legacy and just saying Jai Bhim. But getting called Dalit from the outside, that's something that was happening a lot more. So, in the wake of that entire scenario, these articles were written. And I'm going to mostly summarize the arguments that I was making back then. So, as I said, one of the things that happened, I think all of us must remember, was that the Allahabad court judge appointed to the inquiry commission declared that Rohith Vemula was not a Dalit. So that was their response to the mass movement that had erupted across universities rather organically. Of course, it was appropriated later on, but while it was alive, that is the kind of strategy they had to deploy. They had to say that he's not a Dalit. What was it supposed to do? I mean, keeping aside the disgusting aspect of this strategy by the murdering administration, more importantly, I decided to ask myself that why the space for this savarna strategy was even created? And what narratives is it drawing upon? Because weapons and tools do not exist in isolation, right? They are created, time and again, as and when narratives are pushed forward, appropriated and all of that process goes on. So, what narratives were they drawing upon when they said Rohith Vemula was not a Dalit? Why did they think that this strategy would even work? And of course, the second thing was what I just said: the rising comfort, eagerness, enthusiasm, readiness to include the word Dalit everywhere тАУ no matter if it's a syllabus or a column, or a book that youтАЩre going to write which will have a certain section on it, or a new course. The word Dalit was proliferating at a great scale and almost every major mainstream media outlet, be it television channel, magazine, or social media page, had something or the other containing the word Dalit. So, what had really changed? Was it really the case that the assertion is now so powerful that it's making its way into the mainstream, or rather, the hegemonic imagination? Or was it the perversion of the same assertion by the Savarnas and they were trying to commoditize that identity? Because if the oppressor is celebrating you for some reason, then isn't it common-sense to view it with caution? We spent our childhood just fighting with the Savarna gangs regarding the reservation debates. That was in vogue at that time. I think it's not so much in vogue right now. So earlier it was like, the entire caste system and everything, just drop everything and you have to debate over reservations. So, reservation is equal to caste system was the equation. And now we have Dalit is equal to the caste system. And hence Dalit is getting propped up everywhere. But this is not representation. This is not a representation where people belonging to Dalit community would be given a chance to exist as equals in the spheres of power, where only Brahmin-Savarnas used to exist before. No. This is тАУ even tokenism is such a mild word тАУ this is a very dehumanizing tokenism where you have to exist as a Dalit man, play the role of a Dalit man and you have to do this in stark contrast to everyone around you. So that is why Kachra in Lagaan has a physical handicap. And it just doesn't end there. In 1983, Vijay Tendulkar wrote the play Kanyadaan and the play is entirely about how a Mahar man beats up his Brahmin wife, and itтАЩs essentially because he's a Mahar, and that's the whole conclusion of the play. But that's not all. In the original play in Marathi, the Mahar man is just an average person, an average Dalit; I should say an average Mahar in their perception, whatever that means. But when this play was translated to Bengali and played over there, they had to add a physical deformity to him. So that is the steep level of dehumanizing tokenism that they have to go through. And it has now almost become like a ceremonial object presented to the world where you have to speak about your Dalit experiences. How is it more different than the Saraswati Pooja that everyone does before any kind of ceremony? Instead of the Saraswati Pooja, now we have to do this hom havan about Dalit, Dalit, Dalit and Dalit, and say yes, now we are very woke regarding the caste question. Also, it has been my experience and observation so far that most of the liberal minded upper castes of India, or at least the ones claiming to be so, can't handle a Dalit who is fighting to be an equal human. They just can't. But what they really embrace with open arms is a human being who has tweaked and morphed himself/herself into a convenient caricature of what they have defined to be a Dalit man or a Dalit woman. If you are ready to play that role, then they will give you columns to write and international academic opportunities under their gaze, fancy conference invites, a barrage of heart emoticons all over social media and then applause that would shame any rockstar. This is also what they mean when they say pass the mic. What does pass the mic really mean? Pass the mic doesn't mean that I will be able to dismantle the stage, but just that I will be given a chance to perform on their stage. So that is not something that one is interested in doing, if one is really serious about annihilation of caste, right? So why does this happen? Why is this narrative issued: pass the mic to them, tell us about the Dalit experiences, inclusion, diversity and all of these modern tantra-mantras? Why do they keep popping up? Now, before I proceed ahead, this is something more of a disclaimer. And I think that everyone is aware of it, but it's very important for me, lest I am misrepresented later on. So, I'll have to explain first what an assertion is, and I'm sure everyone in the talk knows, but IтАЩm going to repeat. So, my own assertion of who I am, and also the rejection of who I am not, it takes place in the response to certain strains of casteism that exist around me. So, let's look at two such different strains of casteism. So, in the first case тАУ and I think many scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and anyone else whoтАЩs not a Brahmin-Savarna would have experienced this тАУ there'll be a constant onslaught by the caste society, when they're trying to tell me who they think I am, when they say things like SC has no merit. And this is the most readily relatable when your surrounding society is so called right-wing upper-caste. In such instances, rejection of what they say I am becomes assertion. Now in the second case, the situation isn't so different when your surrounding society is, let's say, of some liberal kind, or any place where you have managed to push yourself to a certain limit. So, in the second strain of casteism, just to give an example, let's say I'm becoming more and more vocal on caste, and there is a constant downpouring of тАЬNo, no, no, but we are all humansтАЭ. So, suddenly they remember that weтАЩre all humans and IтАЩm not a scheduled caste individual. Only because I'm trying to threaten their spaces, they tell me that past is past. And this happens because a major part of the brahmanical ploy has been to erase history while keeping everything else intact. And just to quote Kuffir da, as he said, Indian history is such a colossal crime because by depriving dalit-bahujans of any past, it steals their future too. So quite often we find ourselves alienated in our own country, like Babasaheb said. But again, coming back to those two different kinds of assertion, which seem different only on a superficial level. So, in the first example, weтАЩre going to just look at three lines from a poem by Madduri Nageshbabu titled Caste Certificate. So, how he ends the poem is: my caste certificate shall become the foreword of the new history that I shall write So, here he is asserting his own caste certificate and making assertions of oneтАЩs own social and historical location, to make sense of the present and to push back against the burden of the Brahmanical machinery. This is exactly what is again echoed in a different sense by the writer Shankarrao Kharat. And after conversion, he's saying that I am not a Mahar, I am not an untouchable, IтАЩm not a dalit, I'm not even a Hindu. I'm a Buddhist, and I have become a human being now. I am not lowborn or inferior. And now I am a human being like all others. So, do you think that NageshbabuтАЩs assertion that my caste certificate is now my foreword, as well as Mr. Shankarrao KharatтАЩs assertion, are these two really opposite? Because they're really not. They were placed in certain contexts. Nageshbabu was countering a certain context. Shankarrao Kharat was countering a certain context. In one case, they were claiming their historical and social location without compromising their humanity. In the second case, they were rejecting the dehumanized definitions of humanity and just accepting that now I am a complete human being and I accept that for myself тАУ it doesn't matter how you see me. So, as you can see, considering the contexts, the assertion, as well as the rejection of oneтАЩs social or historical location, are in fact, at the base, the same sentiment. So, these are the same because they arise as more of an immune response of the soul. And we have to constantly fight against the Brahmanical tactic, or as Phuley says the brahmani kawa. So, what is brahmani kawa? The caste society will do one of the two things: when it needs to demoralize or dehumanize you, it will either bombard you with caste-based slurs and insults to engrave your inferiority in your soul; or if it is ever faced with the risk of acknowledging its own monstrosity, because now the threat is real and the oppressed are pushing back, in that case, they will try to erase and turn a blind eye to the entire context and background and they will say that whatever is the cause of misery is not caste and so on. So, blurting out casteist slurs, as well as the liberal kneejerk reaction of arenтАЩt we all human, are two sides of the same coin. And even though the assertion that is given against them might come off as opposite, but it's not opposite. And I have an example to share regarding how it is so. And that's why I want to focus upon that. The actual question is not how I am portraying myself or what my definition of everything is, because mostly those definitions have been hijacked long ago and the focus is how they are now manipulating this whole thing. I'd like to just share a small video by Mr. Raja Dhale. It's in Marathi, but IтАЩll translate. It's less than one minute. Even if you don't understand Marathi, itтАЩs very powerful, the first two lines. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5IrRj2Crc What you just saw was a founding member of Dalit Panther itself, Mr. Raja Dhale. So, the contribution of Raja Dhale in the movement is, of course, unparalleled, and I need not explain who he is when IтАЩve already said that heтАЩs a founder of Dalit Panther. And what is he saying right now? He's saying that Dalit hi majhi identity naahi, mi Dalit naahi. ItтАЩs very easy to understand. HeтАЩs saying that, Dalit is not my identity. I am not a Dalit. So, do you really think that he's trying to negate any kind of history of the Dalit Panther or anything? Of course not. Dalit Panther arose in a certain context, it had a certain purpose and it was countering certain tactics. Now what Brahmanism actually is, we first have to understand. Brahmanism is not a certain rigid set of ideologies. No, it's rigid about maintaining the status quo in the material world. For that they can morph any type of ideology, they will do any kind of thing. All mutations are permissible. Just to give an example, when Akbar came over and he was ruling everywhere, the Brahmins wrote an extra Upanishad as a tribute to him and it was titled Allah Upanishad. So, there is no rigid ideology or principles, even of the wicked kind, other than the thought of supremacy and how to maintain it. The caste system is basically ensuring that the caste mode of production keeps on perpetually going one generation after the other. And in order to do this, it doesn't matter what ideology or what word they have to choose, which caste they have to nominate as kshatriyas, which caste they have to give the bronze medal, someone else a silver medal, everything is permissible, as long as the supremacy is maintained. Whose supremacy? Primarily the Brahmins, surrounded by the Savarnas who are most beneficial to them. And that is why it's more important to understand in that context. That's why this video of Raja Dhale, if somebody is using it to say, тАЬsee, heтАЩs opposing Dalit PantherтАЭ, that's obviously stupid, right? Dalit Panther is still one thing and what you wanted to achieve with it, that's also there, and what you're saying right now is also there. They do not exist in opposition. Please understand that. He says towards the end that Dalit, hi laadleli identity ahe. Laadleli identity means it is an imposed identity. I am not born as a Dalit. I am seen as a Dalit by the rest of the society. Now, the question that we'll see later on in the talk, is how much the way that you are being seen actually ends up affecting how you see yourselves and also the world around you. That's more of a question that I (usually) leave open for introspection, but I think in this talk, it would be okay to discuss it. If this were a public talk, I would just focus my talk entirely on the Brahmin-Savarna. But here I can talk more about the perception of the identity, which began as an assertion. But now the risk is very real that instead of giving any kind of threat to the Brahmin-Savarna empire, it will just end up morphing me and my own soul тАУ I mean soul in a non-religious sense. So, what's happening today with that identity, according to my own personal opinion, as well as what I've been reading from all the brilliant writers around me.. In Philosophy of Hinduism, Babasaheb said that the purpose of the caste system is basically to realize the ideal and to idealize the real. What does this mean? This means that the varna system is an ideal. It doesn't exist. Of course, it doesn't exist because we are basically born the same. But now that's the ideal of the Manusmriti. How do you realize the ideal? So, they will ensure that the current inequalities of life are more deeply entrenched and more and more consolidation of power happens in certain castes and the rest are dehumanized further. In fact, someone else's dehumanization shows your own god status, and all of this is kept in place. So, what is happening now is that they are trying to realize the ideal. That is what Manusmriti also wanted to do, right? How does it characterize the Shudra category, the Chandal category and many other things? It does so by defining them first. Now that was the idea of the Manusmriti. And what is the idea behind Manusmriti and philosophy of Hinduism? If you ask, why am I born this way? Then they will simply say because of the law of karma. The law of karma basically states that you might have a great potential of being a Kshatriya or a Brahmin later on, but please not in this life because whatever (caste) you're born in this life is because of your deeds in your past life. So, itтАЩs as good as saying that you don't have any control, just accept whatever you have been assigned by birth. And the entire structure was about defining these categories. So, they had set the ideal very nicely. And the only thing they wanted to do, and are still trying to do, especially with this whole idea of the consolidation of the entire Indian empire, was to ensure that we can realize the ideal. So, when I use the word ideal, it doesn't mean a good ideal. It just means the Brahminical ideal, the ideal according to them and how they're trying to realize it. So, yes, of course today, they don't really throw Manusmriti at your face and say that you are born as a Shudra and this is what the shloka number so and so says; but of course it has evolved. Again, getting back to the earlier example: doesn't matter what happens, maybe we become acquainted with more words, like fascism and nepotism and many other kinds of progressive/regressive isms that will come up and prop up again and again, but does the caste system really change? Has the material structure of the caste mode of production changed at all? It hasn't. It means that there must be something again, that theyтАЩll have to reinvent or at least change to ensure that the categories are again, getting more real. How do they do that? I think, and this is also in opposition to strictly what Babasaheb said. He said that, and everyone knows this quote: Unlike a drop of water, which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being to the society in which he lives. Man's life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. So that's what he clearly says. And not to joke around, but probably now the new feminism in vogue will say that why he is saying man and his and all, but let's not go there. But that's how the tools have been already made in order to build a facade of being progressive and attack what is essentially the main ideology of annihilation of caste. But again, getting back to how they're trying to realize the ideal. In fact, Babasaheb also says this repeatedly in other contexts as well. When Babasaheb was quoting Mendel in Annihilation of Caste тАУ I don't have the excerpts in front of me right now тАУ but it says very clearly and everyone must have read that already, that caste is not equal to race. You cannot say that there are genetic differences between one and the other. He clearly makes a distinction that do we really think that the Brahmin of Kashmir and the Brahmin of Chennai, they belong to the same so-called racial stock? Of course not. But that is an ideal. That is what they want to realize. So that's very important. That is the ideal condition, right? There's a varna system and then there are all of these various ways to ensure it happens. Now, what I'm going to say is that the role of the Manusmriti in helping to realize the ideal is a task for which the baton is carried forward and now academia has taken up the baton. I'm going to put forward an argument that I made back in 2016. The argument was that now they're trying to use reification, or racialization, or converting something into a single block or a homogeneous block. And this is happening in a great amount to the Dalit category. So (weтАЩll see) how does it happen first, and later, we'll see whom does it benefit and whom does it not. So, reification comes from the German word verdinglichung, which basically means making into a thing. So, turning the intangible into tangible. Thingification. Now it's very important to understand that my own identity as Gaurav is forged by dozens of external factors, historical and contemporary, and also partly by how I choose to respond to them. But it does not mean even for a second that I am a different thing in itself. Identity assertion does not mean тАУ and here lies the crucial difference тАУ that my biology, my essence as a human being, or my mind, all of that is in some way distinct from the rest of the non-Dalits and somehow completely equivalent to anyone who comes under their definition of a Dalit. It's basically like saying me and Rahul are exactly the same. Like, if we are dalit, then we are something else, like a different race. Now, if you think that this a very common-sensical thing to say, then please know that the invisibilization and the erasure of this distinction, this simple distinction, this is what reification means. Forget reification, weтАЩll just call it racialization. This is what racialization means. You are constructing races. But this distinction is the most crucial one, because it lies at the heart of the fight for the annihilation of caste. And what is that fight? It is the fight to reclaim all of human dignity and all the existential freedom in its widest possible meaning, which comes to me just by the virtue of being born as a human being. Because if we are aware of this distinction, then we can rightly situate my Dalitness as arising from someone else's Brahminness, without which it wouldn't exist. And hence, we need to zoom out of our microscopes and focus on the larger, grand source of caste. In fact, probably after this argument is over, Anu di and Rahul can also expand upon the ridiculousness of claiming that someone born and brought up and enjoying all the US benefits still claims to be a Dalit. To summarize this, I'll just quote Ta-Nehisi Coates. He says it simply in one line. He says that race is the child of racism, not the father. It's not a chicken and egg thing. First we had racism, then we had race. Because racism chose to тАУ in the context of West тАУ arbitrarily use a geographical setting and skin color. And by using that as a differentiating factor, they started creating races out of it. I hope it doesn't, but it's certainly happening over here as well. So, unless we introspect on this thing, then what will happen, what are the risks? The risk is that, this entire caste question тАУ which is the question of all Indians, of the subcontinent, rather тАУ this will be twisted into something like a survival competition between two species. Like we had about 15,000 years ago or earlier, Neanderthals vs. Homo Sapiens. And this will just be like two people fighting for co-living. And this is why it has become so convenient for NGOs and progressives alike, to focus on the Dalit part and squeeze out the juice from that term, as much as they can, and call themselves anti-caste without ever having had to land a single blow on the system which is facilitating that entire oppression. Now it is the reification of the term Dalit, which is allowing for the interrogation of caste to begin there and end there also. So it is like that joke by Arshad Warsi in Munnabhai MBBS: тАЬArey! Ye room to khulte saath hi band ho gaya (Hey! This room ends as soon as it starts)тАЭ. ThatтАЩs whatтАЩs happening with Dalit also. Dalit is that small room, like we have a devghar (god-house) in Marathi houses. So, it's like, if you want the progressive house, you have a small devghar for Dalit over there. Again, this is the reification, or rather the racialization, of the Dalit identity, which is converting it into a commodity. Less than an identity, but more than a commodity. And this is what is ensuring that Dalit becomes something to be studied, to be critiqued, to be used in a comparison to the thousands of intersections that could be made: middle-class Dalit, urban Dalit, rural Dalit, Dalit capitalist, sarkari Dalit, chaatu Dalit, ye Dalit, wo Dalit. All of these slices could be made because the cake has been made, the cake has been served on the platter, then why would they not slice it? And in fact, it even grants them additional spaces to be usurped by taking one token Dalit and opening up a Dalit studies department. Now weтАЩll just come to the final part. The final part is whom does it benefit? So, before going there, and in fact, in tandem with Sruti HerbertтАЩs talk last Saturday, where she discussed the non-Dalit part of Sharmila Rege, I'm going to take an example. So, in my article Tilak, the granddaddy of all Hindutvavadis[1], I talk about Tilak. What was making his blood boil in the 1930s? So those were the times when the Maharashtrian anti-caste movements had begun using words like Brahmanetar. Brahmanetar just means non-Brahmin, other than Brahmin. So, an editorial was published in his celebrated, so-called nationalist newspaper Kesari, in which he used to abuse Shahu Maharaj more than he abused the British. So, in that editorial on 26th March, 1913, Tilak wrote in a very angry frustrated manner against the word Brahmanetar, he was arguing against the usage of the word non-Brahmin. And he said that sahi hai, tum yahi use kar rahe ho. If you are using this word, then you must also include the British, the Muslims, the trees, the non-trees the rats, the jungles and everything. So, if it's a Brahmanetar thing, then it should include everything, right? The rest of the world. Do you find any kind of link between TilakтАЩs anger over the use of the word Brahmanetar/non-Brahmin and the eagerness of people like Sharmila Rege to use the word non-Dalit and also call themselves non-Dalit? Is it not the same line? What is the distinction between the two? ItтАЩs the same thing. He was arguing against non-Brahmin. Here we have the entire academic structure using the word non-Dalit. Tilak would be so proud. And how did it come to this? In BabasahebтАЩs own words, how did the fight to reclaim human dignity become an act of proclaiming one's own Dalitness as opposed to marking out the Brahmin-Savarna? And it's a very simple question. As Raja Dhale said in his video, I am a human being and slavery has been imposed upon me. Untouchability has been imposed upon me. So why am I not тАУ I'm just personally saying тАУ why am I not a human being, but a special version of it? And the ones who are actually sitting on heaps of looted wealth and grotesque power, they have the privilege to be nothing but humans in present progressive discourses. So why did the assertion become an act of self-exotification? Why? And I'm not saying that it is something we are actively doing or that they are not at all responsible for it. They are the ones primarily responsible for creating these molds into which we have to fit. In fact, just to give you a funny anecdote тАУ I don't know if it's real or not, but it's there in a very popular play about Aurangzeb and Sambhaji. So, Sambhaji never bows down in front of Aurangzeb. And Aurangzeb is very frustrated and he knows that Sambhaji is never, ever going to bow down in front of him. So just to make his own heart happy, he commands everyone to lower the height of the gate at the entrance, so that, at least when he is entering into the cabin of Aurangzeb, Sambhaji is going to bow down. Of course, mostly it's a tale only, but the point that I'm trying to make is that this is how the gates have been defined. If you have to enter their spaces, then the gates have been lowered and you have to lower yourself, crouch your humanity, and become a smaller, twisted version of whatever you are so that you fit comfortably into their entire scheme of things. So, why do I have to do that? Gail Omvedt, in her PhD dissertation, says that Ambedkar would refer to himself as a non-Brahmin scholar. So that is the word he uses for himself: non-Brahmin scholar. So, is Babasaheb using the potency of a label to make himself stand apart by calling himself a Dalit scholar, or is he using the power of a label brilliantly to mark out the oppressor тАУ the one who is an actual abnormality, the one who is an aberration in humanity, in this nation's entire blighted history, as well as in this case, the nationтАЩs entire scholarship? Why is that not getting marked out? And like some of my friends, I too had the pressure to sometimes prove on social media back then, how actually real my Dalitness is. And I know now that this is not assertion, because that is different from the mental burden of constantly having to reiterate to one self and others that one is a quintessential Dalit. There is another anecdote. I used to be 22-23 years old. So, at that time I had just posted something on Facebook and my father came to know that I've posted something on Facebook regarding his life. And then he called me and he was so angry and he shouted at me that I have no right to talk about his embarrassing experiences. He has chosen to portray himself as a doctor, a surgeon, but not what I was trying to do. His experiences were something he had told me as a father to his son, and it was not for me to post on social media. So that was his own assertion of his own identity, and I kind of broke the whole thing. That's how it happens. Because if you are a victim of that gaze, you will try to cater to it. Inferiority complex, that's a birthday gift that you will have, if you become a victim of that gaze. That self-exotification, that there is something different in me, isn't something inherently different, isn't there something really, really fundamentally different between me and someone else as a person? I'm not saying in terms of the surroundings and everything else, but intrinsically. As a human being, before anything happens to me, whatever I am at that level, if I try to feel that there is something different than everyone else, then that's the whole crux of Brahmanism, right? Because by saying that there are different categories, someone is born from the mouth, then arms, then the legs, and so on, the distinction that Brahmanism makes is that it is made directly at the birth level. How are we going to get any help by just inverting this? You don't invert anything. No, by inverting you only strengthen what is already there. So that's why if someone is saying that you don't have any merit, the right answer is not to say that inherently we have more merit than you have, it's just that we don't get opportunity. The right response is just to say that no, everyone is born with the same level of intellect, capacity to feel human emotions and everything else, but the inequalities exist because everything else is not the same. The human essence тАУ I do not like using the word soul тАУ the human essence remains the same. I'm not even going to use the word тАЬmore-or-lessтАЭ, it is the same. It is exactly the same. And any twists, any distinctions to try to make it different at this level is going to ensure that this whole system proceeds, and you might not even get to experience this short human life as a human being. That's the real twist of the caste system. In fact, I'd like to quote James Baldwin. James Baldwin says that the only time your life is destroyed is when you accept the definition of a Negro. He's not saying you're destroyed when you're killed. He's not saying you are destroyed when you are shot or when 10 swords go through you. The real destruction of the human essence happens when you think you are not human. And it could be a superior case or an inferior case. So that's why I think if anyone needs help it is the bhudevtas and everyone else who feels that there is a certain kind of special thing that they are born with. Again, getting back to the original argument, I said that there used to be a pressure on the social media. So why was this pressure? Why does this pressure exist to mark out the untouchable тАУ and there is no pressure to mark out the ones who are not ready to touch тАУ as if he's born that way and not made or looked at in that certain sense? Why is there no pressure on the Brahmin-Savarna to speak on his or her regressive heritage before speaking authoritatively on what the problems of every oppressed community are? Because again, they have been given the super privilege. They don't exist as humans, as I argued back then in 2016, they are existing as meta-humans, free from bondage of history and even reality. They don't even have to be answerable for their nepotism, their caste networks, etc. It's just how they are. They are meta-humans. They can be one thing today, the next thing later on. And they can be whatever they need to be in order to be on top in that particular arena. And again, it's important to say that it's not an argument to change some nomenclature in the movement. I'm not saying that letтАЩs not call ourselves Dalit, letтАЩs call ourselves Scheduled Caste, this is what weтАЩre going to print on our banners. It is not that. This is just an argument to reassess how we, as either Dalits or persons belonging to any oppressed communities, how we are being made to look at ourselves and speak about ourselves, because it affects us even in our most personal introspective moments. There is something within us, a crucial part of the identity of being a human, that is being robbed by the very route of our identity assertion, because that route is now being policed and guarded by the Brahmin-Savarna liberals and academia. And before doing anything out there in the field or on paper, we first need to fully claim this robbed humanity or robbed individuality, in our own hearts and our own minds, and then call out the oppressor as being the oppressor. And why do we need to do this again? Because the logical consequence of the era of the Dalit autobiographies, should have been Brahmin-Savarna biographies. I am not saying that IтАЩm against that whole trend. My own uncle wrote a book, four or five years ago, and all of us are angry at him. And imagine the title of the book, such a dramatic title: Mi Ek Asprushya (I, an Untouchable). We literally had a laugh over it and he also had a laugh later on, because we realized that it's useless, because it had a certain context. When Sharankumar Limbale wrote Akkarmashi and when Baluta came, and there was Jevha mi Jaat Chorli Hoti, and Babytai KambleтАЩs autobiography, I don't need to name all of them, but that era (makes them relevant).. As I said, Brahminism is a system which only believes in superiority and maintenance of the status quo. So, the ideologies can keep changing. They are very flexible. So, they became very accustomed to this whole thing. In fact, as me and Rahul discussed Narhar Kurundkar and Gunwant has also discussed and IтАЩve also written on it on Round Table India[2]. So, they feel so comfortable to write an article, which was titled, Dalit yanni koshotun baher yaave, which means Dalits should get out of their caves and it gets published on 14th April. So imagine, what gave Kurundkar the power to use that kind of sweeping statements: Dalits do that, Dalits do this. I mean, koi school ka class hai kya ki 10th A ke sare log bahar aake khade ho (is this a school where the headmaster directs all students of section 10th A to go and stand outside). That's the kind of policing that happens because they ensure that we are now all in the same division тАУ 10th A mein sare log baithe hain (all students in 10th A are sitting there) тАУ and you can't be out of that. So, again, as IтАЩd argued in 2016, the logical consequence of the era of Dalit autobiographies should have been the biographies that we write about Brahmin-Savarna. So, biographies should be penned by the people from the oppressed groups, where they will tear down the whole palaces of the shastris and the landlords. In fact, this is how we began. We began by the very exposure of the Brahmanical system, if we consider our beginning as with the writings of Jotiba and Savitrimai Phule. If you consider that as the beginning of the modern era, then this is how it began, with the whole deconstruction. But somewhere along the way that part went missing. And we need to ask ourselves why, because the magnifying glass, which was supposed to be used for scanning the mechanisms of the caste system, was instead flipped and the Dalit, and sometimes the Adivasi became the sole object of its twisting and burning glare. Now we have some ridiculous inhuman studies, comparing fertility rates of a certain tribe with fertility rates of another tribe and so on. And especially, weтАЩre ignoring BabasahebтАЩs essential insight: he wrote this in an editorial in Janata, in which he says that the base is not the building. And if you want to change the base, then the building that has been constructed on it must be knocked down. So the question that we should pose to ourselves is, why did the base replace the building? Which means that тАУ and this was the title of the Round Table India article тАУ why did Dalit become the mascot for the caste system[3]? That's all it is. It's just a mascot. It has almost become that in the hands of the Brahmin тАУ again, I'm choosing my words very carefully тАУ in the hands of the Brahmin-Savarnas, Dalit has become almost an empty signifier. It has become a general weapon, a general tool, a multipurpose tool. They can use this to pit different bahujans against each other. Now they will try to pit Scheduled Caste A category against Dalit B category. As I said, the moment you give them a cake, they will slice that cake into intersections. I'm not saying that the cake was made by us. I'm just saying that that's how the whole thing was handed to us. But once the cake exists, once it is a thing, once it is a race, then they can make any kind of intersections because you agreed to it, right? If you already agreed to be a Dalit, then whatтАЩs the problem in saying that you're a middle-class Dalit or Dalit man and so on? And thus, it becomes a tool. It also becomes a tool not just to define us, but also to define them, which is what Rege did, calling herself and the entire Brahmin community and everyone else as non-Dalit, and ensuring that she's in the same category as Brahmin and Adivasi. Please note the seriousness of this. So, she is closer to Adivasis and all the Dalits are something else, different altogether. So, all the ex-untouchables, youтАЩre something else, but all the non-Dalits, as she calls herself and as all the Brahmin academics might be calling themselves, they are closer with everyone else who is not a Dalit. As I said in the beginning, they are now using this whole pass the mic strategy to purify their own stages, their newspapers, their journals, by including and harping the word Dalit. It has become a kind of a Ganga-Snan where they can skip the whole question of caste system and sprinkle some Dalit swadanusaar (according to taste), and you have a perfect progressive recipe at your table. So, the term Dalit is not going to be used or be useful in the context (of anti-caste assertion), I have observed. What exactly is now the potency of this term? Because the whole point should have been that as a human being, as far as I could stretch my wingspan, I could be anything, an artist, not just in my profession, but just how I look at myself. It would be so diverse. That whole possibility is being extinguished. It's being nipped in the bud because of this imposition of identity. ~ References  [1] https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8181:tilak-the-granddaddy-of-all-hindutvavadis&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132 [2] https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8295:on-brahmin-hegemony-a-short-note&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132 [3] https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9193:gaurav-somwanshi&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132  ~~~  This talk was transcribed by Anand Silodia Gaurav Somwanshi is CEO & Cofounder of EmerTech Innovations Pvt Ltd.

So far, six accused, including Bharat Raval, a resident of Malad West in Mumbai and native of Rapar, have been detained in the case even as a Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising seven senior police officers of Kutch Range was formed on Sunday to investigate the case. Fifty-year-old Maheshwari was murdered on Friday evening in Rapar of Kutch Gandhidham, allegedly by Raval, who is seen in the CCTV footage following the victim inside a building in Rapar town. Nine were booked in the murder case following a complaint by the victimтАЩs wife, Minaxiben Maheshwari. Mayur Patil, superintendent of police, Kutch Gandhidham, told The Indian Express, тАЬThe main accused was held from Mumbai on Saturday and we detained five more accused today (Sunday). We are yet to corroborate with the main accused regarding the role of the remaining accused in the murder and legal proceedings such as Covid test of the detainees are going onтАж An SIT, which will be overseen by the Inspector General of Kutch Range, with seven senior officers, including me, has also been formed.тАЭ On Saturday, Raval was held by a team of Mumbai Crime Branch and was handed over to the Gujarat Police for further investigation. According to police, Maheshwari was killed by Raval, a Brahmin, who objected to the social media posts made by the victim, critical of Brahminism. The last post on MaheshwariтАЩs Facebook post was a video of All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF) national president Waman Meshram saying that members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes were not Hindus. According to police, both Maheshwari and Raval had clashed repeatedly over the past one month where the latter had warned Maheshwari regarding his social media posts. Raval, Mumbai Police said, travelled to Rapar from Malad on Wednesday with the intention of murdering Maheshwari. CCTV footage from the area showed Maheshwari entering his office building at 6 pm on Friday and a man wearing a red T-shirt following him inside. Seconds later, the man runs out of the building and flees. An FIR was lodged against Raval and eight others тАУ Jaysukh Luhar, Khimji Luhar, Dhaval Luhar, Devubha Sodha, Vijaysinh Sodha, Mayursinh Sodha, Pravinsinh Sodha and Arjansinh Sodha тАУ for murder under Indian Penal Code section 302 and sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The victimтАЩs wife said in her complaint that her husband had gone to Rapar for some work on an ongoing legal case against the persons of Luhar community. She added that Maheshwari was the only lawyer who had agreed to represent the legal case against persons of Luhar community recently and he was frequenting police stations to get FIRs lodged. тАЬThe other accused named in the FIR are connected to Maheshwari through the legal cases he was representing. We are yet to find any connection between them and main accused, Raval,тАЭ said a senior police officer in Kutch. ЁЯУг The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Mani is a Tamilian who moved to Mumbai as a child, which is the explanation he offers for his bad Tamil. The difference in social standing between the protagonist and his boss is not a factor of class alone тАУ Mani (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is Dalit, and Acharya (M Nasser), a fellow Tamilian, is Brahmin. тАЬMoron, imbecile, knobheadтАЭ тАУ these are the epithets hurled by those in power at Mani and his ilk, irrespective of how much they try to please. As revenge, the тАЬmoronsтАЭ have come up with the term тАЬserious menтАЭ for educated people privileged enough to conduct studies on тАЬchutiasticтАЭ subjects. Awareness of the oppression that his family has suffered for generations, resentment towards Acharya and a determination to escape his present life in a cramped one-room tenement with his wife Oja and son Adi are all the motivation Mani needs to act in ways that are no less dishonest than the rackets run by these тАШserious menтАЩ. Directed by Sudhir Mishra (Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin, Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi), Serious Men parallels the games played by individuals from all the strata of society covered in the plot. Adi has a reputation as a child genius, which makes him a magnet for opportunistic politicians and school administrators. Soon he becomes nationally famous. Meanwhile, the media spotlight trained on Dr AcharyaтАЩs pet project has consequences for everyone concerned. The filmтАЩs screenplay by Bhavesh Mandalia and Abhijeet Khuman (additional screenplay credit: Niren Bhatt and Nikhil Nair), is drawn from the novel of the same name by Manu Joseph. At first it is sharp, funny and deliciously irreverent. Mani minces no words about his antagonism towards the haves around him, and the writers make no apologies for his attitude. He is who he is. Gradually though, despite the humour in the situations portrayed, especially in the satirical take on corruption that knows no social barriers, and despite the entertaining audacity of ManiтАЩs strategies, the film reveals its hollow core. Serious Men uses the word тАЬDalitтАЭ as a mere hook, but makes little distinction between class and caste, thus revealing its poor knowledge of the immutable nature of caste тАУ the whole point of the caste system is that even a Dalit who rises to a position of power and wealth is still deemed contemptible, whereas the social class an individual occupies can and does change depending on their financial status and consequent connections. In its gripping opening minutes, Serious Men makes all the right noises to establish that it intends to delve into the Dalit experience: Mani tells a story about his grandfather and on the notice board of his institute are the words, тАЬReservations cannot be the only compensation for treating fellow human beings like animals for the last 3,000 years.тАЭ That sentence in particular holds out the promise of empathy and a deep examination of caste practices within elite professional circles. Once ManiтАЩs caste identity is underlined though, nothing bad happens to him and his family that would not happen to any poor Indian irrespective of caste. This is in keeping with the view often expressed by the upper-caste urban elite тАУ including those who claim to be liberal тАУ that caste no longer exists тАЬat least among people like usтАЭ, and that caste and class are synonymous. A still from Serious Men. YouTube Serious MenтАЩs narrow understanding of the Dalit reality is rivalled by its problematic gender politics. Three women get reasonably significant screen time in the film: ManiтАЩs wife Oja (Indira Tiwari) serves the purpose of being a recipient of his pearls of wisdom, AcharyaтАЩs colleague Oparna Sengupta (Vidhi Chitalia) is condescendingly written as nothing more than an attractive young woman having an affair with her older male boss, and the politician Anuja (Shweta Basu Prasad) refuses to allow her team to play up her experience of domestic violence in public saying, тАЬтАжnext time no тАШDalit woman victim cardтАЩ shit for me, pleaseтАЭ тАУ words that would be music to the ears of those who, in the off-screen world, dub any expos├й of genuine oppression as тАЬthe woman card"", тАЬDalit cardтАЭ or тАЬplaying victimтАЭ. As if to warm the hearts of right-wingers, Serious Men even slips in a scene of a nun in a Mumbai school trying to convert a Dalit to Christianity with the lure of special schemes for the underprivileged. This episode furthers the long-running propaganda that schools run by IndiaтАЩs Christian minority are hotbeds of conversion (propaganda that fails to explain how then the percentage of Christians in IndiaтАЩs population remains stagnant and minuscule). Serious MenтАЩs superficial interpretation of caste, its male gaze and its pointed jab at a religious minority that is viewed with dislike by the current establishment are all disguised as satire that is carefully wrapped in a package of pacey writing, playful music by Karol Antonin and superb acting by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The women actors are under-utilised but excellent to the extent that they have space to be so. Nasser is rarely well-used by Hindi films тАУ here for a change he gets a solid role and in response he makes Acharya a nicely evil, non-clich├йd jerk. When Siddiqui is in full form, there are not many in Bollywood who can match up to him, but Aakshath Das playing Adi is more than up to the task. Siddiqui is a treat to watch in Serious Men although he does not look Tamilian from any angle (unlike Tiwari who fits the bill on that front). If you are willing to buy into that deceit then you might, like me, enjoy the thoughtful shades he lends to both the quirky and thoughtful aspects of ManiтАЩs character or have a lark listening to the peculiar tone in which he tells a hotel employee that he wants his beer тАЬnot extremely chilled, not warmтАЭ. This is not to suggest at all that the only issue with Serious Men is its problematic politics. Plotwise, the film rests on a foundation of extreme improbability. Mani manages to dupe experts and ordinary people with a particular scam that remains undiscovered for several years, although the very cornerstone of that con is shaky тАУ with just a momentтАЩs thought, it becomes glaringly evident that he could have been easily found out much earlier if even one person had asked an actually tough question or probed further when fobbed off with evasive answers. Conveniently for the film, no one does. Serious Men will stream on Netflix from 2 October.

"617",5670,"https://www.anews.com.tr/world/2020/09/30/rape-and-killing-of-dalit-woman-shocks-india-draws-outrage","Rape and killing of Dalit woman shocks India, draws outrage","The gang-rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system sparked outrage across the country on Wednesday with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying on the streets. The 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district. The woman's family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed, with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Tuesday, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several women activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read: ""Stop rape culture."" Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad asked Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits тАФ formerly known as ""untouchables"" and at the bottom of an unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy in India тАФ are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence. Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court. In the latest case, questions were also raised over a hasty cremation with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights. The woman was cremated early Wednesday with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home. Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the opposition Congress party leader, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as ""abusive and unjust."" In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime. In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged. Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts. According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 тАФ an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma of sexual violence.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA
"618",5675,"https://mattersindia.com/2020/09/two-dalit-rights-activists-nominated-to-21st-century-heroes-of-india/","Two Dalit rights activists nominated to ├втВм┼У21st Century Heroes of India├втВм┬Э","By Matters India Reporter Varanasi: Two Dalit rights activists from Varanasi, Utter Pradesh, among others, have been nominated to тАЬ21st Century Heroes of IndiaтАЭ from the perspective of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and other Indian Constitutional Values. Pippa Rann Books & Media, based in the United Kingdom, September 27 announced that Lenin Raghuvanshi and Shruti Nagvanshi, the two cofounders of the PeopleтАЩs Vigilance Committee on Human Rights (PVCHR), have been listed. PVCHR is a Varanasi-based NGO that works for the rights of Dalits for the last 25 years. тАЬI am happy to see my name in a club of veterans like Arundhati Roy, Swami Agnivesh and John Dayal along with an icon of hope Ms. Bilkis. I am earthworm to the fertile land of India for realization of universal values,тАЭ Nagvanshi told Matters India. Upon receiving the news, Raghuvanshi said, тАЬIt creates more accountable for hard work for the elimination of fascism from South Asia. It is honour of values of pluralism, diversity and inclusiveness which are guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.тАЭ Informing the news to both, Prabhu Guptara, board consultant, poet and publisher of Pippa Rann Books & Media, wrote in an email, тАЬIt is my honour to inform you [Raghuvanshi and Nagvanshi] that you are listed in the тАЬHeroes of the 21st CenturyтАЭ at www.pipparannbooks.com.тАЭ тАЬWith huge admiration and thanks for your enormous contributions over the decades to our nation,тАЭ said retired Professor Guptara, Cambridge, UK. Raghuvanshi and Nagvanshi are among 77 other personalities who have made a marked difference and contribution to society and the common good. Another person listed is John Dayal, one of IndiaтАЩs foremost human rights activists, a former member of the National Integration Council, and a co-founder and former Secretary-General of the All India Christian Council. In a career spanning over half a century, Dayal has been sub-editor, crime reporter, war correspondent, foreign correspondent, CEO, editor in chief, media professor, analyst, author of celebrated books, film critic and documentary filmmaker. When asked for his comments on his name inclusion into the list, Dayal told Matters India, тАЬI am honoured to be in this distinguished company, even if I feel I do not deserve it.тАЭ Explaining the further, he said that the 21st century is but two decades old, but the count begins with the dawn of Independence. Gandhi and the freedom fighters, Ambedkar and the Constitution makers, Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai and the doyens of science were the icons of the new India till the Emergency of 1975. Post Emergency till the COVID-19 lockdown, the icons are seeking freedom of the mind, of conscience. The real icons of his struggle are dead, murdered by the forces they had challenged. The survivors are those who fight but are perhaps not seen as really of the caliber of those they killed, he said. тАЬBut still, people like Arundhati, the Sen couple serving with the Tribals, Bunker and Aruna, Dilip Simeon тАУ and I will include Prof Shamsul Islam in the list -, and the several Muslims who have become symbolic of the CAA-NCR Shaheen Bagh, JNU and AMU struggles are my heroes,тАЭ Dayal said. тАЬAs are Tribals like Sori and Dalits such as Kanshi Ram fighting for dignity and rights. Their fearlessness, their courage and their voice will yet save the Constitution. I am averse to speaking for myself. It is for the people to say,тАЭ he added. The тАЬHeroes of the 21st CenturyтАЭ is a running list or overall list (https://pipparannbooks.com/21st-century-heroes-of-freedom-and-other-indian-constitutional-values/) тАЬWe will add new people as appropriate but not take any away тАУ a hero is a hero for all-time,тАЭ Guptara told Matters India. The background to the list is that India seems to be locked in a battle between regressive forces that would like to subvert and replace the values of the Constitution to take people into a future that will be bad for most people in the country but good for tiny elite тАУ as one can already see, he explained. тАЬThe list is meant to honour those who have been eminent in the struggle for taking forward the values of the Constitution тАУ irrespective of their sphere of work, their religion (or lack of it), their political viewpoint (if they have one), or which region or city they come from,тАЭ said Guptara. The list is an open one тАУ in the sense that anyone else can suggest anyone who one thinks deserves inclusion but is not included here; equally, one can write and question the inclusion of anyone who is on the list, he said. тАЬSuch a list of Heroes of our Constitution did not exist, so we felt we ought to create one,тАЭ he added. It was launched with the start of the imprint, Pippa Rann Books, on August 1. Explaining the method or process of listing people into the list, Guptara said, тАЬPeople come to our attention or are brought to our attention, and there is a simple assessment of what their contribution is or has been. If we feel it has been significant enough, we include them.тАЭ тАЬAt present, we are probably being too inclusive, but we feel that it is better to recognize what people have done rather than leave them out if their contribution is at least on the border of being eminent,тАЭ he added. Pippa Rann Books & Media is an imprint of Salt Desert Media Group Limited, which was founded in 2019. It is a member of the Independent Publishers Guild, and is dedicated to publishing material, in print as well as in other media, which nurtures humane values around the world. Guptara started Pippa Rann Books & Media in memory of his wife, Philippa Mary Guptara (nee Rann), and out of his retirement savings, to focus entirely and exclusively on nurturing the values of democracy, liberty, equality and fraternity among Indians тАУ as well as among others who love India. It publishes a variety of books. Its first book was stomach-achingly funny political satire, тАЬPolyTicks, DeMocKrazy & Mumbo Jumbo: Babus, Mantris & Netas (Un)Making Our Nation.тАЭ Its second book, тАЬSeeking God, Seeking Moksha: The Teachings of Shri Krishna and Jesus ChristтАЭ is unique in that it puts the two teachings on parallel pages, organised by topic, in numbered points, so that one can see the similarities for oneself. In general, it publishes books and media by authors of Indian origin, on any subject that serves the purpose mentioned above тАУ broadly interpreted. Books and media by authors of non-Indian origin, on any subject connected with India or with the Indian diaspora, which serves the purpose mentioned above тАУ again, broadly interpreted. Matters India strives to be a platform to tell stories of church and society for Indians to think and act beyond their regional, linguistic, ritual, and caste differences and to enable them to see the goodness in others irrespective of their faiths.

BhukkalтАЩs 14-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter died in May and August respectively. These deaths were also said to have been caused by hunger. These incidents had come to light months after the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal government led by Hemant Soren came to power. During the Bharatiya Janata Party rule in Jharkhand and in the run up to the assembly elections, Soren and his allies had raised the issue of starvation and malnutrition, and used it to their advantage during the election campaign. But now, in power, the Soren-led government has refused to accept that Ghansi and his two children had died due to a lack of food. Not just that, the Soren-led state government also claims that тАЬthere have been no such casualties in the state in the past five yearsтАЭ. The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance came to power only in December 2019. In response to question by BJP MLAs Amit Kumar Mandal and Amar Bauri, Food Minister Rameshwar Oraon denied that the three had died due to a lack of food. тАЬAs per the letters of Deputy Commissioner of BokaroтАжBhukkhal Ghasi aur uske do bacche ki maut bhook se nahi hokar bimari se hui (Bhukkhal Ghansi and his two children did not die due to hunger, but due to illness).тАЭ he said. тАЬAs per the letters, Bhukkhal GhansiтАЩs daughter Rakhi Kumari was affected by some genetic disease, and after hospitalisation, she would get better, but become ill again. She died on 31 August. GhansiтАЩs son also died during his treatment..and it was a case of illness too,тАЭ the minister added. However, reports from the ground tell a different story. GhansiтАЩs family, reports say, did not have a ration card. The family had applied for it on 12 July 2019 but the approval for it came only on 11 March 2020, five days after Ghansi died. тАЬIn the four days leading to GhansiтАЩs death, they did not cook anything,тАЭ an Indian Express report from March says, citing his wife Rekha. According to the Jharkhand State Food Commission, a statutory body for monitoring implementation of National Food Security Act, the family is suffering from ""chronic illnessтАЭ. Members of the commission had visited the family. тАЬThe Civil Surgeon in the visiting team measured the BMI of every member of the family which was less than the recommended value. It seems that the family is suffering from тАШchronic hungerтАЩ,тАЭ the commissionтАЩs report has said. As per Asharfi Nand Prasad, Right to Food Campaign convener in Jharkhand, their fact-finding report found that the family was suffering from тАЬmalnutritionтАЭ. Bokaro District Commissioner Mukesh Kumar had questioned these claims in March. тАЬThey are saying they had not eaten for BhukkhalтАЩs last four days (sic), though the daughter and sons say they had eaten in that time. The sons earn enough money to buy food. There are several inconsistenciesтАж This does not seem to be a case of hunger death,тАЭ he had been quoted by the Express as saying. тАЬAbout why no post-mortem had been done, which is required as per protocol, Kumar says the villagers cremated the body quickly,тАЭ the Express report says.

Her tongue was cut off and her spinal cord and neck were damaged because she was strangled with her chunni. Four accused have reportedly been arrested in connection with the incident. The incident took place on 14 September. Following the incident, three accused were arrested after the woman regained consciousness in an Aligarh hospital on 23 September and gave her statement to the police. The fourth accused was arrested on 26 September, Hathras SP Vikrant Vir confirmed. тАЬMy mother, sister and elder brother had gone to a field to get some grass. My brother went home earlier with a large bundle of grass, while my mother and sister continued to cut them. There was bajra crop on either side of where they were. Soon, both women became a little distant from each other. Four-five people came from behind, they threw my sisterтАЩs dupatta around her neck and dragged her inside the bajra field,тАЭ the womanтАЩs brother told NDTV. тАЬMy mother realised she was missing and went looking for her.

Although historically as well as in contemporary times, these voices have been shunned repeatedly to maintain status quos and casteist forms of oppression, we cannot and must not let history repeat itself. Rather, as people with relative social mobility, we must contribute in the upliftment of the oppressed groups by amplifying their demands, their experiences of subjugation, their histories, solidarities, cultures, biographies, work and much more. The Blue Club, a grassroots media organisation by and for the marginalised, run by Priyadharsini, is committed to magnifying Dalit womenтАЩs voices and provides filmmaking mentorship. Priyadharsini is an independent filmmaker. She graduated from the Asian College of Journalism and is also an aeronautical engineer. Having worked with several media outlets, including India Today, she now does independent filmmaking full-time. She is also a guest lecturer at the Quaide-Milleth International Academy of Media Studies (QIAMS). As the voices of the marginalised continue to be subdued by authorities of power, it is now more than ever that the country needs voices from these communities to speak up against brahminical patriarchy and speak for equality and social justice. Although historically as well as in contemporary times, these voices have been shunned repeatedly to maintain status quos and casteist forms of oppression, we cannot and must not let history repeat itself. The Blue Club is proud to launch its unique fellowship for Dalit Women+Dalit Queer Writers this 13th September, 2020. The fellowshipтАЩs core vision is to strengthen the narratives of Dalit women and Dalit LGBTQIA persons in journalistic media. This, we believe, is essential to challenge the oppressive authority of both the privileged savarna voices in the general media space and the patriarchal gaze within anti-caste media spaces. Reflecting the core values of The Blue Club, the fellowship will be a safe space for Dalit Women+Dalit Queer persons to critically engage with several issues through an anti-casteist feminist lens. While the fellowship involves intensive training, we believe in compassionate and enabling approaches to support the fellows through mentoring, especially mindful of the fact that the process will be online due to the pandemic. Also read: Dalit Women Learn Differently: Experiences In Educational Institutions The fellowship is scheduled to run through November 2020 to January 2021, during which period the fellows will be attending online workshop and lecture series on various topics pertaining to caste and gender plus their interactions with socio-political realms in our country, from media to education, law, work, environment, and so on. They will be trained to write and publish journalistic articles, news reports, opinion pieces on these issues while also receiving one-on-one mentoring from experienced writers.

While the fellowship involves intensive training, we believe in compassionate and enabling approaches to support the fellows through mentoring, especially mindful of the fact that the process will be online due to the pandemic. So, if you are a Dalit woman or a Dalit queer person who wishes to meet and engage with a variety of journalists, writers, experts and social activists across several fields, who is keen to learn and write, or is tired of the limits of what savarnas and men write even in radical spaces, and is looking for an enabling sisterhood that makes you feel belonged, then we strongly encourage you to apply. As the motive of the fellowship is to enable and nurture unrecognised talent among Dalit Women+Dalit Queer persons, we encourage applicants with minimal or no publishing experience; a keenness to learn, engage and dedicate considerable time towards writing about the multilayered oppressions in our society is essential. Moreover, the fellows will be receiving a stipend of Rs. 30,000 for the period of the three-month fellowship.

Ang Madad Foundation, a NGO based in Bhagalpur, Bihar, September 8 announced the awards to be given at the end of September. Lenin Raghuvanshi and Shruti Nagvanshi are the cofounders of the PeopleтАЩs Vigilance Committee on Human Rights (PVCHR), a Varanasi-based NGO that works for the rights of Dalits for the last 25 years. They will receive the awards under the social work category. Nagvanshi is engaged in the welfare of Dalit and underprivileged women. She will be honored with the Tilka Manjhi National Award for her contribution. Raghuvanshi is selected for giving Dalit and deprived their rights in Varanasi. Tilka Manjhi is considered the first freedom fighter of India against the British. тАЬIt is a great honor to receive an award. I feel more joy due to recognizing my grassroots work for Dalits, women and marginalized,тАЭ Nagvanshi, a managing trustee of PVCHR, told Matters India on September 9. тАЬIt is a wonderful moment amid a tough time of Covid-19 pandemic that my co-founder and life partner Lenin and I received the same award for our work,тАЭ she added. Manjhi was the first Adivasi leader who took up arms against the British in 1784, around 70 years before Mangal Pandey (an Indian soldier who played a key part in the events immediately preceding the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857). Manjhi organized the Adivasis to form an armed group to fight against the resource grabbing and exploitation of the British. тАЬToday I am feeling proud and joy to receive the Tilaka Manjhi National award with Shruti. Thanks to the award selection committee,тАЭ Raghuvanshi, CEO of PVCHR said. Both Raghuvanshi and Nagvanshi have received several awards in the past for championing the rights of Dalits, women and marginalized groups through their organization, PVCHR which was e established in 1996. The award consists of a plaque to each. This year award ceremony is going to be held a virtual ceremony in the last week of September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ang Madad Foundation initiated Tilaka Manjhi Rashtriya Samman (Tilaka Manjhi national award) seven years ago. People from art, sport, literature, social work, and journalism will be receiving an award every year. Other prominent awardees are Ms. Divya Niar (USA), Lorena Julio (human Rights activist of Argentina), Gandhian Manoj Meeta and law expert and Gandhian Suad Jamal and others. Established in 2013, Ang Madad Foundation, NGO, in the areas of education, rural development, healthcare, arts and culture, and destitute care. Its mission is to work in remote regions of several states in India including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi NCR, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize Author тАУ Preeti Koli Amidst the pandemic a lot of chaos has been happening simultaneously. Rules and regulations have been scrapped or amended overnight. Students are the most affected during the CoronaVirus pandemic. From taking the online classes to paying for their own education, they have been struggling a lot and more so students belonging to marginalized sections of society. Higher education is still inaccessible to a lot of students coming from marginalized sections which leads to their under representation in the education sector even in the 21st century modern and neo-liberal world. The full fee waiver policy given to SC/ST/PwD candidates is proposed to be scrapped according to the new rules at Ambedkar University, Delhi and it will be diluted under the income slab from this session onwards i.e., 2020-21. Full fee waiver is a major feature of the Ambedkar University, Delhi and it is one of the very few Indian universities that provide 100% fee exemption to SC/ST/PwD students. It should be noted that full fee waiver immediately came into effect from 2016 on the ideals of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Recently, a case of my sisterтАЩs admission raises a several questions on the same, self written testimony of which is as follows: тАЬI am a PhD student at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University, Delhi (AUD) belongs to the Scheduled Caste community and I am availing fee waiver since my admission under the provision of fee waiver policy provided to SC/ST/PwD students. This was the same reason why my sister applied to the program this year at AUD. The fee waiver policy was clearly mentioned at the time of application on the university website and on the MBA Leaflet 2020 as well. My sister took the entrance for the same and got selected under the same category as mentioned in the First MBA Provisional list on 14th August. After she got selected, her registration portal on 18th August was showing a full fee payment option for which we contacted the School of Business, Public Policy and Social Entrepreneurship (SBPPSE) to clarify the same and they verbally told us that there have been some changes in rules and now students belonging to SC/ST/PwD canтАЩt avail full fee waiver from this session, they have to now provide income certificate in order to avail the same. There was no written notice anywhere for the same. The last date to submit the fee was 25th August. We were denied admission because we were busy inquiring for this process.тАЭ After a protest and a support from the student community of the university on the same matter, Indian express made the news headlines on 6th September, 2020. On inquiring more, it came to the forefront that the university was actually planning to scrap the full fee waiver policy, the notice of which was officially to be proposed on 8th September. There is a dissent among the student community against the dilution of full fee waiver policy under income slab. Authorities are taking advantage of the opportunity by implementing such rules during the time of ongoing crisis, limiting the students by taking away their right to protest and render students helpless. A systematic strategy is taking place that can easily be seen in college and universities because during the time of application there was a mention of full fee-waiver while post-admission they asked for fee. University remained silent on the matter as they were clearly waiting for 8th September to announce it publicly. This particular issue is of a special concern to me as I am a PhD scholar of education and I am working on the topic of education among dalit girls. I was not aware that my study for the topic would begin as soon as I was admitted to the university and chose to study the topic that I encounter with, on a daily basis. I am reading a lot of articles around the issue of the caste system for my PhD, especially on the intersections of gender and caste. One of the paper by Vandana Singh (2019) caught my attention in context of Dalit girls and the problems they face in order to pursue higher education. Since, there is an under representation of dalit girls in higher education and higher education is only a dream for so many girls hailing from marginalized sections. Hence, full fee waiver policy at Ambedkar University, Delhi have had made it possible for so many Dalit women to represent themselves in higher education. This paves the way for dalit girls to study in college and universities they have only wished for. So many girls along with me are the first generation Dalit Scholars from their families to ever reach this pedestal. But the ongoing politics is limiting the reach of education for those who are already disadvantaged both economically and socially. The census data and other Government surveys already shows a much lower literacy rate among Scheduled Caste Population. If the lower caste families get to educate their children, they put more emphasis on their sonтАЩs education. The problem gets worse for women from scheduled caste community. The conditions are such that completing the basic education becomes a task let alone the higher education and employment opportunities. Singh (2019) noted that in Dalit families, mothers are mostly illiterate and educated fathers build the foundation of education for their children in 21st century, paving a way for their daughters to study. Moreover, in the lower caste families women have to fight and struggle a lot to get quality education. They have to continuously negotiate with the caste and patriarchal structure to access the education. Singh (2019) notes that dalit girls are often interrogated for their need to pursue higher education and sometimes it is seen as an obstruction in their marriage. The full fee waiver policy in such case gives a leisure to dalit woman that they are not denied to study further. It should be marked as one of the major concerns for dalit girls to get educated who have been raised in upwardly mobile families because from the very beginning of their life they understand the importance of education. Singh (2019) again asserts that education proves to be a strong tool for dalit girls to resist oppression where they gain the apprehension about the issue of marginality through the intersections of caste, class and gender. This might also lead to drop out if the full fee waiver policy for existing students on the basis of written notice is discontinued. The university has already made amendments in reservation policy of admissions under which if a student belonging to SC/ST/OBC category has passed qualifying examination from Delhi while their reservation certificate is issued from outside Delhi, then they are not eligible to avail reservation for admissions anymore. They will be considered in the unreserved category in that case. These two significant changes made by the university are merely causing an obstruction and I am afraid that the platform will remain limited yet once again for the students belonging to marginalized sections who wish to aspire to study further.

The тАЬgood dealтАЭ meant a good bargain from the parties, either in office or in the opposition, in terms of seats in a pre-poll alliance, and share in the government. In return, the transfer of caste and community votes was promised. This politics of negotiation in Bihar proceeded from the period that Kanshi Ram diagnosed as the chamcha age of Dalit politics. In the post-Independence decades, Dalit leaders in the Congress and Janata Party got to share power as representatives of a caste or community. Dalit leaders such as Bhola Paswan Shastri and Ram Sundar Das rose from the grass roots to become chief ministers in Bihar. Both Shastri and Das belonged to mainstream national parties. However, Dalit politicians, who were working in national parties, started to form caste-based parties after the 1980s. The phase of social justice politics in Bihar gave these leaders the capacity and space to float their outfits and, thereby, negotiate better bargains with bigger parties. For instance, Ram Vilas Paswan, who was a leading figure in the anti-Emergency movement and the Janata, founded his own party тАФ the Lok Janshakti Party тАФ in 2000. As Mahadalit politics found resonance in recent years, leaders like Jitan Ram Manjhi, a member of the most marginalised Musahar caste, split from the Janata Dal (United) to form the Hindustani Awam Morcha. However, these parties have not shown any allegiance to ideology тАФ they have effortlessly moved from the NDA to UPA and vice versa to bargain for a better share of seats or ministerial berths. Never have these parties left an alliance or joined one on matters of Dalit empowerment or emancipation. Unlike in UP, Dalit politics in Bihar continue to be dependent on mainstream parties. The Ambedkarite radical consciousness is weaker in the Dalit politics of Bihar and Dalit assertion at the grass roots continues to be weak. The Naxalite movement, which attracted a large number of landless peasants, was the vehicle of Dalit assertion till the 1980s, but the rise of caste and social justice politics led to its marginalisation. The new middle- and upper-class Dalits wedded the slogan of social justice with reservation and employment. This too weakened the Naxalite and communist mobilisations, which were focussed on the issue of land. Opinion | SY Quraishi writes: In Bihar, ECтАЩs challenge: To ensure level playing field in a mostly virtual campaign Another feature of Dalit politics in Bihar is that only the numerically stronger groups among the 22 Dalit castes have become influencers in politics. They alone managed to get representation in government. Dalits constitute about 16 per cent of the stateтАЩs population. But only the Dusadh, Chamar, Dhobi, Mushahar communities are visible in power politics. The Dusadhs account for 5-6 per cent of the total population of the state and make up 37 per cent of the Dalit population. Chamars are around 6-7 per cent of the state population and form 39 per cent of the total Dalit population. The Mahadalit castes (19 castes) together are around 4-5 per cent of the state population and are 24 per cent of the Dalits. Musahar, the largest politically-mobilised Mahadalit caste, gained a voice during the Lalu Prasad years. Other Mahadalit castes are numerically small and yet to find visibility in electoral politics. Most of the Dalit leaders of Bihar command support of only their caste and subcaste members. Leaders such as Ram Vilas Paswan, Shyam Rajak and Jitan Ram Manjhi claim that they can transfer votes of their caste. Recently, Rajak, industry minister in the Nitish Kumar government, joined the RJD while Manjhi has moved away from the UPA. Chirag Paswan is putting pressure on the NDA leadership for more seats in the upcoming assembly election. However, previous poll results indicate that these leaders cannot transfer more than 40 per cent of caste votes. At his peak, Ram Vilas Paswan commanded 50 per cent. If these leaders still command political traction, it is because they help the alliance project the perception that it supports the social justice agenda. Also read | Explained: What the EC has said on voting during the Covid-19 pandemic These leaders have also failed to disseminate democratic ideals within their communities and behave like feudal leaders, almost copies of leaders of dominant communities and parties. Their failure in creating emancipatory conditions for marginal communities has led to the fragmentation of Dalit votes, which in turn has weakened Dalit assertion in Bihar.

"634",5800,"https://catholicherald.co.uk/discrimination-against-dalit-catholics-threatens-to-split-indian-church/","Discrimination against Dalit Catholics threatens to split Indian Church - Catholic Herald","Dalit Catholics in India have appealed to the Vatican to end the enduring legacy of the caste system on the Indian Church. During a national online conference held on Saturday, Church leaders from the Dalit communities called for the appointment of more Dalit priests to the episcopacy. Dalit, a Sanskrit word for тАЬtrampled uponтАЭ, refers to those formerly considered untouchable who were part of the lowest caste in Hindu society, many of whom consequently left Hinduism and converted to Christianity. Conference speakers noted that there are currently four Cardinals in India and a further 31 Archbishops, but none are from a Dalit background, despite Dalits making up over 80 per cent of Indian Catholics. Of the over 180 Catholic bishops in India, only 11 are from the former untouchable communities. The All-India Catholic Union (AICU) said that whilst Dalits are well represented in Sikhism and Buddhism, they have been kept out of leadership positions in the Indian Catholic Church. Part of the reason for this, they argued, is that Dalit Christians are not protected as castes under the Indian Reservation policy. This policy abolished untouchability in 1950 and established a system of affirmative action that would ensure Hindu Dalits (тАЬHarijansтАЭ) were granted a representative quota of governmental jobs, including seats in Parliament. The policy was expanded to include Sikhism and Buddhism, but Christian Dalits and Muslim Dalits were never granted such access, supposedly on the grounds that these faiths were more egalitarian. AICU national president Lancy D Cunha said that the exclusion of Dalit Christins has deprived тАЬa large number of people of their political rights, and their children of the opportunities of reservations in professional institutions.тАЭ Franklin Caesar Thomas, coordinator of the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC), however, said that the Indian Catholic Church itself needed to overcome its тАЬcasteistтАЭ tendencies or risk Dalit Christians starting a new Indian Church. Speaking to UCA News, Thomas said: тАЬIf the Vatican does not immediately remove the discriminatory process of bishop selection that neglects qualified Dalit priests, we could announce our own Indian Dalit Catholic Church or the Indian Dalit Catholic Rite.тАЭ  This page is available to subscribers.

He added that though India is struggling through a pandemic, these entrepreneurs have cumulatively earned over Rs 5 crore in the first five months of the lockdown period. Bharti underlined that the aim of their programme, being run in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services, is to bridge the digital divide between the rural and urban India.тАЬThe task was to impart functional literacy of computers among the educated youth [belonging to socially disadvantaged groups], who could then be incentivised into teaching,тАЭ he said. Meera Ahirwar, 25, a resident of Gor Gai village in Madhya PradeshтАЩs Chhatarpur district, was given training in digital skills. In return, she has to impart the skills to the students of her village government school. SheтАЩd be given a stipend for this. With a postgraduate degree in Geography and a bachelorтАЩs degree in Education, she would find it difficult to secure a job as she belonged to the Dalit community. She would even have to face casteist taunts en route to the local school she taught at. She quickly learned to execute various digital tasks like online banking, utility bill payment and extending benefits of various government schemes through the internet. This enabled her to set up her own kiosk in 2019. Now, she helps people make transactions, apply for scholarships and other schemes. During the pandemic, when banking facilities were hampered because of the lockdown, AhirwarтАЩs kiosk attracted people from even far off villages. тАЬMigrant workers who were stuck in different parts of the country during the lockdown were able to transfer money to their family members in the villages through e-payment,тАЭ she told 101Reporters. She said she also helped people procure e-passes, which were necessary for inter-city or interstate movement during the lockdown. Even the upper-caste villagers who used to mock her and not avail of her kiosk would now seek her help as all the other internet access points near the village were closed owing to the lockdown. тАЬInitially, they would make sure that they would maintain as much distance as possible while interacting with us in our shop, but gradually the distance blurred,тАЭ underlined Ahirwar. The increased transactions during the lockdown period bumped up earning of many entrepreneurs, and it has helped them expand their business. Lifeline for villages Ujwal Mondal, 31, a resident of West BengalтАЩs North 24 Parganas district, earned Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh each month from his three shops in Hingalganj block during the lockdown. He recently received a tender from the state government to register the people eligible for Samajik Suraksha Yojna, a scheme that provides provident fund to the workers in the unorganised sector. тАЬI have to go to each house in the village and find out the people who are eligible for the scheme. After that I register their names online by filling a form,тАЭ stated Mondal, adding that about 75 people visit his kiosks every day. Mondal mentioned that people visit him to make changes in their Aadhaar cards and seek help in obtaining different certificates like for caste or marriage. Previously, people would have to get it through the village authorities but now they download the forms, get them filled, sign and upload them. There are 21 such entrepreneurs from the three clusters in North 24 Paraganas district. One of the cluster leaders Subarna Mondal mentioned that though their business was affected at the start of the lockdown, it picked up within 15-20 days when people realised the potential of online transactions. тАЬPeople who had never done an online transaction in their lives came looking for us to withdraw cash from their accounts,тАЭ she added. In addition, Mondal said the entrepreneurs also helped fill up forms of the people who were entitled to cash support under various central and state government assistance programs. When the money for Ujjwala Yojna, PM Kisan Yojana and several other state government schemes, including financial assistance for the Amphan Cyclone, came into the account of the beneficiaries, they came to our kiosks to withdraw the money, she added. Interventions such as the digital literacy drive have come as a relief not only for the ones receiving the training but also for the society they live in, connecting many with the world wide web.   101Reporters #1886, 2nd Floor, 8th Cross, 4th Main, New Thippasandra, Bangalore, Karnataka, India - 560075+91 73491 28853 | [email protected] Copyright ┬й2021 Off Road Media Pvt Ltd","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

The victim died on Tuesday in DelhiтАЩs Safdarjung Hospital, two weeks being allegedly gang-raped and tortured in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Hathras area. She underwent numerous fractures and paralysis, her tongue was horrifyingly cut off, along with several assaults. Long after her death, her family had to suffer a night of interminable horror. A very distressing series of events was caught in overnight pictures, where the victim was allegedly cremated by policemen and her family and relatives were locked-up in their homes. The visuals showed that the victimтАЩs family was arguing with cops and female relatives were throwing themselves on the ambulance that was carrying the body. The mother was helplessly weeping as cops insisted on taking her daughter straight for cremation, without even allowing them a last look. Soon after that, many protesters chanted тАЬhang the rapistsтАЬ, outside the Delhi hospital and the victimтАЩs brothers complained that her body had been taken away by the UP police. Even the victimтАЩs father and brothers protested but they were allegedly taken away by the UP cops in a black Scorpio with UP plates. The victimтАЩs father said, тАЬWe wanted the last rites to be performed according to the Hindu traditions. Despite our protests, the cremation was performed. They took the body forcefully. We couldnтАЩt see our daughterтАЩs face for the last time.тАЭ He also pleaded with the police to be permitted to take her home and cremate her in the morning but they didnтАЩt allow this. After midnight, the victimтАЩs body was taken to her village in Hathras. Reportedly, many appeals were also made to the District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar, to take her body home for last rights, after daybreak. At around 2:30 AM, while most of her family was home, the police cremated the body. All the four alleged attackers who are reportedly тАШupper casteтАЩ men from the victimтАЩs village are in jail and will also be charged with murder. The UP police are under inspection over alleged breaks throughout the case. It was initially registered as an attempted murder case; later, they added the rape charges, only after the victimтАЩs formal proclamation. After the death of the victim, IPC section 302 (punishment for murder) has also been invoked, said that police, furthering that under the SC/ST Act, the victimтАЩs family has been given monetary compensation of Rs 10 lakh. However, in a press conference, IG Piyush Mordiya said that the medical examination of the victim did not confirm rape. He also added that the details have been sent to the forensic science lab in Agra for more examination and the results are expected any time soon confirmed the IG. On September 14th 2020, the victim went to the field to gather fodder. Then a group of men attacked her from behind, and she was allegedly dragged by a dupatta around her neck that caused the spinal injuries, to a field where she was allegedly raped. The station house officer (SHO) of Chandpa police station in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Hathras district, under whose jurisdiction the Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped, has been transferred to the district police lines for his тАЬfailure to promptly actтАЭ. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted and demanded that the guilty be tried and hanged at the earliest. тАЬThe death of Hathras victim is shameful for the entire society, country as well as for all the governments. It is highly sad that so many daughters are being sexually assaulted and we have not been able to protect them.тАЭ Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said on Twitter, тАЬA Dalit girl who was a victim of demoniac behaviour in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital.

Photo: VIKHAR AHMED SAYEED Senior Ministers in the B.S. Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka, including Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chauhan, have stated that the government intends to introduce a Bill banning bovine slaughter in the State in the ongoing monsoon session of the legislature. The proposed Bill seeks to amend the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, 1964. In a statement, Prabhu Chauhan said that the proposed Bill would have more stringent provisions than the 2010 Bill which was passed in the State Legislative Assembly during the Chief Ministership of B.S. Yediyurappa but was not implemented by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government that came to power in 2013. The issue has repeatedly figured in the BJP election manifesto. In a press conference on Thursday, representatives of leading farmer and Dalit organisations strongly opposed any move towards introducing this Bill. J.M. Veerasangaiah, working president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, said the Bill тАЬshould not be tabledтАЭ. He added, тАЬYediyurappa had tried to bring this law even in 2010 but did not succeed because of opposition from the farming community. The farming community is suffering severe economic hardship in the State because of the pandemic. The sale of aged cows, bullocks and buffaloes allows a farmer to alleviate his dire situation slightly and this law will even prevent that. Somehow, the BJPтАЩs ideology wants us to feel that vegetarianism is supreme whereas non-vegetarianism is bad, but how will the poor, Dalits and religious minorities get nutritional food without beef?тАЭ The State president of the Samata Sainik Dal, B. Channakrishnappa said, тАЬThe BJP has a hidden agenda against Dalits, farmers and religious minorities with this proposed Bill. I demand that why only cow slaughter, even the slaughter of sheep, chicken and pigs should be banned. DonтАЩt they say that the boar is an avatar of Vishnu? We live in a democracy. We have the freedom to eat what we want. Instead of focusing on development during a pandemic, the BJP is amending farming and labour laws and is now targeting the poor with this Bill.тАЭ R. Mohan Raj, State convener of the Dalit Sangharsh Samiti, stated, тАЬFood culture is unique and the Constitution gives everyone the right to eat whatever they want. This anti-peopleтАЩs Bill should not be tabled. Have we ever told Yediyurappa not to eat puliyogare (tamarind rice)? That is his choice. They [the BJP] show that they are targeting Muslims, but their real target is Dalits.тАЭ","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

Metal fence installed across Dalit family's property by villagers","Chennai: An incident that has proved that evils like casteism still exist in the India society came to light from the Dharmapuri city of Tamil Nadu. A metal fence was allegedly installed around the property owned by a Dalit family by members of the upper caste of the village. The incident took place on Saturday morning when Arjunan, who owns six acres of agricultural property noticed that a fence had been put up around the land. The fence restricts the entry of tractors and lorries into the property. Allegedly, members of the dominant caste in the village erected the fence as they were miffed at the family's ability to grow crops on their property. Arjunan said that when the fence was being installed, the other family had promised that they would leave space for the movement of vehicles. However, when he woke up on Saturday, he saw that the fence had been erected all around their property. Arjunan told The News Minute, ""We are unable to get out of this land. There is another agricultural land surrounding ours and it is not possible to walk through those. When we questioned the men who erected the fence, they abused us, used casteist slurs and said they will chop our limbs off if we try to leave our property. "" Arjunan's family alleged that they had been facing discrimination for years. Recalling one such incident, Arjunan said that in 2011, his father was asked to fall at the feet of upper-caste villagers as he had made an attempt to buy land owned by them. The tehsildar visited the property on Sunday morning and asked Arjunan to stay within the fence for two days.

Hold Citizens Speciality hospital and all the responsible authorities culpable for criminal medical negligence resulting in the death of Surya Pratap Bharti! On August 17, 2020, Surya Pratap Bharati, a 30-year-old PhD scholar from the Department of English, University of Hyderabad, after having suffered an acute ischemic stroke, was rushed by his friends to the тАШCitizens Speciality HospitalтАЩ as referred by the University Health Centre. At the time when he was taken, he retained mild cognitive abilities, that of speech, recognition and other motor functions, even though the left side of this body was paralyzed. Once Surya was admitted to Citizens, the presiding doctor recommended an immediate cerebral surgery after running the diagnosis and tests. Subsequently, all was done and all arrangements were made in accordance with the instructions and demands of the hospital. A Rapid antigen test was run by Citizens hospital in which Surya was tested COVID-19 negative. However, the following day the hospital refused to operate without running a full COVID-19 RTPCR Test. Thus, on August 18, the sample for RTPCR test was collected. In the duration of the next 24 hours that followed, Surya was kept in the Isolation Ward and his friends/points of contact were kept in the dark about the treatment and the prognosis and were not even allowed to visit him. Finally, the next day, that is, the August 19, Citizens Speciality hospital declared that Surya had tested positive for the Novel Corona Pathogen and consequently denied any further treatment. A bill of 56 thousand INR was presented by the hospital on the first account, however, they later kept haggling for 86 thousand INR, as Surya seemingly did not qualify the terms and conditions of the insurance (according to the insurance claim desk at Citizens). Precious time was wasted in this commotion, time that was of critical importance. In the meanwhile, an anxious friend who had slipped into the Isolation ward found Surya convulsing and immediately informed the doctors. By this time SuryaтАЩs cognitive functions had taken a hit, his overall health condition deteriorated insomuch that he had to be put on ventilator support, for 2 hours of which the total bill was rounded off to around 1.57 lakhs INR as opposed to the previously mentioned 1.12 lakhs INR. Ruckus followed over the exorbitant and capricious billing. The hospital reception maintained that since Surya is not enrolled, (despite still being a registered student in the university) hence the 40% rise in the total payable and only after a lot of deliberation did Citizens Speciality reception settle for the previously agreed 1.12 lakhs INR. Arrangements were made and Surya was immediately shifted to the Continental Hospital, where the doctors told his friends and family that Surya had only a very slim chance of survival since the damage was irreversible. In the next several hours that followed, he developed edema and multiple organ failures. Finally at 9:30 A.M, on August 20, 2020, Surya was declared brain dead before succumbing to his ischemic clots on August 21, 2020 at 4:11 PM. Was it not the negligence and criminal dereliction of duty on the part of Citizens Speciality Hospital that led to the tragic end of an inspiring life that held out hope to many? His points of contact who were rather wary of the result of the COVID-19 test run at Citizens had already applied for an RTPCR test at Continental and the test results showed the Surya had not contracted the virus. Moreover, a third RTPCR test, to reassess the previous RTPCR, confirmed that Surya was COVID-19 negative. Lest there be any room left for doubt over SuryaтАЩs test results at Citizens Speciality Hospital, another Antibody (IgA, IgG, IgM) test from Continental Hospital detected Surya non-reactive effectively corroborating he could not have contracted the C19 virus anytime in the past week. This establishes beyond doubt the criminal magnitude of the negligence and recklessness on part of citizens hospital that cost Surya his life. Also, the erroneous result of the RTPCR test conducted by Citizens Hospital, wherein Surya had tested COVID-19 positive, created considerable panic and concern among his attendants, friends and family. тАЬSince Citizens Hospital already had a protocol regarding the non-admittance of COVID-19 patients and since they also knew that SuryaтАЩs case was an emergency and that he was in a critical condition that needed immediate surgery, they shouldnтАЩt have admitted Surya, in the first place and asked him to be taken to a different hospitalтАЭ, said Faizan, a PhD scholar from MANU, an AISA activist and a close friend to Surya. He also added, тАЬHowever Citizens recklessly went ahead and admitted him and kept him in their facility for over 24 hours without any proper treatment, which proved fatal for my friend. The Hospital had kept us in the dark regarding both their protocols and the treatment.тАЭ Such negligence, apathy and sheer unprofessionalism are a shameless violation of societal protocols and the Hippocratic Oath that binds all healthcare workers. Coming from a marginalized (Dalit) section of the society, Surya was a first-generation learner and braved many odds to carve his place in academia. Surya was an eminent scholar and a substantial presence in various student movements for social justice. His parents who are daily wage labourers and a brother, a migrant labourer in Mumbai harboured high hopes on him and his bright future could have been a ministration for the rehabilitation of his community and class. Should such negligence to liability, tantamount to murder, go unpunished it would be a blemish on the democratic machinery of the country? His friends and family have demanded a fair, independent and thorough investigation into the issue. The tragic demise of Surya Pratap Bharti could have been avoided with adequate medical intervention and proactive response by the hospital authorities. Citizens Speciality hospitalтАЩs criminal negligence apart, SuryaтАЩs case foregrounds the consequences of the lack of quality and affordable public health care system. With the government investment in public health less than 1.5% of the GDP, the state of public health care in India, is abysmal, to say the least. The pandemic has further clearly shown how unaffordable and alienating the health care system in India is for the disadvantaged and marginalized sections of the society. In a landmark Supreme Court judgement, Paschim Bangal Khet Mazdoor Samity vs State of West Bengal (1996), the Supreme Court upheld the right of any seriously ill to get hospitalization for life-saving medical aid at any government hospital. However, the grim reality of Indian public healthcare system is such that it is grossly understaffed and operates with deplorable technological and logistical infrastructure and medical equipment. Although Article 21 ensures the right to life, problems persist, one, of the fact that it only applies to government healthcare facilities, which often prove counterproductive in emergency medicare. It is shameful that we do not have any systematically enforced mechanism to provide affordable health care to the most socio-economically disadvantaged sections of our society and that a scholar, who had bravely crossed so many social and economic barriers to pursue a doctorate from one of the countryтАЩs finest institutions with a scholarship had to fall prey to the criminal medical negligence of a private hospital. Besides, most private hospitals charge arbitrarily since the states do not practice standing authority to standardize medical prices and rates. It is as if indifference has been institutionalized. The governmentтАЩs policy of manic privatisation across all sectors, disastrous as they are, in the education and public health sector, in particular, would toll the death knell for social justice in our society. This tragedy is a case in point. The corona virus pandemic has only exposed the rampant negligence, corruption and inadequacy present in Indian healthcare system that has always been present even prior to COVID тАУ 19.

Kalpana SarojтАЩs story is one that needs to be told to give enough motivation for the people who are feeling low. Hailing from Murtizapura, a hamlet in the interiors of Maharashtra and being born in a low caste Dalit family, she has had her shares of agony and misfortune. But she was one of the rare individuals, who by her sheer hard luck and perseverance, managed to turn the tables around. Today, she is the owner of six companies with a combined turnover of over Rs 2,000 crore. Even though her father allowed her to get an education, wider family pressures saw Kalpana was married at the age of 12. It is worth mentioning here that despite all such difficulties and challenges, she touched the pinnacle of success. She moved to Mumbai to be with her husband who was 10 years older, but was shocked to find herself living in a slum. But that was not the only hardship she had to endure. Kalpana faced many challenges in her life and defied all odds to become a brave woman. She even tried to commit suicide, but survived. At that moment, she decided that she would achieve something, and live life on her terms. She made up her mind to do something big in her life. She returned to Mumbai a few years later and stayed with an uncle. Working in a hosiery company, she was earning only Rs 2 a day. But it was in the rough and tumble of MumbaiтАЩs underbelly that she acquired her raw aggression, determination and earthy approach to conducting business. PADMASHRI & NARI SHAKTI AWARDEE KALPANA SAROJ JI who is the epitome of woman empowerment and entrepreneurship has been selected for the BHARAT GAURAV AWARD this year.(2019)..#inspiration #motivation #courage #happiness #awards #womanpower #goodwork pic.twitter.com/dWG2qw6cAQ In a few months, she also started stitching on the side and added an income of Rs 100. тАЬI saw Rs 100 note for the first timeтАж And I had earned it!тАЭ she says. Within two years she had saved up a decent sum of money to rent a small house in Kalyan East and shifted her family in with her. In 1975, Kalpana got a loan of Rs 50,000 under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Scheme тАУ a government scheme for backward classes тАУ and started a clothes boutique in Kalyan. On the side she started re-selling furniture. тАЬMy father started looking after the furniture business and my younger sister took over the boutique,тАЭ says Kalpana. Things continued in an upward swing and Kalpana made a comfortable life for herself and her family. The next big shift in her income came only two decades later. In 1995, Kalpana came across a man who wanted to sell his land to her as he was in urgent need of Rs 2.5 lakh. Kalpana agreed to buy his property and offered him only Rs 1 lakh. Later, Kalpana realised why he had sold it so cheap: the land was under litigation. тАЬI didnтАЩt know anything about land deals till then,тАЭ explains Kalpana. тАЬBut I met the district collector who helped me to sort out things, and in two years I got permission to sell the land.тАЭ Kalpana Saroj, a Dalit girl who at a time used to work for Rs 2, today lives in a 5,000 sq ft house in Kalyan. But if you think she is breathing a big sigh of relief now, then you are wrong. She is now going to invest in a hotel business in Rajasthan. Kalpana is the mother of two children. Her daughter Seema has done a hotel management course and her son Amar is a commercial pilot. Kalpana was awarded the Padma Shri for Trade and Industry in 2013 and was also appointed to the board of directors of Bhartiya Mahila Bank by the Government of India.

According to multiple reports, a 22-year-old dalit teen was abducted on her way to work, and she returned home late, in a state of a daze and injected with an unknown substance. She had stepped out of her home in the village of Majhauli at 10am to go to Pachpherwa to seek admission in a college. The woman also worked for a local NGO. The area falls under the Gaisadi thana. When she did not get back by 4pm, her family members called her cell phone but the call went unanswered. At 8pm, a rickshaw puller dropped off the woman home. Her mother said, тАЬMy child was disabled. Her legs and back were broken. She could neither get up nor speak properly. After some time, she began to complain of extreme discomfort. I kept asking her kya hua, kya hua [what happened]"". The family rushed with her to the district hospital, with a drip attached to her, but she died on the way. The womanтАЩs mother said that two men had injected her with a substance and then taken her to a room. According to the police at 5.30pm, a local youth had asked a doctor to come and treat the woman. When the doctor reached the spot, he found the unconscious woman and refused to treat her till her family was informed. After darkness set in, the man with his accomplice hired a rickshaw to drop the woman back at her home. The rickshaw that brought her home was soaked in blood. Her footwear has also been recovered from the path which the rickshaw took. The womanтАЩs brother has filed a written complaint against two men who have been arrested. Dev Ranjan Verma, the Balrampur Superintendent of Police said that the postmortem did not reveal that the womanтАЩs limbs had been broken. тАЬWe have arrested the accused and will complete our investigations quickly. The case will be tried in a fast track courtтАЭ, he said. Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said, ""After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gangraped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition. Condolences! The BJP government should commit no laxity in this case as was done in Hathras and arrest the accused immediately,"" he added with hashtags #Balrampur and #NoMoreBJP on Twitter. Outrage over Hathras case The incident comes close on the heels of the brutal Hathras gangrape. The victim was raped by four upper caste men on September 14 and referred to Safdarjung Hospital, and subsequently AIIMS, in Delhi with spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. The NHRC had issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh government and the state's police chief in connection to the case. The NHRC observed that the young woman belonging to the Scheduled Caste community was subjected to sexual harassment and brutality. ""It is apparent that the police was not able to take timely action to trace and save the victim due to which she could not be saved from being subjected to grave cruelty,"" it said. ""The way the perpetrators have acted shows that they had no fear of law in their mind. The family has suffered an irrevocable loss. A young and a precious human life has been lost,"" the rights panel added. Not only this, there are also allegations made by the family that the ""police forcibly took away the body of the deceased for cremation"" as have been reported in the media, the statement said. A plea was even moved in the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking directions for handing over the case to the CBI or a Special Investigation Team. Workers of several opposition parties protested in parts of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday against the gangrape. Congress and Balmiki Samaj members clashed with police at several places in Hathras. Reports of stone-pelting and a motorcycle being set ablaze were also received. State Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu led a group of protesters to the chief minister's residence at 5 Kalidas Marg in Lucknow but were stopped by police. Party leader Lalan Kumar said several Congress workers were injured in baton charge by police. ""Lallu was bodily stopped by the policemen, who were deployed in large numbers, and he, along with others, was held and taken to the Eco Garden,"" Kumar said. The Samajwadi party also tried to march to the CM residence but they too were asked to stop and lathicharged, a senior party leader said, accusing the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of ""suppressing the democratic rights"" of opposition parties. -Inputs from agencies ЁЯУг The Week is now on Telegram.

"644",5903,"https://thesite.in/thirst-for-knowledge-turns-whatsapp-group-into-a-coaching-centre-for-dalit-and-muslim-youths","Thirst for knowledge turns WhatsApp group into a coaching centre for Dalit and Muslim youths","By Mohammed Anas, The Site  One of the most interesting outcomes of the global pandemic COVID-19 has been the way social media has stepped up to provide support to children and youths who cannot attend schools and colleges. But for many, social media tools have always been powerful in providing a platform for knowledge distribution. Just ask some youths from Western Uttar Pradesh.  A WhatsApp group which started as a leisure activity has turned into a full-fledged welfare society running a coaching centre. It now provides free science coaching of science subjects to economically weak Muslim and Dalit students in Gangoh town of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, as the coaching classes have halted, the group members are actively supporting those affected by lockdowns because of Covid-19 pandemic.  The group, which was started in 2016 as an initiative to promote scientific knowledge, attracted members from across the country.  The group was named тАЬScientific InventionsтАЭ and it shared information about complex scientific concepts in easy-to-understand methods.    Mustaqeem Chaudhary, one of the group members, said that their group became so popular that people started pressing them to share their knowledge with the students. тАЬAnd we agreed. And thus, a coaching centre imparting free coaching to around 30 students was inaugurated in June 2016 and it continues to this day,тАЭ he told the Site. The admin of the group is Jan Abdullah, an Afghan descendant based in Saudi Arabia.  Since Gangoh town is mostly inhabited by Muslims and Dalits, said Mustaqeem, the coaching also invited students from these two communities.  тАЬChildren from Muslim and Dalit families lag behind in education and they need the educational push the most. We are trying to make up for the void in their lives,тАЭ says Mustaqeem.  Mustaqeem added that the coaching institute building was chosen in the vicinity of Noor Chaudhary Cinema in the town so that both the Hindu and Muslim children can easily visit the institute.  Slowly, the coaching institute run by these enthusiasts became so popular that they decided to form a welfare trust to formally register it. тАЬAnd thus, the Al Khidmat Welfare Trust was born in 2016,тАЭ said Wasil Khan, the secretary of the trust.   The trust collects money from whoever wishes to donate. тАЬWe go door to door to collect money for our trust. People donate from Rs 10 to Rs 10,000, depending on their capacity,тАЭ said Wasil.  Right now, around 104 students are registered for coaching by the trust. тАЬThey belong to Class 8, 9 and 10. We are preparing them for entrance exams of universities like Jamia Millia Islamia and AMU. Besides, we also plan to prepare our students for job-oriented competitive exams like SSC, Banking Recruitment, etc,тАЭ said Mustaqeem.  But, the coaching classes of the institute have come to a halt because of government guidelines in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. So, the trust members have decided to provide relief to those affected by joblessness in the lockdown period.  тАЬWe have been providing food to around 500 people daily. An influential personality of the town, Haji Saleem Quraishi, has provided fund for this relief work. The owner of Naushad Hotel has rented out his kitchen for free to cook food for the needy,тАЭ said Wasil.  There are many Hindus of the town who are associated with the trust. тАЬPeople like Anit Chaudhary, Balbeer Singh Tomar and Lokesh Salarpuri are attached with the trust and keep helping us in one way or the other. Similarly, people like Aneeta Arya, who is a teacher, has helped us to find a suitable and cost-effective place to run our institute. She has also helped find teachers,тАЭ said Wasil.  Despite praiseworthy work of the trust to promote education in the backward town, Wasil and Mustaqeem said, the trust has faced opposition from religious quarters.  тАЬGangoh is famous for being the birthplace of Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi, the founder of Dar-ul-Uloom Deoband seminary, and there is a network of madrasas in the town and its vicinity. People from poor background usually prefer to send their kids to these madrasas. We have tried to bring these kids to mainstream education. And hence, we have been accused of sabotaging cause of madrasas by some maulvis. But we have defied them are determined to move ahead,тАЭ said Mustaqeem.  Mustaqeem added that the trust plans to rent a huge patch of land to build a mini athletics track.  тАЬIt will be to prepare children and youth for the Army and Police recruitment tests where athletics skills are a prerequisite,тАЭ said Mustaqeem.

In connection with the August 15 murder of Niranjan Ram, 20, of Garuda Municipality, police from Garuda Area Police Office had taken seven persons, including Bijaya Ram Chamar, in custody for investigation. However, on August 26, Bijaya died in the course of treatment at National Medical College of Birgunj. Dalit leaders accused the police of murdering the youth in custody by meting out physical torture. This prompted the Dalit community to stage protest against police high-handedness. The agitating Dalit community led by the Niranjan Ram and Bijaya Ram Struggle Committee have been organising various protest programmes from the day after Bijaya├в┬А┬Щs death. Under the leadership of Bahujan Shakti Party central Chairperson and former minister Bisendra Paswan, four persons including Sonalal Paswan and Ramprit Paswan, have been staging a fast-unto-death from Saturday. ├в┬А┬ЬWe won├в┬А┬Щt end the hunger strike until the central government suspends and takes action against SP Rabiraj Khadka, DSP Gyan Kumar Mahato, along with the inspectors, ASIs and head constables involved in torturing the innocent youth to death,├в┬А┬Э said the former minister. ├в┬А┬ЬSimilarly, we need martyrs status for both Niranjan and Bijaya, compensation to the families and job guarantee to at least one person from these families,├в┬А┬Э he added. Meanwhile, though post-mortem on Bijaya├в┬А┬Щs body was conducted in TU Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu on Friday itself, the kin of the deceased have refused to receive the body so far.

After TNM's report on a case of caste discrimination in Dharmapuri district's Pennagaram taluk, DMK MP Dr K Senthilkumar visited the affected Dalit family. He has assured the members of his support and has also helped devise multiple solutions to an ongoing land dispute. The family had woken up on Saturday to discover that caste Hindu neighbours had fenced off their six acre property, closing off the route through which tractors and lorries can enter the land. This was allegedly in continuation of a decade old dispute over the land, made worse by caste factors. Speaking to TNM, the member of Parliament said, ""I listened to both the affected persons and the other party involved in the dispute. This struggle between them has been going for the last 10 years and small issues have been blown out of proportion in the past as well. The affected persons have told me that they have been abused in regard to caste but the other party says that this fencing is not a form of discrimination."" After discussions helped, along with local authorities solutions to the ongoing problem were devised. ""We have given four options to consider. Both parties have said they will think about it and come to a decision. A peace meeting was also held by the tahsildar on Thursday to help them have another round of discussion,"" he says. ""They don't want the matter to be politicised. They are ready to work amicably and come to a solution,"" he adds. Speaking to TNM on Tuesday, Arjunan the owner of the land had said caste based discrimination against his family had increased in the last two years. ├в┬А┬ЬThey threaten us with bodily harm if we leave our property. They are supported by other intermediate castes in the village but we have no one to talk to us,├в┬А┬Э said Arjunan. ├в┬А┬ЬWe need the tractor to begin harvest and the lorry to transport produce.

The umbrella organisation said it has prepared a draft legislation to be submitted to the Centre and will be writing to PM Modi formally within a couple of days. тАЬThe country has been facing a huge job deficit. This has now gone up manifold due to the coronavirus pandemic. It has led to severe distress, demoralisation and even depression in some cases among educated youth throughout the country. In view of this, NACDAOR appeals to the Central Government to enact a law in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament to guarantee employment for the educated youth and in case of its non-availability, a suitable compensation in accordance to their qualification should be extended to them,тАЭ The National Confederation for Dalit and Adivasi Organisations (NACDAOR) urged in a recent statement. According to the recent tally, no less than 14 crore jobs are feared to have been lost in recent months after the coroanavirus outbreak in the country.

Because it is a system that stresses division, I thought I would interview a dear friend who is from a different caste than me to share how we choose to live with reconciliation deep in our hearts!! What is Caste? Caste is an institutionalized spiritual structure of oppression that affects over 1 billion people across the world. At birth, every child inherits his or her ancestorтАЩs caste, through the Hindu varna system, which determines their social status and assigns them тАЬspiritual purityтАЭ. This inherited status can determine where you live, what you eat and who you marry, and even where you can be buried or cremated when you die. It is also referred to as the тАЬHeredity PrincipleтАЭ and Hindus believe it to be eternal. Caste also determines access to opportunities for employment and ownership of resources. Many individuals actively participate in тАЬManual scavengingтАЭ. This is a euphemistic name for the Caste occupation of picking up fecal and other sewage with bare hands, and it is forced onto Dalit communities and continues to still be pervasive across South Asia. Throughout South Asia, there is also a high rate of caste-based violence both physically and sexually. The caste system divides Hindus into four main categories тАУ Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras. Many believe that the groups originated from Brahma, the Hindu God of creation.  Meet my friend My guest today is a dear friend and brother, Mr. Vaibhav Moon. He has an MBA and is the Executive Director at Udhhar (meaning тАЬlifted upтАЭ). Udhhar is a Non-profit organization serving the rag pickers, farmers, tribal and people in crisis in Nagpur, India. As the title of this post suggests we have a friendship and service relationship. My ancestors are from the Brahmin caste and my guest and dear friend was born into the Dalit caste. According to cultural and religious design, the two should never mix or associate. When asked тАЬhow did you choose to work with the rag pickers?тАЭ He said, тАЬI went to them since they believe they canтАЩt come to us because of the caste divisions. My work should lead to reconciliationтАЭ. And that, my friends, is what unites us.  Feel free to contact Vaibhav directly through the Udhhar website or at his personal email listed below.

Published: 29th September 2020 06:22 PM | Last Updated: 29th September 2020 07:47 PM | A+A A- Congress workers protest against the death of Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, who was gang-raped on Sept. 14, at Safderjung hospital in New Delhi. (Photo | Shekhar Yadav) NEW DELHI: Hitting out at the BJP over the Hathras gangrape incident, the Congress Tuesday questioned the ""silence"" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and women leaders of his party, and alleged Uttar Pradesh under the Yogi Adityanath government has become the ""crime capital"" of the country. The Opposition party's attack on the Centre and the state government came after a 19-year-old Dalit woman from Hathras died at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi Tuesday morning, days after she was allegedly raped by four men. The Congress also protested at the Vijay Chowk over the incident, demanding justice for the victim. The party said its leaders PL Punia, Udit Raj, Amrita Dhawan along with other functionaries were detained at Mandir Marg Police station for the protest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the government over the incident, saying the ""class-specific jungle raj"" of UP has killed another young woman. ""The government said that this is fake news and left the victim to die. Neither was this unfortunate incident fake, nor was the death of the victim and the mercilessness of the government,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government, alleging there is ""no semblance of security"" for women in the state. ""A Dalit girl who was victim of demoniac behavior in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital. For two weeks, she struggled between life and death in hospitals,"" she said in a tweet in Hindi. She said incidents of rape one after another, in Hathras, Shahjahanpur and Gorakhpur have shaken the state. ""Law and order in UP has deteriorated beyond limits. There is no semblance of safety for women. Criminals are committing crimes in the open,"" Priyanka Gandhi said. The killers of this girl should be punished severely, she demanded. ""You are accountable for the safety of women in UP,"" the Congress leader tweeted, tagging Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate alleged that for eight days no gangrape charges were pressed in the matter and only after the media reported it, the police registered a case. She also alleged that the UP chief minister's information advisor and the Agra Police, up until September 24, kept calling this ""fake news"". ""Questions still remain. Why did it take eight days for the UP police to register a gangrape case on her complaint, why was she immediately not transferred to a premier institute like AIIMS, and instead was left to die in UP? Why is it that these men who brutally assaulted, raped and murdered her, do not face NSA (National Security Act) charges and why is it that the UP chief minister is absolutely quiet on this?"" Shrinate asked. Claiming that there is no law and order in UP, she alleged the police are ""hand in glove"" with criminals and the government extends them ""political patronage"". ""I will also raise questions on the absolute conspicuous silence of the prime minister, and women leaders of the BJP who had at one point in time said it is their moral duty to raise their voice on crimes against women and today when they are in charge of those departments, they do not utter a word,"" she said. If one does not condemn this, then one is very much ""hand in glove"" with the criminals, Shrinate said. The Congress demands justice for the rape victim and the culprits should be brought to book, she said. It should be a speedy trial, and the UP government should apologise to her family for calling it ""fake news"" for as long as they did, Shrinate added. Citing that crimes against women had taken place in various cities in the state such as Hathras, Unnao, Shahjahanpur, Gorakhpur, Barabanki and Lakhimpur, Shrinate alleged that women are subjected to brutal rape, assault and murder in the state and the government ""keeps quiet and turns the other way"". ""UP is today the crime capital of the country not just in murder and extortion, but in rapes and molestation. When will this end? The reason that it is not ending is because the UP government has tainted members,"" she said. ""Will the members who face criminal charges of rape and murder"" be responsible for enforcing law and order in the state, she asked. Out of about 312 BJP MLAs, 83 face serious charges such as murder and rape, Shrinate claimed. ""We stand in solidarity with the victim's family. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family,"" she added. The woman was allegedly gang-raped on September 14 following which she was admitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh. She was referred to the Delhi hospital on Monday after her condition showed no signs of improvement. On September 14, the woman had gone to the fields with her mother and had gone missing soon after. She was later found brutally injured, with her tongue having a serious cut as she bit it while the accused attempted to strangulate her, an SP had said, while giving details of the incident.

A 19-year-old Indian girl, reportedly gang-raped by four ""upper-caste"" men, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh this month, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in New Delhi on Tuesday morning. The victim was transferred to Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital from another facility in the regional town of Aligarh. She was taken to the Aligarh hospital on 15 September, a day after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by four men on a farm in the neighbouring town of Hathras. All four people named by the victim have been arrested and charged under relevant sections of the Indian penal code, including murder and carrying out atrocities against Dalit or people in the lowest strata of the caste system. The incident sparked outrage across the Indian political spectrum as well as social media, with many prominent personalities taking potshots at the state government for rising atrocities against members of the socially underprivileged Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh. The northern state, which is India's most populous, is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Lamenting the increasing occurrence of sexual assaults in the state, general secretary of India's main opposition party, Congress, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra remarked that such incidents have sent a shiver down the spines of everyone. ""The culprits should be brought to book"", Vadra wrote in a tweet in Hindi.  Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, who is seen as a leader among the Dalit community, has also been attacking the state authorities over the incident. Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut also expressed dismay over the death of the 19-year-old victim on her Twitter account. Shoot these rapists publicly, what is the solution to these gang rapes that are growing in numbers every year? What a sad and shameful day for this country.

(ANI photo)  BHIM army supporters during a protest over the death of a rape victim in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, at India Gate in New Delhi Sept. 30. (ANI photo) NEW DELHI тАФ The gang rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of IndiaтАЩs caste system sparked outrage across the country Sept. 30, with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying in the streets. The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar PradeshтАЩs Hathras district. The womanтАЩs family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Sept. 29, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar PradeshтАЩs chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, Sept. 30 ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, тАЬStop rape culture.тАЭ Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic WomenтАЩs Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by ModiтАЩs Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the тАЬrape state of India.тАЭ тАЬWe do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,тАЭ Mullah said. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits тАФ formerly known as тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ and at the bottom of IndiaтАЩs unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy тАФ are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence. Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court. In the latest case, questions were raised over a hasty cremation, with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights. The woman was cremated early Sept. 30, with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home. Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as тАЬabusive and unjust.тАЭ In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime. In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged. Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts. According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 тАФ an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma of sexual violence. (Associated Press videojournalist Shonal Ganguly contributed to this report.) Your comment has been submitted.

Four caste men allegedly gangraped a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh on September 14, The Times of India reported on Thursday. The woman had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital after suffering serious injuries. The woman told the police in a statement on September 22 that the four men raped her on September 14 when she had gone to collect firewood. She is still in ICU but out of danger. Last week, based on a complaint by the womanтАЩs brother, the police had booked a man identified as Sandeep for attempted murder, under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The family alleged Sandeep had tried to kill the woman over some old enmity. The police arrested the accused and he was remanded in judicial custody. Hathras Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir said on Thursday that after the womanтАЩs statement, gang rape charges were added to the first information report and three persons were booked. тАЬOne accused has been held and the others, too, will be soon arrested,тАЭ he told The Times of India. Additional Superintendent of Police Prakash Kumar said the police will file the chargesheet soon. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President Deepak Kumar met the woman and alleged that the accused were threatening her and her family. He said he will give a detailed report on the matter to party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi and State President Ajay Kumar Lallu. Congress leader Shyoraj Jivan Valmiki met the complainantтАЩs family members and demanded action against the police officers for the delay in recording her statement. He said that no injustice to members of the Dalit community would be tolerated. Earlier this month, a three-year-old girl was gangraped and killed in a sugarcane field in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Lakhimpur Kheri district. On August 28, a man in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Maharajganj district raped and murdered a 12-year-old girl and left her body in a forest. The accused took the child to eat snacks on his bicycle on Friday evening. After that, he took her to a forest, raped her and strangled her. The accused, then, returned to the village. He has been arrested. On August 24, a 17-year-old girl was found dead near her house in the same district. The police said the minor was raped before being killed with a sharp weapon. On August 14, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered in the district. The body of the girl, who was strangled with her tongue allegedly cut, was found in a sugarcane field owned by one of the accused. The police have arrested four men in connection with the case under charges of gang rape and murder.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

The accused and five other suspects were arrested on Saturday. The victim, Devji Maheshvari, was a senior activist of the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF), and of the Indian Legal Professional. A Crime Branch official in Mumbai told the newspapers that the accused identified as Raval had threatened Maheshwari in the past too. They both belonged to Rapar town in Kutch. тАЬMaheshwari wrote and shared posts critical Brahmanism on his Facebook page. Raval disagreed with those views and warned Maheshwari on several occasions to refrain from writing such posts publicly.тАЭ The official said. According to police, both had clashed repeatedly over the last month. тАЬRaval, who is Brahmin, had asked Maheshwari not to create trouble since both of them are from the same village. He also threatened him at his office once. But Maheshwari told him that he would not back down, and challenged him to do what he liked,тАЭ said the official. Raval, Mumbai Police said, travelled to Rapar from Malad on Wednesday with the intention of murdering Maheshwari. CCTV footage from the area showed Maheshwari entering his office building at 6 pm on Friday and a man wearing a red T-shirt following him inside. Seconds later, the man runs out of the building and flees. Raval was booked under charges of murder and criminal conspiracy and under sections of the SC/ST Act at Rapar police station. A team from the Gujarat Police arrived in Mumbai late Saturday night to take custody of Raval. The Crime Branch official said Raval, who was identified as the man in the CCTV footage, was acting alone. However, the Gujarat Police have registered an FIR against nine accused, including Raval. On Saturday, hours after members of the Dalit community in Rapar took to the streets, demanding the arrest of MaheshwariтАЩs assailants, five of the nine accused, besides Raval, were arrested, while the others are yet absconding. рдпрд╣ рд╣реИ рдЧреБрдЬрд░рд╛рдд рдХреЗ рд░рд╛рдкрд░ рддрд╣рд╕реАрд▓ рдореЗрдВ рд╣рддреНрдпрд╛ рдХрд╛ рд╢рд┐рдХрд╛рд░ рдмрдиреЗ рдмрд╛рдорд╕реЗрдл рдХреЗ рдПрдбрд╡реЛрдХреЗрдЯ рд╕рд╛рдереА рджреЗрд╡рдЬреА рдорд╣реЗрд╢реНрд╡рд░реА рдХреА рдкрддреНрдиреА рдХрд╛ рд╡реАрдбрд┐рдпреЛред рдХрд▓ рд╕реЗ рд╡рд╣ рдЖрдВрджреЛрд▓рди рдкреЗ рдмреИрдареЗ рд╣реИ тАУ рдпрд╣ рдорд╛рдВрдЧ рдХреЗ рд╕рд╛рде рдХрд┐ рдЬрдм рддрдХ рдЙрдирдХреЗ рдкрддрд┐ рдХреЗ рдХрд╛рддрд┐рд▓реЛрдВ рдХрд┐ рдЧрд┐рд░рдлреНрддрд╛рд░реА рдирд╣реАрдВ рд╣реЛрддреА рддрдм рддрдХ рд╡рд╣ рдЕрдиреНрди тАУ рдЬрд▓ рдХреЛ рд╣рд╛рде рдирд╣реАрдВ рд▓рдЧрд╛рдпреЗрдВрдЧреАред @vijayrupanibjp рд╕рдВрд╡реЗрджрдирд╢реАрд▓рддрд╛ рджрд┐рдЦрд╛рдЗрдПред pic.twitter.com/hQgLDZALli тАФ Jignesh Mevani (@jigneshmevani80) September 26, 2020  Apart from Raval, the other accused named in the FIR are Jaysukh Luhar, Khimji Luhar, Dhaval Luhar, Devubha Sodha, Vijaysinh Sodha, Mayursinh Sodha, Pravinsinh Sodha and Arjansinh Sodha.

This bill acts makes the construction of insanitary latrines an offense and calls for the conversion of all insanitary latrines within a stipulated time frame. It bans employment of people as manual scavengers for cleaning of insanitary latrines and cleaning of sewers and septic tanks without protective gear. The statement regrets that while in 1955, the Protection of Civil Rights Act was passed for the abolition of scavenging or sweeping on grounds of untouchability, only in 1989, the Prevention of Atrocities Act became an integrated guard for sanitation workers, recognising that more than 90 percent of people employed as manual scavengers belong to the scheduled castes. It was only in 1993 that the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act was passed seeking stricter stance against the employment of manual scavengers, but as this Act had its limitations. The 2003 CAG report observed, the Act тАЬhas failed to achieve its objectives even after 10 years of implementation.тАЭ A decade later, Parliament passed the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013 with greater emphasis on rehabilitation of manual scavengers, yet the hiring of manual scavengers for the work of cleaning the septic tanks, directly or contractually, continued. Meanwhile, sewer-related deaths over the last one decade тАЬincreased four-foldтАЭ, reaching 1,000, the statement said.

Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma said the incident happened in the Gaisari area of the district, where a 22-year-old Dalit woman, working in a private firm, failed to return home in time on Tuesday evening, prompting her parents to start looking for her. The woman's parents said she did not respond to calls on her mobile phone, triggering panic among family members, the police said. The woman, however, returned home shortly later in an autorickshaw with an intravascular cannula, medically known as Vigo and used for administering injection, glucose or other fluids in the body, inserted in her hand, the police said, quoting her parents. The girl looked dazed and in a serious condition, prompting her parents to rush her to a nearby hospital, but she died on the way, said the SP. When the matter was reported to the police from the hospital, the parents alleged that their daughter was gang-raped, SP Verma said. Acting on the parent's complaint, police identified the accused as Shahid and Sahil and arrested them, the SP said. Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said, ""After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gang-raped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition. Condolences!"" ""The BJP government should commit no laxity in this case as was done in Hathras and arrest the accused immediately,"" he added with a hashtag#Balrampur... #NoMoreBJP"" on his Tweeter handle.

New Delhi | Published: 19:50, Sep 29,2020 A Dalit teenager allegedly raped by four upper-caste men died from injuries on Tuesday, sparking outrage from Indian activists, politicians and Bollywood stars. IndiaтАЩs 200 million low-caste тАШuntouchableтАЩ Dalits have long faced discrimination and abuse and campaigners say attacks have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 19-year-old girl was brutally assaulted in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on September 14, according to a complaint filed by the family with the police. The four accused have been arrested, according to the authorities. Found lying in a pool of blood and paralysed from injuries to her neck and spine, the woman was rushed to a local hospital before being brought to New Delhi on Monday as her condition worsened. тАШShe died during the course of treatment on Tuesday morning. We will ensure swift investigation and trial in the case,тАЩ Hathras district police chief Vikrant Vir told AFP. The news comes months after four men were hanged for the brutal gang rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi in 2012тАФ a case which came to symbolise the nationтАЩs problem with sexual violence, gaining worldwide notoriety and being turned into a Netflix TV show. Bollywood personalities and womenтАЩs rights activists took to social media to condemn this monthтАЩs attack. тАШSad, sad day. How much longer can this be allowed to go on,тАЩ wrote director-producer Farhan Akhtar. Activist Kavita Krishnan said the attack reflected the тАШlarger picture of structural violenceтАЩ against Dalit women. Priyanka Gandhi, a member of the opposition Congress party, blamed the assault on the deteriorating law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra ModiтАЩs Bharatiya Janata Party. Women in India are subjected to alarming levels of sexual assaults, irrespective of their caste or class. Nearly 34,000 rapes were reported in the country in 2018, but the figures are considered the tip of the iceberg, with many victims too scared to come forward.

""Roop Kishore has been booked for murder and under sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act at the Bilsi police station.

The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar PradeshтАЩs Hathras district. The womanтАЩs family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Tuesday, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar PradeshтАЩs chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, тАЬStop rape culture.тАЭ Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic WomenтАЩs Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by ModiтАЩs Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the тАЬrape state of India.тАЭ тАЬWe do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,тАЭ Mullah said. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits тАФ formerly known as тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ and at the bottom of IndiaтАЩs unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy тАФ are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence. Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court. In the latest case, questions were raised over a hasty cremation, with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights. The woman was cremated early Wednesday, with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home. Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as тАЬabusive and unjust.тАЭ In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime. In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged. Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts. According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 тАФ an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma of sexual violence. ___ Associated Press videojournalist Shonal Ganguly contributed to this report.

"681",6223,"https://www.goya.in/blog/blood-fry-other-recipes-from-my-dalit-childhood","Blood Fry & Other Dalit Recipes from My Childhood ├втВмтАЭ GOYA","Vinay Kumar writes about the food of Dalit communities and tries to answer the question: Where does blood fry fit into a mapping of food in India? My mom hasn't cooked blood fry in 27 years. She isn't particularly fond of it. But she remembers cooking it with her grandmother, and has promised to teach me how. It takes over five months to source the blood. To reimagine Dalit food, born out of hunger, poverty and marginalisation, as a coffee table book would be a disservice to our struggles. Ours is a food culture that has survived in the memory of its people. Food from Dalit communities have never been featured in cookbooks; we have never had a cookbook of our own either. You can find ragi mudde in Military Hotel menus, or at Gowdru Manes, drenched in ghee. But when my mother and her siblings packed leftover mudde from breakfast as lunch for school, they would hide, away from their classmates and far from the school grounds, eating quickly before they could be discovered. Our existence and our life experiences, our memoirs and autobiographies, are works of resistance. Our eating practices, too are a protest. Where or how does blood fry fit into a menu, a cuisine, a cookbook, or even an understanding of food in India? The answer to that question can be found where Dalits are found in India: on the margins. Military Hotels, meat stalls around wine shops and bars in Dalit neighbourhoods, often prepare it. But blood fry has slowly faded out of our kitchens, in an attempt to hide our poverty, and for other reasons similar to why people hesitate to cook beef or dry fish. But the community-consciousness has held on to this dish. In small pockets, in the margins of the society, we hold on to our tradition. I grew up spending a lot of time indoors, lurking by the kitchen door. It was here that I built relationships with all the women in my family; while peeling vegetables, doing the dishes or just sitting on the kitchen shelf and making conversation. Kitchens are great for building relationships and telling stories, and boy oh boy, does my family have stories. From scandals to narrow escapes, the kitchen was always bustling with stories, especially when three or more people cooked together. тАЬIt takes a little love and effort to make decent dal, thatтАЩs it,тАЭ my friend Shalini said about the food at the student mess. Shalini is one of my closest friends from the University of Hyderabad. She was right; both of us were Dalit kids who grew up in lower-middle-class homes where money was scarce. I never starved as a child, and even when things were bad, we almost always managed. At home, we ate rice and dal (without tadka, because oil was too expensive). And we had to save the last packet of Gold Winner Sunflower Oil in case of emergency тАФ which was usually a guest showing up unannounced. The only thing worse than actually being poor is someone else finding out you are poor. But weтАЩd made peace with our poverty early on. IтАЩd rummage desperately through the kitchen for things to eat because my appetite was huge. Growing up, IтАЩd eat as much as any adult at home. Often, IтАЩd make do with ready-to-eat breakfast foods, like an old packet of shavge (vermicelli) or an MTR vangibath/bisibelebath masala, or rava idli mix. My memories of food werenтАЩt always happy, or cheerful. In fact my most vivid memory of food was a yearning to eat the food from the SunDrop oil ad, because that was food IтАЩd never seen or tasted. Food doesn't always carry memories of love, care, or warmth. Sometimes they are reminders of harsh realities. Beef brought that into sharp relief for us. Then, there is the shame attached to food тАФ that is a subject that has no place in food writing. Nobody wanted to talk about beef until after it was banned; not the way it is discussed today. Many people hadnтАЩt even tasted beef until then. The ban only served to make beef more expensive for us, given the fear of beef-related violence and lynching. Despite countless reports, op-eds, editorials, anthropological studies and academic discourse, It seems like India still has trouble recognising the origin of beef: Simply put, beef was consumed because it was available to many Dalit communities in the form of carcasses. It was their тАШcaste's jobтАЩ to dispose of the carcass тАФ and to do so without payment. So the carcass became payment. Oppression, geography, local species of flora, fauna and animals, and caste hierarchy have deeply influenced the food culture of Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi communities in ways that social scientists are still trying to map. My mother described blood fry as a dish prepared by poor families when they couldnтАЩt afford meat. Made with coagulated goat blood, it is a local delicacy, and Military Hotels in Karnataka often serve it. Military Hotels deserve their own story, but to briefly explain, they are cheap eateries designed to serve meat to Army personnel who couldn't find meat elsewhere in the Brahminical town of Bangalore. Blood fry is a simple dish, and cooks easily, but is also very easy to mess up. The tricky part is sourcing blood. Butchers donтАЩt keep blood in their shops anymore, so they need a few daysтАЩ notice to get you what you need. The blood will remain red, but youтАЩve still got to wash it three times. My momтАЩs tip for cooking blood is to drop it into boiling water before frying it. Does blood fry have nutritional value? Yes, it does. According to a food label from Iceland, it isnтАЩt just Dalits who cook and eat lamb blood. You may read about other тАШethnicтАЩ cuisines using blood, but never in the same breath will you learn that it was also used as a traditional thickening agent in French cuisine. 100 g of blood contains protein content of 17.4 g, and fat of 0.4 g. Lamb meat has 25g protein and 20 g fat per 100 g, and chicken has 30g protein and 14 g fat. My young cousin, who has never tasted, cooked or even hunted rat meat, announced authoritatively at a family gathering, that you need to blow a conch shell and smoke, to kill a rat. All the adults burst into laughter because, in Kannada, a conch shell and smoke is often a metaphor for death. Rats steal grain from paddy fields, and stash them away in burrows, only to be later discovered when the fields are cleared for the next crop. The rat ends up as dinner that night, or lunch the following day. Rats are cleaned and skinned like chicken, then barbecued on open flame, or cut into smaller pieces for a mixed vegetable and dal sambar. Many of our cultural practices and spiritual beliefs, much of our oral tradition of stories, songs, music and literature, have faded away. But Dalit literature as a genre and literary movement emerged out of strife, resisting the caste system and people who've othered us, and denied our lived experiences; it called them out and recognised our histories. Our food may never be part of IndiaтАЩs тАШmainstreamтАЩ culture, but it is a part of our who we are, and a part of what India is. Blood fry is a side dish, like a thoran, meant to accompany rice and curry, or ragi mudde and curry. It can also be eaten with chapati. It is a dish that Dalit communities prepared to make up for the absence of meat тАФ an unaffordable luxury. Ingredients250 gm goat blood1 large (or 2 medium) onions1/2 bunch coriander leaves1/2 bunch mint leaves5-10 garlic cloves (or more if thatтАЩs how you like it)50 g gingerOil, to saut├й1 medium tomato2-3 green chilliesRed chilli powder, to tasteCoriander powder, to tasteTurmeric, to tasteGaram masala (we love the Shakti Masalas or the chicken masala)Salt, to taste MethodWash the blood, then cook it for a couple of minutes in boiling water. Cooking blood is similar to cooking paneer, tofu or kheema. You could crush it with your hand to give it the kheema/ egg bhurji texture or cut it into cubes as youтАЩd with paneer or tofu after taking it out of the water.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed wok, as you would for cooking any meat.Add in the onion and fry until they begin to brown. Now add chillies, tomatoes. (My great grand aunt used to add dill at this point, you can too.)But you should add mint and coriander leaves now.Now you add salt, turmeric, chilli powder, garam masala. Mix well to combine.Finally, add in the blood.Mix it well, then cover the wok with a lid and allow to cook for 5 minutes.Uncover and remove from heat. Serve hot.

The two recent cases of posting against caste divide, irrespective of the posts being objectionable or not, have had exceptionally adverse repercussions. Where a Dalit Lawyer, Devji Maheshwari had been murdered on Friday, Prashant Kanojia, a freelance journalist is still under arrest on sharing objectionable content which he had immediately deleted when realized of it being morphed. On Friday, Devji Maheshwari, a Dalit lawyer and activist in GujaratтАЩs Kutch district got murdered allegedly by a Brahmin citizen, Bharat Raval from Mumbai over a post criticising Brahminism. Devji was a senior member of All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation and Indian Legal Professionals Association. They accused, Rawal has had clashes with Devji on his views on Brahminism. On a Facebook post by Devji, critical of Brahminism, Raval disagreed and criticized Devji and warned him several times to refrain from writing such posts publically. The killing of the lawyer has led to tensions in the Rapar town of Kutch as the members of the Dalit community are demanding strict actions against the suspects. MaheshwariтАЩs family had named around nine suspects and refused to accept the DevjiтАЩs body until they get arrested. (According to Indian Express) Read more: How Language Matters while addressing the issues of gender-based violence?  Earlier, on 18th August 2020, Bahujan journalist Prashant Kanojia was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police. He is being held in custody over a tweet he had forwarded, with text saying тАУ тАЬIt is Tiwari JiтАЩs direction that entry for SC/ST/OBC be banned in the Ram Mandir and everybody should raise their voice for this.тАЭ This post was coupled with the morphed photograph being circulated by an unknown person changing words along Sushil TiwariтАЩs photo to тАЬтАШRam mandir mein Shudron, OBC, SC, ST ka pravesh nishedh rahega sabhi log ek saath avaaz uthayeinтАЭ. (According to The Wire) Although, it is known that he had immediately deleted upon learning that it contained fake news. Though Kanojia was in custody since then, now, the Allahabad Court has accepted the plea of UP Government demanding 4 weeks time to respond to bail plea meaning Prashant will have to spend one more month in custody. Last year too, Prashant was arrested by UP Police over a tweet and on that, Supreme court ordered his immediate release stating the protocol that is, тАЬfirst, the case is being proved and the accuse is summoned, not arrested until they have been sentenced.тАЭ Now, these are just two cases where writing on social media has to lead to violence and arrests, there are several others too. But what should be observed that anything, slightly against the moral code of the majority leads to intolerance of mass level. As per a report by The Wire, the original post of Tiwari targets Islam, that should also appear in the ambit of objectionable content and Section 505 (2), Section 153 A and 153 B should be imposed on Tiwari too. There are several videos of Tiwari that can contain communal and inflammatory messages against Muslims but no action has been taken over TiwariтАЩs posts till now. All of this only gives a question of to what extent, the objectionable content against the majority is being scrutinised while the content against the minority remains overlooked.

She also initiated distribution of monthly pension and house building grants to about 8,000 Sanatan Brahmin priests in the state. Before addressing the Durga Puja Co-ordination meeting at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Thursday the Chief Minister initiated the distribution by handing over the benefits to some of the Sanatan Brahmin priests. The pension of two months, that is Rs 2,000 for the months of September and October, has been given out together. At the same time they have received Rs 1.20 lakh as a grant to build houses. It was on September 14 when the Chief Minister had announced giving the monthly allowance and free housing and free housing to the Sanatan Brahmin priests. She had then said: ""Many priests from the Sanatan Brahmin sect in Bengal are financially weak. The state has decided to help them by providing a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 and free homes under its housing scheme."" The state government also provided land to the Sanatan Brahmin sect to set up an academy at Kolaghat. The Chief Minister handed over a certificate of recognition to Dalit littereateur Manoranjan Byapari, who has been made the chairman of the Dalit Sahitya Academy, and former MP Vivek Gupta, head of the West Bengal Hindi Academy, following announcement of the Rs 5 crore grant to each of the academies. On September 14, that is on the day of Hindi Diwas, Chief Minister had announced of setting up of the Dalit Sahitya Academy and restructuring of West Bengal Hindi Academy. The step to set up the Dalit Sahitya Academy was taken considering that lakhs of people from the community stay in Bengal and the academy will be representation of people from communities including Namasudra, Matua, Baghdi, Bauri, Dom and Majhi with principal objective of making people aware of the challenges faced by the Dalit and refugees for centuries and also to act as a centre to study the same besides publishing the complete works of Dalit scholars. Similarly, the West Bengal Hindi Academy has been restructured with 25 members with an aim to increase its scope of work. The step has been taken as Bengal loves and respects all languages and the Mamata Banerjee government has given recognition to languages including Hindi, Urdu, Ol Chiki, Gurmukhi, Kuruk, Rajbanshi and Gurmukhi. ┬й Copyrights 2020.

The dead body of 35-year-old Mintradevi Baitha was found in a field some 400 meters away from her house on Sunday evening. According to the police, she was killed on Sunday evening just a few minutes before they received the information of the murder at around 6:15 p.m. ""The woman was found strangled with a sari when we first saw her dead body in the sight,"" said SP Raviraj Khadka of District Police Office, Rautahat. Baitha belonged to a simple family. Her husband works in a landfill area in Kathmandu. She had left her house in the evening in order to collect grass from the field to feed her livestock. Villagers, who saw her body, had quickly informed the police. ""There are bruises all over her body,"" said SP Khadka, who is also the chief at the office. Police also spotted littered leaves and demolished sugarcane plants at the site. This has led to a suspicion that Baitha might have been killed after being raped, ""But there is no evidence yet to prove that. We have to go through her autopsy report before making any such conclusion,"" said Khadka. According to Khadka, Baitha's body has been brought to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for postmortem.

Fifteen activists and scholars have already been arrested in the case and nine out of these have been in jail for nearly two years, as undertrials. Professor Babu has been a strong advocate for social justice and has worked strenuously in the anti-caste movement, speakers said in the webinar. Dr. Udit Raj, former MP and national spokesperson of Congress pointed out that тАЬthe fascist government used Bhima Koregaon case as an excuse for targetingтАЭ Hany Babu and other academicians as part of silencing the intellectuals in India. Raj who is also the founder and national chairman of the All India Confederation of SC/ST Organizations said that Babu has worked extensively against the Four-year Undergraduate Program (FYUP) in the University of Delhi which was discriminatory to the students belonging to the marginalized communities and the program was dropped in 2014. Udit Raj and Hany Babu jointly wrote an article in The Hindu on FYUP in 2013. тАЬI know him very well. I worked with him closely,тАЭ Raj said. T. K. S. Elangovan, Rajya Sabha member, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader called Hany Babu as a champion of social justice. тАЬHis arrest shows how the government wants to make sure that no intellectual remains free to speak out against the regime. Initially, they killed intellectuals, now they are arresting them,тАЭ Elangovan noted. DMK leader said that four professors including Babu who worked for the welfare of Dalits and marginalized groups in the country were arrested over flimsy and fabricated charges. Elangovan also urged political parties to unite and raise their voice against the recent arrests of academicians. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and MP Manoj Jha condemned BabuтАЩs arrest and expressed his and his party RJDтАЩs full solidarity with the jailed professor. тАЬThe government is trying to strip off professor Hany BabuтАЩs dignity, forcing him to give false testimony in the case and framing him as a person who has close Maoist ties. Hany has always raised his voice for the need for inclusive institutional policies. He fought the system that discriminates against students based on their caste, hence why heтАЩs arrested and held in prison,тАЭ said E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP and the leader of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). тАЬThere should be space to question the power and hierarchy,тАЭ Basheer added. He also ensured that Muslim LeagueтАЩs four MPs will stand for justice for Hany Babu in the Parliament. According to Raj Kumar Saini, former MP and Loktantra Suraksha Party leader, Babu was a strong voice of Bahujans in India. Saini who condemned the NIA arrest criticised BJPтАЩs efforts to suppress Bahujan intellectuals and leaders in the country. тАЬHany babu has done a great job in the matter of reservations including legal interventions,тАЭ K. Ambujakshan, general secretary of Welfare Party of India expressed his solidarity and support to professor Babu. тАЬWhen criminals are in power, Intellectuals are in jail,тАЭ said Dalit leader Ambujakshan. Annie Raja, CPI leader and General Secretary of National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) said that Hany Babu strongly believed in the Constitution and wanted to translate the constitutional rights in the lives of Dalits, tribals, and Bahujans in the country. The webinar also had Dr.Harish MT, brother of Hany Babu who said that the government thinks they can use this case to silence the academicians. тАЬThey are not even filing the charge sheet properly,тАЭ Harish also demanded the immediate release of his brother and all political prisoners who were arbitrarily arrested and falsely framed by NIA and police. Sachin Narayanan, an assistant professor of English in Delhi University and representative of the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) expressed his thanks for all lawmakers and politicians who joined the campaign for Hany Babu.

Barber 'for all' ends discrimination against Dalits of India","Discover Thomson Reuters By Anuradha Nagaraj 3 Min Read CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The struggle to get a haircut during the coronavirus lockdown has led to a rare victory for IndiaтАЩs marginalised Dalit community - a barbershop. Scheduled to open for business next week, the тАЬsalon for allтАЭ in Idukki district of Kerala state in southern India has brought cheer to more than 200 Dalit families refused haircuts by their neighbourhood barbers in keeping with ancient caste bias. тАЬI am against discrimination and wanted this practice to end,тАЭ said P. Ramaraj, president of Vattavada village council, which is funding the new shop. тАЬWe tried to negotiate with the two barbershops in the village and eventually had to seal them (shut) because they refused to cooperate. But people need to get a haircut and shave so we decided to open a new salon, where everyone will be welcome.тАЭ Welcoming the move, daily wage earner Selvam Durairaj said that he had been forced to travel 45 km (28 miles) for a haircut since childhood. тАЬEach haircut trip costs us at least 200 Indian rupees ($2.73), an expense we canтАЩt afford. Sometimes we cut each otherтАЩs hair and young boys often wear a cap to hide it,тАЭ Durairaj, 35, said in a phone interview. тАЬOur grandfathers and fathers have protested in the past but nothing changed.тАЭ Dalits, formerly known as untouchables - are at the bottom of the ancient caste hierarchy linked to the Hindu faith and face routine segregation and abuse. India banned caste-based discrimination in 1955, but biases persist - be it a ban on Dalits sharing wells, visiting the same temples, or drinking from common cups at tea stalls. Dalit children are even made to sit at the back of class in some schools. тАЬTraditionally, across India, barbers and washermen have rendered services only to upper-caste families in exchange of foodgrains,тАЭ said Baghambar Pattanaik, president of charity Anti-Slavery India. тАЬBarbers fear social and economic boycott from their upper caste clients if they cut a DalitтАЩs hair. In fact, barbers themselves are victims and are forced by circumstances to continue these biases.тАЭ Mayil Palaniswamy, who sent a written complaint to the Vattavada village administration demanding the change, said his campaign was about far more than a haircut. тАЬIt is a fight for our rights,тАЭ he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation over the phone. A graduate working in a government e-service centre, Palaniswamy and his friends garnered support for their cause through social media, spotlighting the discrimination that тАЬmany were not aware existedтАЭ. тАЬWe deserve equal access and this is a chance to correct a historic wrong.тАЭ Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj @AnuraNagaraj; Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

Retired politicians and many other eminent personalities visited the Valmiki colony and shared experiences of discrimination as a Dalit in India (MIG Photos/Aman Kanojiya) Even as the government and administration were busy disbursing facilities to the residents of Karhera, police also registered a first information report (FIR) at Sahibabad police station on Thursday against unidentified people for тАШspreading false rumours about religious conversionsтАЩ. The case was filed on a complaint lodged by Montu Chandel, a self-proclaimed social worker. тАЬPeople were given money and were promised houses and other amenities in exchange for conversion. It was forced upon them The villagers have converted only because they were inveigled to do so in a ploy to tarnish the governmentтАЩs reputation,тАЭ Chandel told Media India Group. However, the members of the community deny the allegations and say they converted in presence of members of the Buddhist Society of India and have also been given a certificate. тАЬI was there when the conversion took place. More than 200 people of our community have willingly converted to Buddhism. We have evidence in photographs, videos and eyewitnesses. How can anyone claim that the conversion is a false rumour,тАЭ Pawan, another recent convert and resident of Karhera village told Media India Group. Pawan says that the Valmikis will continue their fight till justice is served to the Hathras victim (MIG Photos/Aman Kanojiya) тАЬOn the one hand, the local politicians and authorities have asked us why we converted and noted our problems; on the other hand, state government calls it a plot to vitiate the atmosphere and even Ghaziabad district administration denies that any such incident took place at all. These two totally contradict each other,тАЭ says 65-year-old Inder Ram Maharaj, another convert. The residents also say that a number of policemen have been deployed in their area who keep a strict watch on every passer-by. Some allege that they have been threatened by the police and are being forced to deny that the conversions even took place. тАЬI was taken to a police post the night after the authorities got to know about our conversion. They made me sit there and asked me to confess on video that no conversions took place at all and it was only a gathering to greet Rajratna Ambedkar. They assured me of no further interrogation if I agreed to do as they said but I refused as I was an eye witness and one of the organisers of the ceremony,тАЭ Pawan adds. While the women were busy doing their household chores at doorsteps and children played and ran in the open courtyard, the village elders discussed their problems, current status of affairs and the media reports of alleged false rumours. Retired politicians and many other eminent personalities sat with the members of the community and shared experiences of discrimination as a Dalit in India. тАЬI am proud of the youngsters of this community who led people to a better way of life, the one which is free of any caste discrimination. Though a few media reports may show us as corrupt and the government may dismiss our issues, we will stand together till justice is served to the Hathras victim and many others who have faced similar atrocities,тАЭ says Pawan. Great and endorsing way that people of ghajiabad have opted .no more atrocities will be endured which r caste based as well as. рд╡рд╛рд▓реНрдореАрдХрд┐ рд╕рдореБрджрд╛рдп рдХреЛ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рдХреЛ рдЕрдкрдирд╛рдиреЗ рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдпреЗ рдПрдХ рдЧрд╛рдБрд╡ рд╣реА рдХреНрдпреЛрдВ рдЪреБрдирд╛ рдЧрдпрд╛? рдХреНрдпреЛрдВрдХрд┐ рд╡рд╣реЙ рдХреЗ рд▓реЛрдЧ рдЕрдЧрд░-рдордЧрд░ рдХрд░рдиреЗ рдореЗрдВ рд╕рдХреНрд╖рдо рдирд╣реАрдВ редрдХреНрдпрд╛ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рдЕрдкрдирд╛рдиреЗ рдХреЗ рдмрд╛рдж рдЫреБрдЖ-рдЫреВрдд рдЦрд╝рддреНрдо рд╣реЛ рдЬрд╛рдпреЗрдЧреА? рд╕рд╡рд░реНрдг рд▓реЛрдЧ рдХрд╣рдиреЗ рд▓рдЧреЗрдВрдЧреЗ рдХрд┐ рдЕрдм рддреБрдо рдХреБрдПрдБ рд╕реЗ рдкрд╛рдиреА рднрд░ рд╕рдХрддреЗ рд╣реЛ, рджреВрд▓реНрд╣рд╛ рдмрдирдХрд░ рдШреЛрдбрд╝реА рдкрд░ рдЪрдврд╝ рд╕рдХрддреЗ рд╣реЛред рдХреНрдпреЛрдВрдХрд┐ рдЕрдм рддреБрдо рдмреМрджреНрдз рд╣реЛ рдЧрдП рд╣реЛ, рднрд▓реЗ рд╣реА рдЕрднреА рднреА рддреБрдо uncleaned profession рдореЗрдВ рдкрд╣рд▓реА рдХреА рддрд░рд╣ рд▓рдЧреЗ рд╣реЛредрдЬреЛ рдХреБрдЫ рдЗрди рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рдиреЗ рдЕрдкрдирд╛рдпрд╛ рдореЗрд░реА рд░рд╛рдп рдореЗрдВ рд╡рд╣ рдореВрд▓ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рдирд╣реАрдВ рдмрд▓реНрдХрд┐ рдЙрд╕рдореЗрдВ рд╕реЗ рдирд┐рдХрд▓рд╛ рдПрдХ рдЕрд▓рдЧ рд╕рдореНрдкреНрд░рджрд╛рдп рд╣реИ, рдЬрд┐рд╕реЗ рдирд╡рдпрд╛рдирд╛ рдпрд╛ Neo-Buddhism рдХрд╣рддреЗ рд╣реИрдВ, рдЬрд┐рд╕реЗ рдмрд╛рдмрд╛ рд╕рд╛рд╣рдм рдиреЗрдВ резрепрелрел рдореЗрдВ рдЕрдкрдиреЗ рдЕрдиреБрдпрд╛рдпрд┐рдпреЛрдВ рдХреЗ рд╕рд╛рде рдЕрдкрдирд╛рдпрд╛ рдерд╛, рдЬрд┐рд╕рдореЗрдВ рдЕрдзрд┐рдХрд╛рдВрд╢ рдорд╣рд╛рд░рд╛рд╖реНрдЯреНрд░ рдХреА рджрд▓рд┐рдд рдХрд╝реМрдо рдорд╣рд╛рд░ рдЬрд╛рддрд┐ рдХреЗ рд▓реЛрдЧ рдереЗред рдЖрдЬ рднреА рдЗрд╕ рдирдпреЗ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рдХреЗ рд▓реЛрдЧ репреж% рд╕реЗ рдЕрдзрд┐рдХ рдорд╣рд╛рд░рд╛рд╖реНрдЯреНрд░ рдореЗрдВ рд╣реА рд╣реИрдВредрдореВрд▓ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рд╕реЗ рдЕрд▓рдЧ рдирдпреЗ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рдЕрдкрдирд╛рдиреЗ рдХрд╛ рдХрд╛рд░рдг рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рдХреЛ рд╣рд┐рдВрджреВ рдзрд░реНрдо рдХреА рдЖрд╕реНрдерд╛ рд╡ рдирдорди рд╕реЗ рдЕрд▓рдЧ рдХрд░рдирд╛, рдЬрдмрдХрд┐ рдореВрд▓ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рдореЗрдВ рдЗрд╕рдХрд╛ рд╕рдорд╛рд╡реЗрд╢ рд╣реИ, рдХреНрдпреЛрдВрдХрд┐ рдмреБрджреНрдз рдзрд░реНрдо рд╣рд┐рдВрджреВ рдзрд░реНрдо рд╕реЗ рд╣реА рдирд┐рдХрд▓рд╛ рд╣реИредрд╣рд┐рдВрджреВ рдзрд░реНрдо рдЗрдВрд╕рд╛рди рдХреЛ рд╕реНрд╡рдд: рдкреНрд░рд╛рдХреГрддрд┐рдХ рддреМрд░ рдкрд░ рдорд┐рд▓рддрд╛ рд╣реИ, рдЗрд╕рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рдФрд░ рдзрд░реНрдореЛрдВ рдХреА рддрд░рд╣ рджреАрдХреНрд╖рд╛, рдкреИрдЧрдореНрдмрд░, рдпрд╛ рдкреНрд░рдорд╛рдг рдкрддреНрд░ рдХреА рдЬрд╝рд░реВрд░рдд рдирд╣реАрдВ, рдЗрд╕рд▓рд┐рдП рд╕рдм рдзрд░реНрдореЛрдВ рдореЗрдВ рд╢реНрд░реЗрд╖реНрда рд╣реИредрджрд▓рд┐рддреЛрдВ рдХреА рдкреНрд░рдЧрддрд┐ рдХрд╛ рдзрд░реНрдо рдкрд░рд┐рд╡рд░реНрддрди рд░рд╛рд╕реНрддрд╛ рдирд╣реАрдВредрдмрд╛рдмрд╛ рд╕рд╛рд╣рдм рдХреЗ рдмрддрд╛рдпреЗ тАЬ рд╢рд┐рдХреНрд╖рд┐рдд рдмрдиреЛтАЭ рд░рд╛рд╕реНрддреЗ рдкрд░ рдЪрд▓ рдХрд░ рд╣реА рдкреНрд░рдЧрддрд┐ рдХреА рдЬрд╛ рд╕рдХрддреА рд╣реИред рдЫреБрдЖ-рдЫреВрдд рд╡ рднреЗрджрднрд╛рд╡ рдирд┐рд╡рд╛рд░рдг рдХрд╛ рдпрд╣реА рдПрдХ рдорд╛рддреНрд░ рд╡рд┐рдХрд▓реНрдк рд╣реИред Bodhi dharm ko apnanay say faltu Kay Hindu karma kand say chutkara mil Jayta h.

A Dalit woman was allegedly raped at gunpoint by two men, including a former village head, in Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh, police said on Sunday. ""The incident took place a week back, but the police were informed about the alleged gang rape on Sunday,"" Superintendent of Police (Kanpur Dehat) Keshav Kumar Choudhary said. According to a complaint filed by the victim's parents, the accused duo barged into their house when the 22-year-old woman was alone and raped her one by one at gunpoint. They then left after threatening her of dire consequences if she dared to speak about the incident to anyone. A case has been registered under relevant sections of IPC and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 in the matter, SP Choudhary said.  Three police teams headed by SHO Derapur, circle officer and additional SP apart from SWAT team have been formed to arrest the absconding accused, he added. The incident comes close on the heels of the gang rape-murder of another Dalit woman in Hathras that had drawn intense outrage after alleged apathy of the administration.

Rajeshwari Saravana Kumar, president of TherkuThittai Panchayat, a village near Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu, belonging to the Scheduled Caste (Dalit), was forced to sit on the floor during panchayat meetings. S Rajeswari has alleged that she was made to sit on the floor during meetings of the panchayat board by the vice-president ever since she was elected to the post in January this year. Twitter As photos of Rajeshwari sitting on the floor while members of village panchayat sitting on chairs went viral on social media, the district police swung into action on Saturday. The panchayat secretary has now been suspended after the president of the panchayat filed a complaint on Saturday morning. A case under various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act has been filed against vice-president Mohanrajan and the panchayat secretary Sindhuja, who has been placed under suspension. Twitter Rajeswari said the vice-president never allowed her to discharge her duties as the president and even prevented her from hoisting the national flag on the Independence Day. Only 250 kms from capital city Chennai and 40 kms from the town of Cuddalore, the village of Therkuthittai is dominated by the Vanniyars. The Vanniyar, typically not a marginalised community, and vastly comprising of traditional agricultural laborers formerly known as the Palli, are a community found in northern Tamil Nadu, southern Andhra Pradesh and in southern Karnataka. The village consists of around 500 families who are mostly Vanniyars and 100 households from the SC community. The panchayat is reserved for SC community. RajeswariтАЩs husband Saravanakumar said the family did not muster the courage to speak out again... This comes two months after a panchayat president in Tiruvallur district near Chennai was not allowed to unfurl the national flag on the occasion of Independence Day. However, V Amurtham, president of Aathupaakam village, hoisted the tricolour five days later upon the intervention of the district administration. Start a conversation, not a fire.

Relatives and journalists walk down the narrow lane to her house while police vehicles rumble past. A crowd of Congress and Samajwadi Party workers sit in protest near the barricades. At around noon on September 30, when the house was crowded with media personnel, the police came and picked up AshaтАЩs father, claiming there would be тАЬsome interaction with Yogi AdityanathтАЭ, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. At the time, AshaтАЩs brother said, тАЬI am not sure in what way he will be pressured but we are very scared right now.тАЭ This morning, her brother sent Newslaundry a video of the father, who had returned from the police station. In the video, AshaтАЩs father alleged that he was made to тАЬsign some paperтАЭ at the police station, тАЬafter being pressured by police and DM saabтАЭ, referring to the district magistrate.

At around 2 am on September 30, AshaтАЩs body was cremated by the Uttar Pradesh police without a single family member being present. The family says they did not consent to the cremation. In a video that circulated on social media, the police was seen talking to the family on the night of the cremation. An officer said: тАЬIn this extraordinary situation, you have to accept that you have made some mistakes.тАЭ Does the family agree? AshaтАЩs sister-in-law told us, тАЬYes, our fault is that we trusted the police. Yes, our fault is that she was a Dalit girl. Yes, our fault is that we didnтАЩt agree for her to be cremated at night. If she was from a Thakur family, none of our mistakes would have been pointed out.тАЭ Today, the Valmiki women no longer feel safe in the Thakur-dominated village. No dignity even in death Compounding AshaтАЩs assault and death, her family is inconsolable about not being able to conduct her last rites with dignity. The family learned of her death a little after 6 am on September 29, when a doctor at DelhiтАЩs Safdarjung Hospital told AshaтАЩs brother, who was waiting outside, that she had died. At 7.15 am, the brother texted Newslaundry: тАЬMaтАЩam, didi ab nahi rahin.тАЭ MaтАЩam, my sister is no more. The body was taken for postmortem and was returned to the hospital by noon.

After the postmortem, AshaтАЩs sister-in-law said, itтАЩs unclear what exactly happened to the body, as AshaтАЩs brother and father, who were at the hospital, were surrounded by the media. тАЬWhen the officials left the hospital in an ambulance with the body, there was no family member in the ambulance,тАЭ she said. Instead, AshaтАЩs brother and father were in a car that the ambulance was following from Delhi to Hathras. тАЬAt some point, the ambulance and the car split ways,тАЭ AshaтАЩs cousin said. тАЬThe ambulance took a different route while her brother and father reached home.тАЭ The cousin said the police and the ambulance reached AshaтАЩs house a little after midnight, and told the family to cremate the body quickly. The family told the police that according to Hindu traditions, a body cannot be cremated at night, and that they would do so in the morning. Relatives were still on the way and would reach only by daybreak. тАЬThe police continued to build pressure,тАЭ the cousin said. тАЬThey took away one of our relatives from Agra and we still donтАЩt know where he is. We kept trying to request that itтАЩs important for us to be part of this last journey with Asha.тАЭ Newslaundry could not identify who this relative was, and where he was тАЬtakenтАЭ. The cousin added that the police then тАЬcaught holdтАЭ of another relative and asked to speak with him тАЬin privateтАЭ. The family refused to allow the relative to go with the police, the cousin explained, fearing for his safety, given the policeтАЩs harsh attitude. Anticipating that the body might not be handed over, women in the house began surrounding the ambulance. тАЬThe police got so upset that they started pushing our women around,тАЭ said AshaтАЩs sister. тАЬSome of them fell into the field on the side of the road, some fell into the thorny bushes on the side. This was done by both male and female police officers.тАЭ The women began prostrating before the police, AshaтАЩs sister-in-law said, begging for the body and asking for permission to cremate her in the presence of family. тАЬWe fell on the ground. We stretched out our pallus and finally we begged them to at least show us her face once,тАЭ she said. But the police only got more aggressive, and family members locked the gate of their house and did not allow any police officers to enter. AshaтАЩs brother cut in: тАЬForget seeing her face, we havenтАЩt even seen her body bag.тАЭ Finally, the police gave up, family members said, and drove the ambulance to the cremation ground. тАЬThey burnt her away with petrol and diesel and we still donтАЩt even know if that was AshaтАЩs body or not,тАЭ said the sister-in-law, her voice cracking. During the cremation, the police shot a video and later posted it on social media, claiming that AshaтАЩs father had been present at the cremation site. This is vehemently denied by family members, who claim the father had been at home with them. тАЬMy father had almost fainted and was lying on a charpoy here when the cremation took place,тАЭ AshaтАЩs brother said. тАЬThat video is entirely false. The man in that video is someone from our neighbourhood whom they took with them. They made him throw two cow dung cakes into the pyre and made a video saying this is our father.тАЭ The family believes the rushed cremation was because they wanted to ask for a second postmortem. Media cacophony When AshaтАЩs father was taken away by the police in the afternoon yesterday, her mother sat in a corner of the courtyard outside the house, her back against a stone pillar. She wore the same blue sari that she had been wearing on Sunday when these correspondents had visited her. Her voice was hoarse from repeated interactions with the media, and she struggled to complete her sentences. AshaтАЩs brother squatted on the floor opposite her, looking dazed and exhausted. Every inch of the house was occupied by journalists and relatives. A few journalists had climbed to the roof with their cameras; others loudly addressed their cameras in different corners of the house. The family had distributed water in plastic cups to the journalists; these cups now littered the floor. A woman from the house intermittently got up to sweep them away as an ABP News reporter thrust her microphone into the motherтАЩs face, saying: тАЬOkay, but wasnтАЩt there a delay from your end also in reporting the rape?тАЭ AshaтАЩs mother looked back at her, aghast. After a few more sessions on live television, AshaтАЩs mother got up and went indoors. We sat with her here in silence as she cried and called for her daughter. тАЬHow many times am I supposed to keep repeating what happened to my daughter?тАЭ she said. тАЬIтАЩm losing my mind. Where were all these media people when my daughter really needed them?тАЭ We decided not to interview her. Palpable caste divide In stark contrast, the house opposite AshaтАЩs house was quiet and deserted. Three of the four accused тАФ Ramu, Ravi and Luvkush тАФ live here. Ravi and Luvkush were arrested on September 21 and 25, respectively, and Ramu on September 26. Sandeep, the fourth accused, was arrested on the evening of September 19. The village is dominated by Thakur households, with only four Valmiki (Dalit) houses. Two of these are AshaтАЩs and her relatives. The third Valmiki family lives in a house a few metres away from AshaтАЩs; one of the residents here told Newslaundry: тАЬYes, we still practise untouchability in this village.тАЭ Dalits are treated differently in the shops, the neighbour explained. Water is sprinkled on money they hand over to shopkeepers, and nobody wants to touch anything that they have touched. She said that no Thakur will ever enter a Valmiki house but this, in her opinion, is not unusual, not a part of тАЬcaste tensionтАЭ. Valmiki children in the village. тАЬYes, a Valmiki will always sit on the floor and the Thakur on a chair or charpoy but thatтАЩs just how it is, isnтАЩt it? ThatтАЩs our tradition,тАЭ she said. Her two children, studying Classes 6 and 7, also spoke of how in primary school, the Thakur and Dalit students are made to sit separately after protestations from upper caste children, who did not want to sit with the Dalit children. The fourth Valmiki household in the village refused to speak to us. тАЬI donтАЩt know anything,тАЭ a family member said as police personnel walked past. A 75-year-old Thakur resident of the village told Newslaundry he holds no sympathy for the four Thakur accused. тАЬTheyтАЩve caused so much nuisance to this village. This Ravi has misbehaved with women even before,тАЭ he said. Other villagers said that the four accused had тАЬeve-teasedтАЭ and harassed Asha a few months ago as well. Even though the Thakur resident did not explicitly admit that the village had a caste divide, when asked if the Thakurs ever attended Valmiki wedding ceremonies he said, тАЬNo, we donтАЩt. But they come to our weddings and do the cleaning.тАЭ Asha is a pseudonym to protect identity. *** The media must be free and fair, uninfluenced by corporate or state interests.

Raiya village in Gujarat's Banaskantha. Photo: Google Maps New Delhi: After a young Dalit woman from Raiya village in GujaratтАЩs Banaskantha district was allegedly molested by six people from the Patel community, her family members were assaulted by a group of around 25 people when tried to resist the attack. According to independent MLA from Vadgam Jignesh Mevani, the victim and her family members were later booked for assault by the police on a complaint by the accused. According to local media, Mevani said that the incident took place on September 28. Sharing a video of the incident, he tweeted that тАЬa victim was beaten in Gujarat. Like the cops have been trying to defame the victim in Hathras, a girl was molested in Rajya village of Deodar taluka of Banaskantha, her hands and legs were fractured and now the cops charged the victims based on a complaint by the accused persons.тАЭ The report said when a newspaper contacted the victimтАЩs 21-year-old brother, he confirmed the incident.

Six men of the Patel community began teasing her and making fun of her. When she warned them not to tease her, they tore her T-shirt and molested her,тАЭ he said. Other media reports said following the assault, the 23-year-old woman returned to her home and informed her parents about the incident. They, along with her brother and others, then confronted the accused youth and this led to violence between the two sides. Both the woman and her brother were injured. This apart, three people from the side of the accused also sustained injuries and were hospitalised.

Several smaller protests had taken place in the capital since a 19-year-old Dalit girl died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, 15 days after being allegedly gang-raped and brutalised in a village in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Over the past two days, the police had broken up these demonstrations and booked scores of participants for violating the lockdown. A planned candlelight vigil at India Gate on Friday evening was shifted to the protest plaza of Jantar Mantar after the police tweeted on Thursday night that demonstrations would not be allowed at the original venue. The New Delhi deputy commissioner of policeтАЩs office also tweeted that only 100 protesters would be allowed at Jantar Mantar with prior permission. The three Metro stations around the area were shut on Friday evening. But a sea of protesters turned up after DelhiтАЩs ruling Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress publicly supported the programme, promoted on Twitter by student groups, actor Swara Bhasker and the Independent MLA from Gujarat, Jignesh Mevani. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, flanked by his ministers and MLAs, spoke at the protest. тАЬSeveral actions have led people to believe that the culprits are being shielded.... At this point, all that the family need is peace and they should be free to meet whoever they want to. There should be no politics on the matter,тАЭ he said. According to the victimтАЩs family, the police took eight days to invoke the charge of gang rape and five days to arrest the suspects. The force is also accused of denying the girl the best possible treatment and then hijacking her body from the hospital and burning it after locking her family at their home. On Friday, her father said the police had confined the family at their home, taken away their phones and thrashed him when he sought to step out. Bhasker, who led the crowd in sloganeering, said: тАЬThe cases of rape in Hathras and Balrampur (in Uttar Pradesh, where another woman was gang-raped and murdered this week) have raised questions over the conduct of the authorities. Families have said the first information reports were not registered correctly. The CM must step down.тАЭ Among those at the protest site were Mevani, Bhasker, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav. тАЬEvery day in India, four women are raped but who cares? And this includes the male-dominated Dalit movement too,тАЭ Mevani, a Dalit activist, told The Telegraph. So, he said, itтАЩs тАЬgood and requiredтАЭ that people voice their protest against the Hathras atrocity. тАЬI hope Mr (Narendra) Modi also opens his mouthтАж. The Hathras incident is so terrible that there is no option but to fight it out,тАЭ he said. Most television news channels, however, had minimal coverage of the protest. Pro-government Twitter handles busied themselves tweeting about a much smaller hunger strike at the same venue by people who allege that actor Sushant Singh RajputтАЩs death in June was murder, not suicide. BJP politician Kapil Mishra, accused of instigating the February riots that killed 53 people, condemned the protest against the Hathras incident saying the spearheads were тАЬthe same people who spread lies about the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)тАЭ. тАЬHonestly, the protesters are more afraid of the virus than of the police,тАЭ said Prasenjeet Kumar, secretary of the Delhi unit of CPIML LiberationтАЩs All India StudentsтАЩ Association, who has been protesting since Wednesday and has been detained once by the police. тАЬIn all these months, we complied with the governmentтАЩs directives, but the ban on protests is being used to silence dissent itself,тАЭ he told this newspaper. тАЬWe are protesting, even at the risk of facing police cases, in the hope that this struggle will bring together the movements for both social justice and gender justice. We have several women members out protesting today, including some who are facing police cases for the anti-CAA protests. They may criminalise our protests, but silence on heinous and feudal crimes like what happened in Hathras is criminal.тАЭ Youth Congress members dressed as Mahatma Gandhi marched on the road carrying lighted candles. тАЬThey (authorities) should understand that Dalit lives matter,тАЭ CPI general secretary D. Raja said. тАЬIndia cannot continue like this. The whole country is agitating for human rights and dignity. Adityanath cannot continue as CM.тАЭ Raja added: тАЬI appeal to the President (Ram Nath Kovind), who is from UP. He must intervene. He knows whatтАЩs happening. I canтАЩt expect (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi to intervene and set things right.тАЭ Yechury, Azad and Yadav too demanded AdityanathтАЩs resignation over the crime, alleged cover-up attempt, forcible burning of the body and police crackdown on the victimтАЩs family and the village that has seen journalists being roughed up. Police later filed an FIR against the protesters under sections of the penal code, Epidemic Act, and Disaster Management Act, cumulatively punishable with up to 18 months in jail. Elsewhere in Delhi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended a prayer meeting for the victim at the Maharishi Valmiki temple. The victimтАЩs community of Valmiki Dalits worship the Maharishi, considered the author of the original Sanskrit Ramayan. Mahatma Gandhi lived in a room at the temple from 1946 to 1947. тАЬWe will ensure justice for our sister. We wonтАЩt sit quietly till she gets justice,тАЭ Priyanka said. тАЬThe government did not help at all. Her family is feeling helpless. We will put political pressure on the government. She wasnтАЩt even given a cremation following Hindu customs.тАЭ","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

The investigation into the killing of Dalit lawyer Devji Maheshwari in Gujarat has revealed that he was murdered over his social media posts, The Indian Express reported on Sunday. Mumbai Police had arrested prime accused Bharat Raval a day after the murder, and had said that he found MaheshwariтАЩs post тАЬprejudicial to BrahminsтАЭ, the community Raval is from. Maheshwari was stabbed to death on September 25 after he had an argument with Raval about his social media posts. A Special Investigating Team looking into the matter corroborated the Mumbai PoliceтАЩs information in a press release on Sunday. тАЬThe evidence gathered in course of investigation suggests that Maheshwari used to upload objectionable posts about Brahmin community on his Facebook account. Raval had dialled him (Maheshwari) over this and the duo had a heated argument over phone. Investigation establishes that Raval had murdered Maheshwari over disputes that arose out of the social media posts against Brahmin community.тАЭ The SIT also retrieved an audio recording from RavalтАЩs phone that confirms the verbal argument between the two. Maheshwari was a senior member of the Indian Legal Professionals Association and the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation. His last post on Facebook post was a video of Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation National President Waman Meshram saying that members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes were not Hindus. Raval, who is a native of Rapar town in Gujarat, worked at a printer repairing shop run by Mahesh Hanat alias Mahesh Bhoja Patel in MumbaiтАЩs Malad area. After stabbing Maheshwari, Raval escaped to Mumbai with the help of his friends Prakash Bera and Rajesh alias Viram Devda. But when he reached the Malad shop the next day, the Mumbai crime branch had caught him. In her complaint, Devji MaheshwariтАЩs wife had named nine persons, including Raval, as accused. She said the accused had been issuing Maheshwari threats after the 50-year old advocate took up a civil matter relating to a dispute over title of Luhar-Suthar Samaj Vadi, a community hall in the town. Unidentified officials in the investigating team however told The Indian Express that no evidence has so far been found against the other eight persons.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

The shopkeeper suddenly refused to give us groceries. The milk man who used to visit our houses has not come to our Dalit colony since October 2. We did not even get water from the common taps in the village,тАЭ said a woman from a Dalit colony in Ulagam village in Hosur. Related News: Amid UP Dalit rape shock, TN shows why the community gets a raw deal It all started two years ago, after a 22-year-old Dalit youth Suriyakumar, belonging to the Adi Dravidar caste from the village, eloped with a 17-year-old minor girl belonging to the Kurumbar community (categorised as most backward) of Maniyangal village in Hosur. Soon after the incident, while the parents of the girl filed a police complaint against Suriyakumar on the charges of kidnapping and under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the caste-hindus in Ulagam village where SuriyakumarтАЩs family reside, barged into the Dalit colony and assaulted the people there тАЬWe were unaware that Suriyakumar had eloped with a caste-Hindu girl. They barged into our houses and threw everything that was inside and assaulted us,тАЭ says another woman. Based on a complaint from the Dalit people in the village, the police filed a case against as many as 30 caste-Hindus. Related News: Dalit AIADMK MLA weds Brahmin woman to script new story Six months later when the caste-Hindu girl became a major, both the families agreed to her marriage with Suriyakumar, the couple did an inter-caste marriage. The girlтАЩs family then withdrew the case they had filed against Suriyakumar. But, the Dalits did not withdraw the Prevention of Atrocities (against SC/ST) Act case filed against caste-Hindus in the Ulagam village. The case came up for hearing on October 1. тАЬThey told us many times to withdraw the case. We did not want to withdraw the case because the caste-Hindus were neither the relatives of the girl nor did they belong to the girlтАЩs village. These caste-Hindu men were all from our own village. They assaulted us just because our man eloped with a caste-Hindu girl. They did not want one of us to do an inter-caste marriage,тАЭ says T Sethu, a villager. According to the villagers, the decision to order a social boycott of the 29 Dalit families was taken at the village caste panchayat. тАЬThey did not hear our side at all. We are suffering just because we stood up for ourselves,тАЭ adds Sethu. Related News: Do cities offer safe abode for Dalits from villages like Hathras? Yes, and no The Dalit families also alleged that casteist slurs are hurled at them whenever they go past the houses of caste-Hindus. тАЬWe donтАЩt intentionally pass by their houses. But, when we went to get groceries and ration products from the ration shop located in a street with a predominantly caste-Hindu population, a few men abused us using our caste name and asked us not to step into the caste-Hindu streets,тАЭ says another woman from the Ulagam village. The village caste panchayat has also ordered that a fine of Rs 5,000 will be collected from people who gives groceries, milk and water to the Dalit people in the village. When asked about it, District Revenue Officer Gunasekaran said he was not aware of the incident and that an inquiry would be conducted into the matter.","IND","dalit",1,2,NA,NA

S Rajeswari, president of the Vanniyar-dominated Therkuthittai village in Cuddalore district, has alleged that she was made to sit on the floor during meetings of the panchayat board by the vice-president ever since she was elected to the post in January this year. As photos of Rajeswari sitting on the floor while members of the Therkuthittai village panchayat sitting on chairs during a meeting held on July 17 went viral on social media, the district administration swung into action on Saturday. A case under various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act has been filed against vice-president Mohanrajan and the panchayat secretary Sindhuja, who has been placed under suspension. District Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri and Cuddalore District Superintendent of Police M Sree Abhinav held discussions with the panchayat president and are investigating the incident. As photos of Rajeswari sitting on the floor while members of the Therkuthittai village panchayat sitting on chairs went viral on social media, the district police swung into action on Saturday. A case under various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act has been filed against vice-president Mohanrajan and the panchayat secretary. тАЬThe President of the panchayat has filed a complaint on Saturday morning and a case has been filed. We are investigating into the incident and we will ensure strict action against those who have erred,тАЭ Cuddalore District Superintendent of Police M Sree Abhinav told DH. The incident in Cuddalore district has come to light within two months of a panchayat president in Tiruvallur district near Chennai being not allowed to unfurl the national flag on the occasion of Independence Day. However, V Amurtham, president of Aathupaakam village, hoisted the tricolour five days later at the intervention of the district administration. Speaking to DH from Therkuthittai village, around 240 km from here, Rajeswari said the vice-president never allowed her to discharge her duties as the president and even prevented her from hoisting the national flag on the Independence Day. тАЬWe have had four meetings since January and in all the meetings I was asked to sit on the floor while the vice-president and four members of the panchayat belonging to the dominant caste sat on chairs. The fifth member from the SC community was also not allowed to sit on a chair. They want me to be inferior to them,тАЭ Rajeswari said. The village consists of around 500 families who are mostly Vanniyars and 100 households from the SC community. The panchayat is reserved for SC community. RajeswariтАЩs husband Saravanakumar said the family did not muster the courage to speak out against the discrimination due to fear.

Thirumavalavan said he has information that at least 10 panchayat presidents belonging to Scheduled Castes are being discriminated against by dominant castes in the villages. тАЬOnly a few incidents of discrimination against Dalit panchayat leaders come out in public. The dominant castes do not allow these leaders to function,тАЭ he said. Thirumavalavan also demanded that the Tamil Nadu government take steps to check whether 2,800 panchayat presidents belonging to the SC community are able to exercise their responsibility and publish a тАЬwhite paperтАЭ on the issue. тАЬBut the incidents in the past few weeks forced us to come out and express our anguish. The vice-president openly tells me and my wife that we are inferior to him and should keep away from the village administration,тАЭ he said. It began with Saravanakumar keeping the keys of the over-head tank of the village in his possession and the vice-president questioning the move. тАЬWe locked and the key was with us. But they used casteist slurs to attack us and get back the key. It is then we decided enough is enough and that we cannot tolerate anymore,тАЭ Saravanakumar said.

According to reports, the incident happened around four months ago but the victim reported the matter to the police yesterday after the culprits allegedly circulated a video of the incident that they had recorded. The victim had reportedly taken her goats for grazing when the incident happened four months ago. The culprits named Ratnaram Chawdhery son of Dargaram, Bheekharam Patel son of Chatraram and Narayanram son of Sanklaram threatened her with a knife and gang-raped her. They recorded a video of the act using victimтАЩs phone and then transferred it to one of the culpritsтАЩ phone. The victim kept mum because the culprits had her video. They also asked her to bring four other girls along and not to tell anyone about the incident. A case has been filed by the police against the culprits on the victimтАЩs information. A medical examination of the victim was conducted in Ahor Hospital. The police are on the lookout for the culprits. According to police, the accused had gangraped the 18-year old victim around four months ago and had filmed the act. Later on, when the victim failed to bring four other girls to them, they circulated the video of the gangrape on social media. The Congress-ruled state has witnesses several cases of rape in this month alone.

A 13-year-old Dalit girl in Khammam district of Telangana is battling for her life after she was set on fire allegedly by her employer├в┬А┬Щs son for resisting his sexual advances. The minor girl has sustained 70% burn injuries. Though the incident took place on September 18, it came to light on Monday after the girl disclosed the incident to her parents. According to the police, the victim, a native of Pallegudem village, Khammam district, was working as a domestic help at the house of Allam Subbarao. On September 18, Subbaro├в┬А┬Щs son, Allam Maraiah, allegedly tried to rape her. However, as she refused to give in, Maraiah set her on fire and fled from the spot, police said. The victim was then admitted in a private hospital for treatment by Subbarao├в┬А┬Щs family, and they tried to bury the incident. A few days ago, the family told the victim├в┬А┬Щs parents that their daughter suffered injuries while doing work. Her father immediately rushed to the hospital. However, as the victim was in an unconscious state, she could not reveal the crime. Fortunately, the victim regained consciousness on Monday, and shared the entire incident to her father. Subsequently, he filed a complaint with the One Town police station. She reportedly told her father, ""When I was in the room, he came inside and asked me to sleep with him. When I refused, he forced himself on me. I struggled a lot. He tore my clothes and later set me ablaze and ran away from the place.""

Later, after the postmortem report confirmed sexual assault, the charge of rape under IPC section 376 was added to the FIR. тАЬOn Wednesday, the FIR was registered under section 302 of the IPC. On Thursday, we have added section 376 (rape) of the IPC based on the postmortem report.

(Photo | PTI) As discussion on Dalit rights gain momentum in the aftermath of Hathras gangrape case, 'JusticeForDrPayal' trended on Twitter in light of Supreme Court's recent judgement on Dr. Payal Tadvi's suicide case. On October 8, the apex court permitted the three accused, in a case of suicide by Dr. Payal Tadvi in May 2019 due to alleged caste-based discrimination, to go back to the college and hospital and pursue their post-graduate studies. The three - Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehare and Ankita Khandelwal who were arrested in connection with the case last year, are reportedly set to return to their colleges on October 12. The apex court relaxed one of the conditions imposed on them by the Bombay High Court, which had granted them bail in August last year and said that they shall not enter into the jurisdiction of the concerned police station and more particularly the college. Calling the development a 'travesty of justice' social activist and politician, Prakash Ambedkar, questioned the 'impunity' and 'unaccountability' of those accused. Allowing the 3 accused doctors in the institutional murder of Dr. Payal Tadvi to enter the college for carrying on their life as usual is a travesty of justice. The impunity and unaccountability of people accused of caste based violence is utterly shameful. #JusticeForDrPayal Other Twitter users too took to the platform to voice their anger and angst on the subtle but apparent 'casteism' prevalent in the Indian society and expressed dismay over how Maharashtra had 'failed' Payal Tadvi.

"727",6595,"https://ruralindiaonline.org/articles/a-dalit-goes-to-court---1/","A Dalit goes to court ├втВмтАЬ 1","What happens when a Dalit seeks justice from the courts? Most times, the struggle may be just getting there, or charges are not framed years after a crime. This two-part story, done almost 20 years ago, is very relevant now with nationwide protests against the recent dilution of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act When Bhanwari DeviтАЩs 13 year-old daughter was raped in the bajra fields by an upper caste youth, she picked up a lathi and went after the rapist herself. She had no faith in the police and courts. Either way, she was prevented from seeking any redress by the dominant castes of Ahiron ka Rampura. тАЬThe village caste panchayat promised me justice,тАЭ she says. тАЬInstead, they threw me and my family out of Rampura.тАЭ Nearly a decade after the rape, no one in this village in Ajmer district has been punished. It doesnтАЩt mean much, though, in Rajasthan . On average in this state, one Dalit woman is raped every 60 hours. Data from reports of the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes show that nearly 900 cases of sexual assault of SC women were registered with the police between 1991 and 1996. ThatтАЩs round 150 cases a year тАУ or one every 60 hours. (Barring a few months of PresidentтАЩs rule, the state was entirely in Bharatiya Janata Party control through this period.) The numbers donтАЩt measure the reality. In this state, the extent of under-reporting of such crimes is perhaps the worst in the country. In Naksoda of Dholpur district, the victim of one of the most dramatic atrocities has fled the village. In April 1998, Rameshwar Jatav, a Dalit, sought the return of Rs. 150 that he had loaned an upper caste Gujjar. That was asking for trouble. Enraged by his arrogance, a band of Gujjars pierced his nose and put a ring of two threads of jute, a metre long and 2 mm thick, through his nostrils. Then they paraded him around the village, leading him by the ring. The incident hit the headlines and caused national outrage. It was widely reported overseas as well, both in print and on television. All that publicity, however, had no impact in ensuring justice. Terror within the village and a hostile bureaucracy at the ground level saw to that. And with the sensational and spectacular out of the way, the press lost interest in the case. So, apparently, did the human rights groups. The victims faced the post-media music on their own. Rameshwar completely changed his line in court. Yes, the atrocity had happened. However, it was not the six people named in his complaint who had done it. He could not identify the guilty. The senior medical officer, who had recorded the injuries in detail, now pleaded forgetfulness. Yes, Rameshwar had approached him with those wounds. He could not remember, though, if the victim had told him how he had come by those unusual injuries. RameshwarтАЩs Jatav's parents at their home in Naksoda village, where Jatav was paraded with a jute ring in his nostril: 'We live here in terror' RameshwarтАЩs father, Mangi Lal, has himself turned hostile as a witness. тАЬWhat do you expect us to do?тАЭ he asked me in Naksoda. тАЬWe live here in terror. The authorities were totally against us. The Gujjars can finish us any time. Various powerful people, and some in the police, forced this on us.тАЭ Rameshwar has left the village. Mangi Lal has sold one of the just three bigha s of land the family owns to meet the costs of the case thus far. For the world, it was a barbaric act. In Rajasthan, it just falls into one of thousands of 'Other IPC' (Indian Penal Code) cases. Which means cases other than murder, rape, arson or grievous hurt. Between 1991-96, there was one such case registered every four hours. In Sainthri in Bharatpur district, residents say there have been no marriages for seven years. Not of the men, at least. ThatтАЩs how its been since June 1992, when Sainthri was stormed by a rampaging upper caste mob. Six people were murdered and many houses destroyed. Some of those killed were burned alive when the bittora (store of dung and fuelwood) they were hiding in was deliberately set alight. In Sainthri village, a similar dung and fuelwood bittora in a shed was stormed by a rampaging upper caste mob, killing six people тАЬThe women of Sainthri are able to get married because they leave the village when they do so,тАЭ says Bhagwan Devi. тАЬBut not the men. Some men have left this village to get married. People donтАЩt want to send their daughters here. They know that if we are attacked again, no one, neither police nor courts, will help us.тАЭ Her cynicism is grounded in reality. Seven years after the murders, charges are yet to be framed in the matter. That too, doesnтАЩt mean much. One Dalit is murdered in this state a little over every nine days. In the same village lives Tan Singh, a survivor of the bittora fire ( see cover image ). The medical record shows he suffered 35 per cent burns in that event. His ears have been more or less destroyed. The little compensation he got тАУ because his brother was one of those killed тАУ has long ago disappeared in medical expenses. тАЬI had to sell my tiny plot of land to meet the costs,тАЭ says the devastated young man. That includes several hundreds of rupees each time on repeated trips to Jaipur тАУ on just travel alone. Tan Singh has become just a statistic . A Dalit is the victim of grievous hurt every 65 hours in this state. In Raholi in Tonk district, an attack on Dalits incited by local school teachers saw several cases of arson. тАЬThe losses were very bad,тАЭ says Anju Phulwaria. She was the elected тАУ Dalit тАУ sarpanch , but, she says, тАЬI was suspended from the post on false charges.тАЭ SheтАЩs not surprised that no oneтАЩs been punished for the act. On average, one dalit house or property suffers an arson attack every five days in Rajasthan. In every category, the chances of the guilty being punished are very few. Anju Phulwaria was the elected Dalit sarpanch of Raholi but, she says, 'I was suspended from the post on false charges' What do the figures say? Former Janata Dal Member of Parliament Than Singh was a member of a committee investigating crimes against Dalits in the early '90s. тАЬThe conviction rate was around three per cent,тАЭ he told me at his Jaipur residence. In Dholpur district, where I visited the courts, I found it to be even less. In all, 359 such cases were committed to Sessions between 1996 and 1998. Some had been transferred to other courts or were pending. But the conviction rate here was under 2.5 per cent. A senior police officer in Dholpur told me: тАЬMy only regret is that the courts are burdened with so many false issues. Well over 50 per cent of SC /ST complaints are false. People are put to needless harassment by such cases.тАЭ His is a widely held view among the largely upper caste police officers of Rajasthan. (A senior government official refers to the force as the CRP тАУ the тАЬCharang-Rajput Police.тАЭ These two powerful castes dominated the force right up to the '90s.) The idea that ordinary people, particularly the poor and weak, are liars is deep-rooted in the police. Take rape cases across all communities. The national average of such cases found to be false after investigation is around five per cent of the total. In Rajasthan, rape cases declared тАЬfalseтАЭ average around 27 per cent. This is like saying that women in the state tend to lie five times more than women in the rest of the country. The more likely explanation? A huge bias against women is deeply embedded in the system. The тАШfalse rapeтАЩ data covers all communities. But a detailed survey would likely establish that Dalits and Adivasis are the worst victims of that bias. Simply: the level of atrocities they suffer is far higher than other communities. I had been assured everywhere I went in Rajasthan that Dalits were grossly misusing the law in general and the provisions of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, in particular. Above all, the much feared Section 3 of the Act under which those guilty of casteist offences against Dalits and Adivasis can be imprisoned for up to five years along with a fine. In reality, I could not find a single case where such serious punishment had been meted out to offenders. In Dholpur itself, the few punishments handed out in cases generally involving offences against Dalits seemed unlikely to deter the guilty. They ranged from fines of Rs.100 or Rs. 250 or Rs. 500 to one monthтАЩs simple imprisonment. The most severe punishment I came across was six months simple imprisonment. In one case, the guilty had been put on тАЬprobationтАЭ with bail. The concept of probation is one this reporter had never run into in such cases anywhere else. DholpurтАЩs is not an isolated instance. At the SC / ST Special Court in Tonk district headquarters, we learned that the conviction rate was just under two per cent. So much for the numbers. What are the steps and the barriers, the process and the perils facing a dalit going to court? ThatтАЩs another story. This two-part story was originally published in The Hindu on June 13, 1999.

Leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Bharatiya Janata Party state president K Surendran called on the mother who is staging a dharna outside her home in Palakkad district. тАЬIt is worse than the Hathras case in Uttar Pradesh. People who shed tears are ignoring two murders that happened in their own backyard. It is sad the mother is forced to begin another round of stir,тАЭ said Chennithala. He sought action against police officers who reportedly sabotaged the case. The two sisters aged 12 and eight were found hanging in their home in a span of 52 days in Walayar when their parents went for work in 2017. The case had seen many twists and turns since then. Last month the Kerala Government had informed the high court that the case was not investigated properly and it was ready for a re-investigation. The mother had approached the HC for a court-monitored central agency probe. Amid the latest protest, the stepfather of the girls alleged that he was forced to own up the crime by the investigating officer and that he was feeling suicidal. He said police want to protect the perpetrators of the crime so they were on the lookout for scapegoats. тАЬI was threatened several times by the police. They backed out when I told them that I would die by suicide,тАЭ he said. Kerala law minister A K Balan said the government has limitations as the case was in the court now. The ruling CPI(M) also maintained that the party supports the mother of the two girls but opposition parties were using her for political reasons. The autopsy report had found that both girls were subjected to sexual assaults. The older girl died on January 13, 2017 and the younger one 52 days later. After the death of the older girl, the mother had named a few accused but the police failed to take any action which led to the second death, she alleged. Though both died under mysterious circumstances there was a concerted effort to dismiss the deaths as suicide. тАЬI will die on the street fighting for justice. When I met the CM a couple of months back he said there will be a CBI probe. I feel cheated now,тАЭ said the mother. She also said that the police officers who тАШweakenedтАЩ the case were recently promoted. Both she and her husband work as labourers. Last year a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) court had set free four accused and passed serious strictures against the investigating team. But the police officer who headed the investigation was promoted later. The acquittals sparked indignation in the state after which the high court took up the case suo moto but proceedings were stalled again after the government announced a judicial commission. A lawyer N Rajesh, who represented one of the accused in the case, was later appointed as district child welfare committee president, a body aimed at protecting rights of children. During trial many witnesses were also turned hostile and they were not booked. While acquitting the accused the court had passed strictures against the prosecution. The prosecutor was also sacked later. The ruling CPI(M) is facing criticism as most of the accused are reported to be party workers.

Will there be change on the ground?├В┬а","Jump to navigation Speak Now The Hathras incident and its aftermath have triggered some burning questions. Do Dalit lives matter? What's it that the Yogi government is trying to hide? Will there be change on the ground? On India Today TV Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai's show News Today at 9, political leaders and Dalit activists answer these and more such questions. When asked if what has happened in Hathras is appropriate, BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""The UP government has been sensitive. The accused have been arrested. An SIT has been formed. It will be a fast-track trial."" Reacting to it, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, ""There was no FIR in the Hathras case for eight days. The DM threatened the victim's family and the media. The ADG said there was no rape because no semen was found on the victim's body. This, despite her dying declaration that she was raped. It's criminal the way cops cremated the body. When will big heads roll? The buck stops with the CM."" ALSO READ: Hathras is now Peepli Live, justice byword for vote bank politics Asked if the protest is about Dalit identity, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani said, ""In the last six years, some anti-socials from upper castes have felt that they can get away with anything. There were so many cases even before Hathras."" Is this a political battle for the Dalit vote? AAP MLA Atishi responded to this question and said, ""Today, at Jantar Mantar, we saw a citizen protest, despite a pandemic. People's blood is boiling.""When asked if the protest is meant to corner the Yogi government, she said, ""There is a complete complicity of the UP administration with the perpetrators of the crime."" So, what makes this case stand out? Joining the debate, Dalit activist Beena Pallical said that this is not the first such case in UP. ""Look at the data. And, today, an upper caste group held a demonstration in Hathras to support the accused."" Sudhanshu Trivedi said that Dalits have been killed in other states too but people only see selective outrage. Reacting to this charge, Jignesh Mevani said, ""Dalit lives matter to us, no matter where such cases happen. I want to ask why the Centre hasn't run a campaign to end the caste system and untouchability."" Supriya Shrinate also hit back at Sudhanshu Trivedi and asked why the BJP doesn't talk about the current situation. ""Crime against women in UP has gone up by 40 per cent,"" she charged. When both Supriya Shrinate and Jignesh Mevani asked why the PM was not even tweeting about the Hathras case, Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""It would have been a problem if our leaders had been partisan by talking about crime in select states.""

"730",6611,"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/opinion-why-dalit-women-should-reclaim-telanganas-bathukamma-festival-136072","Opinion: Why Dalit women should reclaim Telangana's Bathukamma festival","Examining the rationality of the different claims surrounding the history of the festival is futile, but beneath it, is a larger question. Whose culture is it? Bathukamma Bathukamma, Valalo Bathukaagamaaye, Valalo...Vaadala Bathukamma Valalo Medala Paalaye, Valalo..(Dear Bathukamma, your life has been left in chaos. The Bathukamma of the streets is now in forts and mansions). These lines are from a song written and composed by popular Dalit singer Epuri Somanna and explain what he calls a cultural onslaught in contemporary times against Bathukamma, a popular festival of flowers in Telangana that usually takes place between the second half of September and the first half of October. Early human societies architectured certain cultural practices that were not codified. It was later in human history that authority emerged in the guise of religion and other associated forms. Many aboriginal, peasant communities, despite threats of dominance and colonisation, have succeeded in maintaining their indigenous cultural practices across the globe, and the same can be said for Bathukamma.  An undetachable bond with flowers, nature and music is the focus of the Bathukamma celebration around production. Bathukamma is celebrated by making a hill-shaped arrangement of different coloured flowers along with turmeric powder and kumkuma. Women dance around the arrangements in a circular or semi-circular pattern, clapping continuously in a rhythmic fashion, breathing life into the songs. On the ninth day of the celebrations, they drop their respective flower arrangements/Bathukammas in a lake or water body of the village, followed by a feast at the shore.  Telangana's production castes (communities who are in the agriculture) and mainly those categorised as Backward Classes (BCs), have traditionally celebrated the festival. Till some time ago, Dalit women in some places celebrated it separately or were not allowed to celebrate it even in their own settlements. Though the situation has changed to some extent after the formation of Telangana, as it was declared as a state festival, we still see sporadic incidents of Dalits being shunned when they attempt to participate in the festival in the public sphere. This year, however, there has been a fundamental change. A group of Brahmin priests under the banner of the ""Vidwat Sabha"" intervened to decide the dates of the celebration, paving way to a new 'method', as until now, the dates were not decided by priests. This bid is nothing but an attempt to appropriate, if not hijack, the culture of peasant castes and especially women. Examining the rationality of the different claims surrounding the history of the festival is a futile exercise, but beneath it, is a larger philosophical and political question. Whose culture is it? History/Histories of Bathukamma Unlike other mainstream religious festivals or celebrations, Bathukamma is unique as it celebrates life by the arrangement of a variety of flowers. Some of the popular narratives, by way of songs, suggest that it was started in the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty while others claim that Bathukamma was a gift by goddess Lakshmi Devi to a Chola king, Dharmanga, after the death of his 100 sons. Some songs, which are sung at the time of the celebrations, are in praise of goddess Parvathi or Varalakshmi. These songs keep changing and differ from place to place based on the popular history in the region. Vedic chants or words such as ├в┬А┬Шmuhurtam├в┬А┬Щ (auspicious time) are not heard in the celebrations as the people celebrate as per their convenience. Historically, it has been the elite class who have controlled the cultural narrative. The stories of those below them in the hierarchy were not told, heard or documented because it was prohibited. Many elderly Dalit people claim that the Bathukamma celebration was historically part of the culture of their ancestors and that it was somehow taken away from them.  But will any one ""sell off"" their culture? And that too for nothing? Observers from the community say that their cultural practices were taken away by force and that the community was convinced to believe that it was not their culture in the first place. One of the ways in which this was done, they say, was through stories. One folk story involves pieces of roasted beef, a crow and a Madiga (Dalit sub-caste) woman who was working as a vetti labourer (bonded labour) at a fort owned by a feudal lord. According to this story, the Madiga woman, who was well-known for her nuance in singing, was stealing the show at every Bathukamma festival. Disgruntled by her presence, some (dominant castes) waited for an opportunity to prohibit her from the gathering. On one occasion, the Madiga woman is said to have rushed from bonded work at the fort to the Bathukamma celebration while carrying roasted beef pieces. As the celebration was set to begin, a crow came flying and knocked down the woman├в┬А┬Щs Bathukamma, before fleeing with a piece of beef. The village resolved that the Madiga woman and her fellow women should not take part in the celebration in the future, claiming that the incident was the sign of a curse from goddess Bathukamma. From then on, Dalit women never reclaimed their right over Bathukamma. Or so, the story goes. Prof Kancha Ilaiah, a prominent social scientist who comes from a shepherd community in Telangana, observed in his book Why I am not a Hindu, ""The violent, hegemonic, brahminical culture sought to destroy Dalit Bahujan productive structure, culture, economy and its positive political institutions. Everything was attacked and undermined.├в┬А┬Э In Bathukamma├в┬А┬Щs case, the Dalit-Bahujan culture has been hijacked, and is being given a colour which is strange to the traditional practice, in the interests of dominat sections. Should the festival be reclaimed? Whether one accepts or dumps the legends, citing academic reasons, everyone has to accept that Dalit women have a right to culture and especially a right to celebrate Bathukamma, as much as any other community celebrating it.  Politically, it is a welcome sign to see Dalit women in some places celebrating Bathukamma near BR Ambedkar statues or at their community halls or by keeping his portrait in the midst of Bathukammas. It may not prove beneficial immediately, but it is possible to imagine that they have absorbed the spirit of Ambedkar's revolutionary thoughts by placing his portrait at the centre of their celebrations, and tomorrow, they may recite the Preamble of the Indian Constitution through which he wanted to liberate them. For the last few years, Vimalakka, a revolutionary singer and activist of the Arunodaya Cultural Federation, has been organising ├в┬А┬ШBahujana Bathukamma├в┬А┬Щ in a large-scale manner across the state. In fact, a similar event was also organised in front of the Osmania University Arts College building, which was at the epicentre of the Telangana agitation for separate statehood. A section of intellectuals in Dalit studies observed the phenomenon and have dubbed it as ├в┬А┬Шsanskritisation├в┬А┬Щ and warned people not to fall into a trap. However, one could argue that this claim falls flat as Dalit women are simply reclaiming and re-asserting a culture that was once theirs. This process of reclaiming and reasserting one├в┬А┬Щs culture will challenge the Hindutva forces that are trying to brand Bathukamma as a religious festival. Their embrace of the festival must be studied in the context of their communal, divisive mentality ├в┬А┬Ф they're happily willing to cite the atrocities committed on women during the Nizam era while clearly undermining the role of dominant caste feudal landlords in the same time/period.

As the fight showed no sign of flagging, the elders of one of the boys, dominant caste as it turned out, decided to get involved. The Dalit boy, after all, had to be shown his place. The men from the dominant caste caught hold of the Dalit boyтАЩs mother. They stripped her and paraded her through the village. The womanтАЩs mother and daughter tried to intervene and were thrashed. Finally, the village sarpanch stepped in and a bystander offered the woman a shawl. An FIR was filed, but the accused got bail. This story was narrated by the womanтАЩs husband at a conference organised in New Delhi by the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch a few years ago. But the reality of living as a Dalit woman in India hasnтАЩt changed. Tucked inside the newspapers тАФ if at all тАФ it filters through stories of everyday, routine indignities. Somewhere a sarpanch is denied a chair on the podium during a Republic Day function. A brideтАЩs palanquin takes the long route home so as to not pollute the roads that dominant castes tread on. Shopkeepers fling purchases made by Dalit customers. Temples and common water sources are barred. Just another day in the life of a Dalit. The outrage over Hathras is justified and necessary. But there is nothing new about the systemic oppression of Dalit women aided by State-backed institutions: The police who wonтАЩt file FIRs, lawyers who urge rape survivors to compromise, a legal system that exhausts the patience of the most stoic victim, and a media that finds no merit in these stories. To say, тАЬdonтАЩt make this about casteтАЭ is ignorance and privilege. Of course, it is about caste. Of course, there is a power dynamic. Would there have been mere outrage and not a raging lynch mob if four Dalit men had attacked a Thakur woman in a similar fashion? Would the police have locked an upper caste family inside their home and denied them access to their daughterтАЩs cremation? Caste is modern IndiaтАЩs dirtiest little secret. It has a grip so insidious that parents will kill their own daughters for falling in love with men from the тАЬwrongтАЭ caste; a grip so normalised that in 2014, IndiaтАЩs biggest caste survey found one in four Indians freely admitted to practising some form of untouchability. Of all the ghastly visuals that emerged from Hathras, the one that broke my heart is the one where the sister-in-law of the 19-year-old Dalit girl is running behind the district magistrateтАЩs official white car as he leaves the village in a plume of dust. An Indian citizen, guaranteed equality by the Constitution, is chasing IndiaтАЩs new rulers like a supplicant in a feudal autocracy, begging for the most basic human right тАФ dignity in death.

"734",6635,"https://caravanmagazine.in/caste/dalits-protested-hathras-crime-funeral-ritual","How Dalits from villages across India protested the Hathras crime with a funeral ritual"," In October, Martin Macwan, a Dalit activist organised a tribute to the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gangraped and assaulted in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Macwan is one of the founders of a Gujarat-based non-profit, Dalit Foundation, which works for the empowerment of Dalit communities. In a programme named Bhim Kanya, people across villages in several states including Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana, predominantly from Dalit communities, applied turmeric on representational images of the 19-year-old woman. According to Macwan, over thirty thousand people, across a thousand villages, participated in the programme held on 14 October. On 1 October, a division bench of the Allahabad High Court took suo moto cognisance of the Hathras crime. The court said that the incidents following the Dalit womanтАЩs death on 29 September had shocked its conscience. Unfazed by the pleas of the victimтАЩs family or the presence of the media, local police officials had burned her body late at night and prevented her family from performing her last rites. The bench said that the Hathras victim was entitled to тАЬhonourable, decent and dignified last rites/cremation to be performed by her family members in keeping with the customs and traditions followed by the family.тАЭ Among other things, the court noted that the victimтАЩs mother wished to apply turmeric on her as part of the last rites but was not allowed to do so. Macwan said that society believed that тАЬDalits do not even have the last wish.тАЭ He described the significance of the turmeric ritual among Dalit communities and why it was central to the programme. тАЬThis is a cultural issue that whenever people die without marriage, they apply haldi because that was something to be applied at the time of wedding.тАЭ The banner designed for the event read, тАЬDalit bitiya ko izzat se jeene bhi nahi diya, izzat se marne bhi nahi diyaтАЭтАФThe Dalit daughter was neither allowed to live with dignity, nor die with dignity. The idea was for the participants at the programmes to apply turmeric to copies of this poster. In villages where the posters could not be accessed, they drew their own depiction of the Dalit woman. Macwan said that it was necessary to mobilise people in rural areas. The Dalit Foundation discovered that many did not know of what happened in Hathras until they were informed by the organisationтАЩs grassroots volunteers. тАЬTo the surprise of our colleagues, the amount of response that came from women was something they have not been able to understand,тАЭ Macwan added. Describing the turmeric ritual as a culturally powerful medium, he said, тАЬWhen women brought out the haldi from their own houses and when they were applying it, they went through that personal experience as if they are doing that to their own loved ones. And something they have suffered themselves as being women, as Dalit women.тАЭ While people from Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes participated in large numbers, Macwan said that the participation of women from the Valmiki community was particularly remarkable. The 19-year-old from Hathras was from a Valmiki community, which is a Dalit sub-caste. тАЬNormally they are never part of these programmes,тАЭ he said. тАЬWe saw that it was these women who were explaining to the other people that what wrong had happened. They understood it better than what I could describe. This was the reason why we did this programme, it had to be symbolic, yet very powerful and also give a political message.тАЭ The choice of date to hold the Bhim Kanya programme was also significantтАФit was on 14 October 1956 that BR Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in Nagpur along with lakhs of followers.

Chitrakoot Superintendent of Police (SP) Ankit Mittal said the 15-year-old girl hanged herself in her house in the Manikpur area on Tuesday. After the girl's death, her family members alleged that she was raped by three men in a forest area on October 8, the officer said. On the basis of a complaint from the victim's family members, a former village head's son Kishan Upadhyay and two others -- Ashish and Satish -- were arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Mittal said. The family members alleged that the girl ended her life as her complaint was not registered, a charge denied by the police, who said that the victim's kin had not given any application to lodge an FIR. The SP said the post-mortem did not confirm rape and the samples would now be sent to a Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL). The girl will be cremated on Wednesday in the village, where elaborate security arrangements have been made. The victim's father alleged that after raping his daughter, the accused left her with her hands and legs tied and the police brought her home, but did not register an FIR. The incident comes close on the heels of a 19-year-old Dalit woman succumbing in a Delhi hospital after allegedly being raped by four upper-caste men in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district, triggering a nationwide outrage.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Friday said the country has lost one of the greatest Dalit and socialist leaders in Ram Vilas Paswan. Paswan (74), the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, died at a hospital in Delhi on Thursday, days after he underwent a heart surgery. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also paid his last tributes to the departed leader and visited the latterтАЩs place. Gandhi said Paswan raised voice for the most marginalised sections in society and left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and the country. In a letter to Chirag Paswan, son of the late Union minister, Manmohan Singh described him as an important Dalit face in the central government. ""In his death our country has lost one of its greatest Dalit and socialist leaders, who always stood for the cause of the poor and downtrodden people of the society,"" Singh said in his condolences. ""Ram Vilas Paswan ji was a very important Dalit face in the central government, of many parties. I have very warm recollections of my association with Shri Paswan ji as a member of the UPA Government which I led in 2004. ""The veteran socialist leader, Paswan ji was also a very efficient administrator who worked very closely with me as Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers, and also served as minister in various ministries,"" the former PM said. Singh said Paswan was a mass leader which is evident from the fact that he won Parliament elections with a record majority from his constituency. He said Paswan was also a leader who was loved and respected by all with whom he came into contact with, irrespective of their political leniency. Rahul Gandhi, in a letter to Chirag Paswan, said he was deeply saddened by the sudden demise of his father. ""We have lost a veteran leader who left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and our nation. ""In an illustrious public life spanning over five decades, he was the voice of the most marginalised sections of our society and defended the rights of the poor and the vulnerable,"" he said in his letter. Gandhi said as a Member of Parliament and Union minister, Paswan voiced the interests and concerns of the poor with passion. ""His unwavering commitment to social justice and equality is particularly relevant in these times. His enduring legacy will continue to inspire people dedicated to public service,"" the Congress leader added.

He is the first player in the ongoing season of Indian Premier League to make this gesture. After reaching his half-century in the 19th over, he went down on a knee with his right arm raised to show solidarity with the movement against racism. West Indies all-rounder and Mumbai's stand-in skipper Kieron Pollard responded by raising his right fist. Social media instantly reacted. While Pandya was being lauded for showing support to the global anti-racist movement, he has been widely called out on social media for not taking a stand against the caste atrocities, discrimination against minorities and violence against women. Twitterati were quick to point out the duality of his solidarity act. What about Dalit lives, many people asked on Twitter.

Last week, West Indies Test skipper Jason Holder, who plays for the Sunrisers Hyderbad, had expressed his disappointment over none of the IPL teams taking a knee in solidarity with the movement, which, he felt, went unnoticed in the league. ""To be honest, I haven't had one conversation up here around it (BLM). Sometimes it seems it has gone unnoticed, which is a sad thing. ""I guess it's for us to re-highlight the importance of it, for people to understand what is happening in the world,"" Holder had said. The ""taking a knee"" gesture started in the West Indies' Test series in England this summer in protest against racism after African-American George Floyd was killed by an on-duty white police officer in Minneapolis. But the gesture was later discontinued for the subsequent tours of Pakistan and Australia.","IND","dalit",1,2,NA,NA

Published: 14th October 2020 09:56 AM | Last Updated: 14th October 2020 09:56 AM | A+A A- For representational purposes (Express Illustrations) CHITRAKOOT: A Dalit teenage girl, who was allegedly raped by three men, has ended her life by hanging herself in this district of Uttar Pradesh, officials said. Chitrakoot Superintendent of Police (SP) Ankit Mittal said the 15-year-old girl hanged herself in her house in the Manikpur area on Tuesday. After the girl's death, her family members alleged that she was raped by three men in a forest area on October 8, the officer said. On the basis of a complaint from the victim's family members, a former village head's son Kishan Upadhyay and two others -- Ashish and Satish -- were arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Mittal said. The family members alleged that the girl ended her life as her complaint was not registered, a charge denied by the police, who said that the victim's kin had not given any application to lodge an FIR. The SP said the post-mortem did not confirm rape and the samples would now be sent to a Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL). The girl will be cremated on Wednesday in the village, where elaborate security arrangements have been made. The victim's father alleged that after raping his daughter, the accused left her with her hands and legs tied and the police brought her home, but did not register an FIR. The incident comes close on the heels of a 19-year-old Dalit woman succumbing in a Delhi hospital after allegedly being raped by four upper-caste men in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district, triggering a nationwide outrage.

"741",6673,"http://www.anticaste.in/the-murder-of-a-dalit-communist/","The murder of a Dalit communist","Communists Against Caste Chronicling the role and views of communists in the struggle for the annihilation of caste Twenty-six year old Sanoop U was hacked to death on Sunday night (4 October) reportedly by a gang of RSS, Bajrang Dal and BJP workers. Sanoop was the Secretary of the CPI(M)тАЩs Puthussery Colony branch in the Chovvannur panchayat of KeralaтАЩs Thrissur district. He belonged to a Dalit community, and was also the Joint Secretary of the Democratic Youth Federation of IndiaтАЩs (DYFI) Chovvanur Area Committee. Among the accused in SanoopтАЩs murder, Abhayjeet Arankott veettil, Karimpanackal Satheesh alias Marion, and Sreerag Aven veettil are reportedly active with the RSS-BJP. Another accused, Chittilangad Tharayil Nandanan is a Bajrang Dal leader who was earlier with the Indian National Congress. Bajrang Dal is the violent paramilitary wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, the RSSтАЩs тАЬreligiousтАЭ wing. The murder-accused were allegedly involved in a drug mafia backed by the Sangh Parivar. Nandanan is an accused in several criminal cases. Sanoop is the fourth left activist to be killed by right-wing forces in Kerala in the past seven weeks. CPI(M) activist Siyad (35) was killed in Kayamkulam (Alappuzha district) on 18 August. The killer was allegedly backed by the Congress тАУ Kaavil Nisam, a Municipal Councillor of the Congress was held for helping the murderer escape. Haq Muhammad (24) and Mithilaj (30), two activists of the DYFI, were murdered in Venjaramood (Thriuvananthapuram district) on 30 August, the night before Onam. Haq Muhammad was a CPI(M) member and the President of the DYFIтАЩs Kalingin Mukham Unit. Mithilaj was the Joint Secretary of DYFIтАЩs Thevalakkad Unit. Eight Congress workers were arrested in connection with their murder. On Sunday, Sanoop was busy with arrangements for the DYFIтАЩs food distribution programme at the Medical College Hospital, Thrissur. The DYFI has been distributing food packets to poor patients and their bystanders in medical colleges and district hospitals across Kerala every day. This programme, named тАШHridayapoorvamтАЩ (With All Our Heart), was launched in 2017, with DYFI committees taking turns to take responsibility to collect food packets from families who volunteer to contribute and to distribute them. The DYFIтАЩs Chovvannur Area Committee was in charge of the food distribution at the Medical College Hospital, Thrissur on Monday. Even as they were consumed by grief following SanoopтАЩs murder, DYFI activists ensured that the food distribution went ahead without interruption on Monday. Sanoop was orphaned at a young age тАУ his mother Sati passed away when he was three years old, and his father Unnikrishnan died soon after. He was brought up by Vilasini, his aunt. He took up construction work after his school years. As a political activist, he was in the forefront for all sorts of issues concerning the colony and its 57 families. Photos and videos of the people of the colony grieving for Sanoop have been widely circulated in the past two days. The entire Puthussery colony had become his family. A pattern seems to be emerging in the recent murders of communists in Kerala. The slain communists were all young, and popular in their areas. They were clearly seen as threats to the right-wing forces. Sanoop, for instance, was expected to play a pivotal role in the area during the upcoming panchayat and state elections. Eliminating young communist cadre and intimidating the rest seems to be part of the right-wing ploy. It is suspected that the attempt is also to provoke left activists into some sort of retaliation, although the CPI(M) leadership has been at pains to urge its cadre to exercise restraint. The violent attacks of the past few weeks have been entirely one-sided, having been directed against the communists by both the Congress and the RSS-BJP, the two main factions of the political right-wing. The calculation of the right forces is that the mainstream media would come to their aid as usual by playing down the murders of communists, as if they are lesser human beings. Even sections who are otherwise vocal about atrocities against Dalits largely tend to ignore the murders of Dalits who are communists, as evidenced by reactions to the murder of DYFI activist Asok in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu on 12 June 2019. Three other CPI(M) activists тАУ Vipin, Jithin and Abhijith тАУ have been injured in the sangh attack that resulted in SanoopтАЩs death. After postmortem, SanoopтАЩs body was received by CPI(M) leaders. The body was draped in the Red Flag by Central Committee member and Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch all-India President K Radhakrishnan, CPI(M) State Committee member P Rajeev, CPI(M) District Secretary AM Varghese, State Committee members AC Moideen, NR Balan, & PK Biju, DYFI State Secretary AA Rahim and DYFI State President S Satheesh. The cremation was done at the Santhitheeram, Shoranur at 8 pm on Monday. The decision to end Made Snana and Ede Snana at Udupi has come as a result of protracted struggles, sustained campaigns and continuous pressure on government authorities and religious heads to bring down the curtains on the degrading practices.

DYFI activists say that the murder of Ashok is in response to the role that he played in the resistance against the abuse of Dalit workers and women by reactionary elements of the dominant community, as he mobilised youth to fight caste oppression and discrimination in his village.

Kamalkishore's charred body was later found in a deep freezer of the liquor shop that was found gutted, police said. His brother Roop Singh lodged an FIR at Khairthal police station, where he mentioned that Kamalkishore was burnt to death when he asked for his salary dues from liquor contractors Subhash and Rakesh Yadav who are absconding. BJP state President Satish Poonia tweeted on Monday: ""It seems we are living in Somalia in Africa where there is no law and order. Does CM Ashok Gehlot have any right to retain his position."" He also put a hashtag CrimeCapitalRajasthan. The crime comes in the wake of burning alive of a temple priest in Rajasthan over a land dispute. According to the police, deceased Kamalkishore (22), a resident of Jhadka village in Alwar, died of burns on Saturday night in Kampur village. Police said that a forensics team visited the crime spot. ""The situation will be clear only after more evidence is gathered in the case,"" police said. Roop Singh alleged that Kamalkishore's salary was due for the last five months. He returned home but on Saturday evening, the contractors and his colleagues visited their house and took him along. Later in the night, he alleged, the liquor shop was set on fire by dousing it with petrol even while Kamalkishore was inside. On Sunday morning, when the vend shutters were broken open, Kamalkishore was found dead inside the freezer. Police took the body to the Khairthal Satellite Hospital for autopsy even as the family demanded the arrest of the contractors along with judicial investigation. The family did not allow the post-mortem till Sunday evening. After a day-long tussle, the body was finally handed over to the relatives after post-mortem.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

'Upwardly mobile, powerful' Dalit group at centre of Bihar polls buzz├В┬а","New Delhi: In the political landscape of Bihar, where caste identities often take precedence over most other factors, the position of one particular community has become the subject of much speculation ahead of the 2020 assembly polls тАФ the Paswans. The leader who represented them for over five decades тАФ former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) тАФ died earlier this month, and thereтАЩs much guesswork underway on who the community will choose in his stead. Will his son, MP and LJP chief Chirag Paswan, who brought all political calculations to naught just weeks before the elections by walking out of the NDA in Bihar, be able to inherit his fatherтАЩs loyal vote bank? And will the Paswan community, described by members as upwardly mobile, and relatively more powerful and better off than other Dalit groups in the state, continue to enjoy the same political significance they did under Ram Vilas Paswan, who held their place firm on the political map of Bihar, and even Delhi? As these questions await answers in the Bihar election results, ThePrint explains why the community is crucial for leaders eyeing power in the state. Also Read: BJP sticks to upper caste candidates for Bihar polls but keeps Yadavs in the mix Paswan is the surname of members of the Dusadh community, which constitutes an estimated 5 per cent of Bihar population, with around 45.6 lakh members. The Scheduled Castes (SCs) constitute 16 per cent of the stateтАЩs population. The Dusadhs account for over 30 per cent of the Dalit population, giving them numerical heft in the state тАФ the first factor to make any caste group dominant, according to Rahul Verma, fellow at the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research (CPR). The other two factors, according to Verma, are economic resources and political power. The Paswans, it is believed, have historically had access to both despite belonging to the lowest stratum in the caste hierarchy laid down in the Vedic mythology. тАЬThe Paswans are a martial and warrior race. There is a school of thought that they were the Gahlots (Rajputs) of Rajasthan, and they migrated from Rajasthan fighting the Mughals, and moved to the eastern parts of the country after being defeated, and refused to convert,тАЭ said Sanjay Paswan, a senior BJP leader and former Union minister. тАЬAfter the displacement, they lost their caste and social status.тАЭ Their martial roots are believed to have lent the community a distinctive physical prowess. The word Dusadh literally means one who cannot be controlled or is тАЬinsurmountableтАЭ. According to Paswan, when the British came to India and faced Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, they were advised to make use of the Dusadh community, which was considered physically strong, but socially oppressed, to defeat him. The British, he said, acted on the advice and won, defeating the Nawab in the 1757 Battle of Plassey. The British, according to experts and members of the community aware of its history, rewarded the Dusadhs by making them chowkidars (watchmen) or police informers for the colonial government. And here lies the origin of the name Paswan тАФ an Urdu word, which means bodyguard or тАЬnazdik ka rakshakтАЭ. During this era, the Paswans are believed to have primarily worked as lathi-wielding chowkidars or tax collectors for zamindars тАФ giving them early proximity to power. тАЬTab se hi satta ki bhook hai iss community mein (The community has had a hunger for power since those days),тАЭ Sanjay Paswan said. тАЬIf you see now also, you will find a lot of our people in police.тАЭ In the 1900s, when caste associations became a tool for different communities to demand social and political rights, the Paswans became the first Dalit group to form a caste association, and lay a claim on their purportedly lost Kshatriya status, said Badri Narayan, director of the G.B. Pant Social Science Institute, Allahabad. тАЬThey made a vibrant caste association by 1914тАж So, due to a host of factors like proximity to the landed class, the sahibs, and possessing lathi ki shakti (the might of the stick), etc, they emerged as a dominant, visible Dalit community,тАЭ he added. The bravery associated with the community finds a reflection in their rituals. тАЬOne of the more prominent of our rituals is to walk on fire,тАЭ said Sanjay Paswan, who made global headlines in 2003, when he was the Union junior minister for education, for walking barefoot over embers and brandishing swords. Asked what the connotation of the ritual is, he said, тАЬIt simply means we are Dusadh тАФ brave, not scared to play with fire.тАЭ Verma said the Dusadhs are the most тАЬSanskritisedтАЭ among Dalit communities. The term Sanskritisation denotes a sociological phenomenon where groups occupying the lower strata in the caste hierarchy seek upward mobility by emulating the rituals and practices of the upper castes. The historical closeness with power endowed the community with not just a sense of power themselves, but also aspiration. Sanjay Kumar, director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a Delhi-based research institute, said the community is socio-economically much more well-off than other Dalit communities. тАЬThey have been able to diversify their work. So, in addition to chowkidari work, they have small shops and businesses as well,тАЭ he added. Being the most dominant Dalit community in Bihar has also helped them emerge as among the biggest beneficiaries of reservation. тАЬAn important factor to remember is that, unlike other Dalits, they were not seen as untouchable,тАЭ said Kumar. тАЬSo, the upper castes would be okay to accept food or water from them because they were not seen to be engaged in тАШimpureтАЩ work.тАЭ Kumar said a better economic status vis-a-vis other Dalit groups had not translated into land ownership for the Dusadhs, but Narayan claimed their historical closeness with zamindars had allowed them to amass some land themselves. тАЬAnd, politically, they are aspirational as well. TheyтАЩve had their leaders since the British times,тАЭ Narayan added. The numerical strength of the Dusadhs, coupled with their social and relative economic might, contributed to their political significance from the very beginning, say experts. тАЬYou might say that they are just 4-5 per cent of BiharтАЩs population. But that is a formidable vote bank,тАЭ said Kumar. тАЬAs a caste group, their ability to shift the vote has been immense,тАЭ he added. тАЬIn Bihar, Dalits are more than 20 per cent in 20-45 constituencies, and, in the others, they are about 12-20 per cent. In a multi-cornered contest, this is a huge vote bank,тАЭ Kumar said. It was as early as 1968 when Bihar elected its first Dalit chief minister, Bhola Paswan Shastri of the Congress. тАЬThis was the time of Dalit unityтАж So, the Paswans and the Chamars (the largest Dalit group in Bihar) were united,тАЭ said Sanjay Paswan. тАЬThere was Jagjivan Ram (former deputy PM) at the Centre, and Bhola Paswan Shastri in the state.тАЭ But they were both from the Congress, and the 1960s were also the time when anti-Congressism started to spread across the country, with socialists-led ruling coalitions being cobbled up as purveyors of the social justice movement, and alternatives to the grand old party, he added. тАЬSo, the opposition needed a non-Congress Dalit leader, and that is when Ram Vilas Paswan emerged,тАЭ he said. Also Read: Hajipur to Delhi тАФ Ram Vilas Paswan always made sure my camera caught his eye Much before the emergence of Dalit leaders like Kanshi Ram and his prot├йg├йe, Mayawati, in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Ram Vilas Paswan was elected an MLA in 1969. After emerging as a powerful leader during the Emergency, he went on to register a Guinness World Record by winning the election from Hajipur with a margin of 4.24 lakh votes, the highest margin for any politician in the world at the time, in 1977. The sense of reverence that Paswan evoked in the community is captured by a slogan coined for him тАФ тАЬUpar Aasman, Neeche Paswan (the sky above, Paswan on the ground)тАЭ. Be it the leaderтАЩs own charisma or the absence of another tall leader from the community, the Paswan vote followed whichever coalition Ram Vilas Paswan chose to be with тАФ making the Paswans a readymade vote bank for his allies. Through his five-decade career, Paswan hopped from one political alliance to another, and aligned with parties of all ideological hues to remain in power. Over the years, he came to be known as тАЬmausam vigyanikтАЭ or тАЬweather scientistтАЭ, an acknowledgment of his propensity to always side with the alliance that would win. This often led to allegations that Paswan was betraying his ideological principles. But it was not an accusation that hassled him. тАЬWhether that Dalit is in politics or not doesnтАЩt matter. What matters is whether he or she survives for themselves and for the larger society. Things that one would consider normal for other communities, like getting primary education, is a huge mountain for the Dalit in north India,тАЭ he once told a journalist. тАЬThat is why my MA and LLB were considered Herculean victories in Bihar and are still considered as significant achievements by Dalit communities here. In such a context, what is most important for a Dalit is whether he or she is able to do some good for the marginalised through what may seem to be inconsistent ideological orientations.тАЭ In his book, Rise of the Plebians, French Indologist Christophe Jaffrelot said that, after the 2005 February Bihar election, the representation of upper caste MLAs in the state rose by 4.9 per cent and reached its highest level since 1990. He attributed this phenomenon to the LJP. тАЬIndeed, despite his strong desire for clubbing together a Muslim-Dalit combination to take on RJD leader Laloo Prasad Yadav (sic), Ram Vilas Paswan nominated about 30 per cent upper castes as candidates, and Muslims and Dalits together accounted only for 20 per cent of the candidates. Therefore, the percentage of the upper castes reached 55.2 per cent of the LJP MLAs and none of its Muslim candidates had been elected,тАЭ he wrote. Senior journalist Nalin Verma, who co-authored Gopalganj to Raisina Road, a book about the life of Lalu Prasad, said Paswan did not make тАЬany bones about giving tickets to upper castes in large numbersтАЭ. тАЬThe Paswans are a formidable but small vote bank, so he needed to make alliancesтАжтАЭ he added. тАЬHe did not pit the Dalits against the upper castes, like, say, Kanshi Ram did in UPтАж You see, he was a politician, not an activist.тАЭ For these, and other reasons, Paswan was seen by many as the тАЬBrahmin among DalitsтАЭ. While Paswan, and the LJP, which he floated in 2000, were the undisputed choice for the Paswan community, he failed to emerge as a pan-India Dalit leader like Kanshi Ram and Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh. There were several reasons for this, say experts. First, the nature of his caste group. The Paswan community is a very small, localised Dalit group, said Rajesh Paswan, a professor of Hindi at Jawaharlal Nehru University. тАЬIt is not like the Chamars, who are found in every state and region of India with a different name,тАЭ he added. So, while Paswan shared a legal affiliation with all the Scheduled Castes, it did not necessarily translate into a cultural affiliation, thereby limiting his acceptability as a pan-India Dalit leader. Second, as the dominant SC community, the Dusadhs have the maximum representation, both politically and in government jobs. This, like in the case of OBCs, where the Yadavs are believed to corner the bulk of reservation benefits, led to resentment among other SCs, who felt that the benefits of political empowerment were being concentrated in the hands of the Paswans, analysts told ThePrint. Nitish Kumar would go on to tap into this resentment, and create the category of Mahadalits in 2008 with the stated claim of ensuring a more equitable distribution of reservation benefits among the SCs. Paswan, whose community was classified as Mahadalit in 2018 when he and Nitish were allies under the NDA, saw the reservation as a bid to divide the Dalit community. Even now, ahead of the 2020 polls, Chirag Paswan has cited Nitish KumarтАЩs decision to тАЬbreak the unity of DalitsтАЭ as one of the foremost reasons for walking out of the NDA. тАЬIt worked both ways,тАЭ said Sanjay Paswan. тАЬThe Mahadalit decision cost Paswan the votes of other Dalits, but consolidated the Paswan vote in his favour even more.тАЭ With Ram Vilas Paswan no more, the political significance of this community is set to be tested in the upcoming polls. Narayan said, in the wake of PaswanтАЩs death, there is a possibility that the upcoming polls will witness a divide in the communityтАЩs vote. A split in the Paswan vote, if it happens, will be a first, and could cost the community its political dominance of decades.

A thandora in Ulagam village of Krishnagiri district announced that the 29 Schedule Caste families in the village will be ostracised. The announcement also said that helping them will attract a penalty of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. From October 1, the day the announcement was made, the Dalit families are forced to go to the nearby village even to fetch water and buy other essentials. Even the pathway used to reach the nearby villages has been closed. All this because a Dalit man married a woman from the Most Backward Classes (MBC) community, following which a first level investigation has started in a case filed by the Dalits against the caste Hindus under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Two years ago, Surya Kumar from the Adi Dravidar caste, a Scheduled Caste community, from Ulagam eloped with a 17-year-old girl belonging to the Kurumbas, an MBC community, from Maniyangal village. Speaking to TNM, Sethu, a resident of Ulagam, said, ├в┬А┬ЬThe family members immediately registered an abduction case with the police. However, six months later, the girl├в┬А┬Щs family agreed to get the couple married and also withdrew the police complaint. The couple formally got married since the girl turned a major and then settled in another village.├в┬А┬Э However, the oppression came through the Kurumbas of Ulagam village, who started attacking the Dalits. ├в┬А┬ЬThe MBC people attacked us by pelting stones and injured the men and women of the village. They also threatened the couple with murder. They wanted to unleash another caste killing to stop the villagers from intercaste marriages,├в┬А┬Э said Sethu. The Dalits soon gave a complaint to the police against the atrocities committed against them, after which the police registered a case under the SC/ST Act. However, even while the preliminary investigation was going on, the MBC people allegedly kept harassing the Dalits. ├в┬А┬ЬThey kept harassing us and tried to interfere with our daily work. We├в┬А┬Щre only 29 families while there are 300 Kurumba families, so we tried to avoid them. However, the oppression and ostracism reached a peak on October 1 with the thandora announcement as soon as we reached the village after a hearing,├в┬А┬Э said Sethu. Sethu added that the Kurumbas wanted them to withdraw the case under the SC/ST Act but they did not agree. ├в┬А┬ЬThat is the reason why we are ostracised. They said you should stay away from the village (odhuki vechitom) and started to deny us even essentials.├в┬А┬Э ├в┬А┬ЬThe residents are following the order and have stopped giving us essentials. If we go near their shop, they tell us to leave since they can├в┬А┬Щt afford to pay Rs 5,000 as fine. The caste Hindus have also cut the water connection to our homes. Our families don├в┬А┬Щt even have milk to feed the children,├в┬А┬Э said Sethu. He added that the police warned the caste Hindus on Tuesday night, and the consequences will be known only later.

The next morning, Kishore's family got to know that a fire had broken out in the liquor shop. Congress-ruled state of Rajasthan has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Several incidents of rapes and gangrapes have been reported in the the state in this month alone. And now, reports of another gut-wrenching incident are coming from Alwar district of the state, where a Dalit salesman was burnt alive by a liquor contractor. According to reports, a salesman working in a liquor shop in Kumpur village had asked for his salary due for five months. After the salesman demanded his salary, the liquor contractor allegedly poured petrol on him and burnt him alive in a deep freezer. SHO Dara Singh told that a report has been filed in Khairthal police station by victimтАЩs brother Roop Singh Dhanka who is a resident of Jhadka. Roop Singh told the police that his brother Kamal Kishore used to work with liquor contractors Rakesh Yadav and Subhashchand. The liquor shop was being run in a container at Kumpur-Bhagori turn. Singh alleged that his brother was assaulted and threatened whenever he demanded his salary. As told by Roop Singh, in the evening on October 24, Rakesh Yadavand Subhashchand came to KishoreтАЩs house and took him with them. When Kishore did not return in the night, his family thought that he might have gone somewhere with the contractors. The next morning, KishoreтАЩs family got to know that a fire had broken out in the liquor shop. VictimтАЩs family members reached at the site and opened the container in which the liquor shop was being run in the presence of the police. On opening the container, they found KishoreтАЩs charred body placed in sitting position in the deep freezer. Roop Singh has accused Rakesh Yadav and Subashchand of burning his brother alive after pouring petrol on him and then setting the container on fire. A case has been registered against Rakesh Yadav and Subhashchand under sections 302,436,120B of the Indian Penal Code and under the relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act. Enraged by the horrific incident, the locals have raised questioned as to why the liquor shop was being run inside a container. The family of the victim refused to send the body for postmortem demanding judicial inquiry in the case. On assurance from DSP Tarachand, the body was allowed to be sent for postmortem. Both the accused are absconding. The state president of BJP in Rajasthan, Dr. Satish Poonia posted a tweet condemning the incident. Likening Rajasthan with Somalia in Africa, Poonia said that there was no law and order in the state like the African country. рдХрд░реМрд▓реА рдЬрд┐рд▓реЗ рдореЗрдВ рдкреБрдЬрд╛рд░реА рдХреЛ рдЬрд┐рдВрджрд╛ рдЬрд▓рд╛рдиреЗ рдХреА рдШрдЯрдирд╛ рдХреЗ рдмрд╛рдж тАЬрдЕрд▓рд╡рд░;рд╕реЗрд▓реНрд╕рдореИрди рдиреЗ рд╕реИрд▓рд░реА рдорд╛рдВрдЧреА рддреЛ..рдЬрд┐рдВрджрд╛ рдЬрд▓рд╛рдпрд╛тАЭ рдкрдврд╝рдХрд░ рдРрд╕рд╛ рд▓рдЧрддрд╛ рд╣реИ рдХрд┐ рд╣рдо рдЕрдлреНрд░реАрдХрд╛ рдХреЗ рд╕реЛрдорд╛рд▓рд┐рдпрд╛ рдЬреИрд╕реЗ рджреЗрд╢ рдореЗрдВ рд░рд╣ рд░рд╣реЗ рд╣реИрдВ,рдЬрд╣рд╛рдВ рдХрд╛рдиреВрди рдирд╛рдо рдХреА рдХреЛрдИ рд╡реНрдпрд╡рд╕реНрдерд╛ рдирд╣реАрдВ рд╣реИ, рдХреНрдпрд╛ рдЧреГрд╣рдордВрддреНрд░реА рдЧрд╣рд▓реЛрдд рдХреЛ рдЕрдкрдиреЗ рдкрдж рдкрд░ рд░рд╣рдиреЗ рдХрд╛ рд╣рдХ рд╣реИ?#CrimeCapitalRajasthan pic.twitter.com/BR0AyETvbt Earlier this month, a temple priest Babulal Vaishnav was burnt alive by some people for preventing them for encroaching the temple land.

Police have said the victim knew one of the rape accused, who called her to come out of the house on some pretext. The incident took place at the girlтАЩs village in Vidisha of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday around 10 pm. All the three accused have been nabbed, including the minor. ""The victim went to meet the man outside her house from where she was dragged and taken to an isolated place in the village. The accused was then joined by two other men from the same village and the three took turns to rape her,"" police said. ""The accused even clicked pictures and made a video of the gangrape that was shared by them on several groups the next day.

In yet another shocking incident in Khammam district of Telangana, a minor Dalit girl was burnt by the same community man after he tried to rape her and she resisted, according to officials on Tuesday. The accused was taken into custody on Tuesday more than two weeks after the incident took place. The incident took place on September 18 but it came to light recently. On Monday night, when the local police was informed, they took immediate action of shifting the 13-year-old to Hyderabad's Osmania Government General Hospital with 70 per cent burns.  The 13-year-old minor girl hailing from Pallagudem, near Khammam town, was working as domestic help in the household of a 28-year-old married man named Maraiah who resides in Mustafa Nagar in Khammam town. Both belong to Budiga Jangam, a sub-caste in Dalit community. On September 18, when the victim was doing some domestic work, the accused attempted rape but when the girl raised alarm, the accused poured petrol and set her on fire. At that time only Maraiah's father was at home who rushed to douse the fire but the girl suffered burns all over the body. Maraiah's wife is pregnant and has gone to her parents home for delivery.  Accused Maraiah took the girl to a private hospital in Khammam town where she was being treated since September 18. Though the girl suffered nearly 70 per cent burns, the private hospital did not think it as medico-legal case and did not report it to the police. What happened from September 18 till October 5: It is still not clear why the minor girl's parents did not complain to police on September 18 itself or in next few days. According to some sources in the community, the accused tried to hush up the matter as ""accidental fire'' by saying the victim caught fire as she was trying to light a diya and promised to take care of treatment in the private hospital and pleaded with them not to tell anyone.  However, after 17 days, the ghastly issue came out and as soon as the local police got the news, they swung into action and first the minor girl was immediately shifted to Hyderabad's Osmania Government General Hospital where her condition is serious. Live TV  ""As soon as we got to know about this incident we shifted the minor girl to Hyderabad's Osmania Hospital, taken her statement, taken her parents' statement and booked a case against the accused under sections 376 r/w 511, 307, 354, 506 of IPC and section 10 of POSCO act. We have also nabbed the accused and will be producing him before the magistrate,'' Khammam Assistant Commissioner of Police, Anjaneyulu, told Zee Media. The police is also awaiting a report from District Medical & Health Officer ( DHMO ) to book a case against the private hospital where the victim was being treated from September 18. ""We have asked the DHMO to give a report on this hospital after inquiry and we are also consulting our legal team on how to proceed against this private hospital.

How Hathras horror may change Bihar election narrative","Jump to navigation Speak Now In 1977, several Dalits had been killed by upper-caste landowners in Bihar's Belchi village. Out of power, Indira Gandhi sensed a political moment. She travelled by train, jeep and tractor before settling for an elephant ride to negotiate muddy and water-logged tracks amid heavy rain. Her address to the community proved to be a game changer. On Thursday (October 1), more than four decades later, her grandchildren, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi, were taken into preventive custody by the Uttar Pradesh Police when the two Congress leaders tried to visit a village in Hathras district that has lost a Dalit girl to the savagery of four upper-caste men. While Rahul fell on the ground and grabbed headlines, his sister, a day later, attended a prayer meeting at Delhi's Valmiki Mandir and said every woman of the country must question the government and seek justice for the daughter of Hathras. The 19-year-old victim belonged to the Valmiki community. These are different times, dominated by social media and various other new factors. It's unfair to compare the Gandhi siblings with their grandmother. Hathras isn't in Bihar. But Bihar, UP's neighbouring state, has its Assembly election coming up in October-November. And the Opposition has been on a constant lookout for its political moment since 2014 when Narendra Modi stormed the Dilli Darbar. THE PROTESTS AND OUTRAGE The death of the Hathras girl on September 29, about a fortnight after she was allegedly gang-raped and brutalised in her village, has triggered nationwide outrage and protests. If the crime was shocking, the handling of the case has given ammunition to the political Opposition to target the Yogi Adityanth-led BJP government in the state. Despite the heinous nature of the crime, there was an inexplicable delay in registering an FIR. After she succumbed to her injuries, cops hurriedly and forcibly burnt the body in an open field in the dead of the night after locking the family members inside their village home. Then the police cited post-mortem and forensic reports to claim no semen was found in samples, and denied the gang rape charge. This disregarded the rape definition and ignored the girl's dying declaration in which she had said four men raped and brutalised her. Cops also barricaded the entire village and issued prohibitory orders to block media coverage. They also pushed, shoved and detained senior politicians, also including TMC's Derek O'Brien, who wanted to meet the victim's family. The District Magistrate was also seen pressuring the victim's family members into ""not changing their statements."" HOW HATHRAS CAN IMPACT BIHAR ELECTION The impact may not be on the outcome but it will certainly change the poll narrative. The gruesome crime in Hathras can dent the image of the ruling NDA (comprising Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU and the BJP) in Bihar where Dalits account for around 17 per cent of total voters. Protests against the Hathras incident have already started in Bihar. NK Choudhary, a senior social and political analyst from Patna, told India Today, ""The Hathras issue will certainly have some impact on the Bihar election. It may dent the NDA's image and puncture its claims of good governance and government with a difference."" Hathras may bolster the charge of the Opposition's Mahagathbandhan (comprising Tejashwi Yadav's RJD, the Congress and the Left parties) that the BJP is anti-Dalit, anti-women and pro-upper castes. Remember, women have played a key role in Nitish Kumar's election victories. He has announced a number of doles for the crucial voting bloc. ""Unlike in UP, there is no mass mobilisation of Dalits in Bihar. They are fragmented in blocs led by Chirag Paswan of the LJP, Jitan Ram Manjhi of the HAM (Secular), Ashok Choudhary of the Congress and Shyam Rajak of the RJD. But the election narrative may change,"" NK Choudhary said.""Issues of Dalits and women's safety may be raised by the Opposition more vociferously. Parties may consider giving more seats to Dalit candidates. NDA constituents Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi may have more bargaining powers in seat sharing,"" he, however, added. The NDA may announce its seat-sharing arrangement anytime. BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister and senior party leader Amit Shah held a meeting with Chirag Paswan over the issue on Thursday (October 1). Chirag Paswan has already criticised Nitish Kumar over various issues and has indicated his LJP will fight on 143 seats (out of the total 243) if it does not get a good deal. The return of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, another Dalit leader like Chirag Paswan, to the NDA fold has made matters more complicated. The LJP said its future course will be decided at its parliamentary board meeting at 5 pm on Saturday (October 3). The Mahagathbandhan has finalised seat sharing arrangements. The RJD is likely to give 70 seats to the Congress and 30 to the Left parties. ""What happened in Hathras is inexplicable because such incidents have political fallouts. It was in the interest of the BJP-led UP government to handle the case well,"" NK Choudhary said. Chirag Paswan has spoken to Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and asked him to take stringent action in the Hathras case. Udit Raj, national chairperson, All India Confederation of SC/ST Organisation, told India Today from Patna that Hathras is a sensitive issue and it has affected people in poll-bound Bihar. ""It's an election factor. The delay in registering an FIR, the hurried burning of the body and the mishandling of political protests will have a negative impact on the BJP, and the JDU will also bear the brunt. Privatisation was anyway a big issue for Dalits in Bihar,"" said the former BJP MP who is now a Congress spokesperson. But DM Diwakar, former director, AN Sinha Institute of Social Study (Patna), told India Today, that parties in Bihar are interested only in sharing power. ""Nobody is bothered about Dalit emancipation. Dalits would have gotten justice, had there been land reforms and housing for them had the recommendations of various commissions been implemented."" ""They are at the bottom when it comes to literacy, education, health and nutrition because only lip-service has been done. Every political party has a Dalit morcha. But the BJP and others exploit Dalits as Hindu votes. They want Dalit faces, and not Dalit leaders,"" DM Diwakar said. ""There is no doubt that areas which have seen Dalit movements have seen change. But after 1991, also when the Left movement weakened, the situation got worse. Under the influence of liberalisation, public policy became anti-poor. Since Dalits have the largest share among the poor, they are the most affected. When you kill PSUs, there are no jobs or reservation anyway. The Ram temple movement came to counter the Mandal push."" The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced dates for Bihar Election 2020. All 243 seats in the state will go to the polls in three phases (October 28, November 3 and 7). November 10 will be the results day. It will be interesting to see how much Belchi gains netas are able to extract from Hathras.

The woman's mother said she was abducted in the morning while on way to secure a college admission, as reported by ndtv.com. When she failed to return in time, the family launched a search for the woman. The family says she returned around 7 pm, and that the assailants had allegedly put her on an e-rickshaw and sent her home, sources said. ""The men had injected her with some substance due to which she lost consciousness. Then they raped her... They broke her legs, they broke her back. A rickshaw-wallah brought her home. They was thrown in front of our house. My child could barely stand or speak,"" the woman's mother said, weeping. ""Somehow, crying, my daughter said, 'Save me, I do not want to die',"" the mother said. She added that soon after her return, her daughter complained of a burning pain in her stomach. ""The doctor at the local hospital said her condition is serious and advised that she be taken to Lucknow. But she died when we were near Balrampur town,"" she added. The girl looked dazed and had an intravascular cannula, medically known as Vigo and used for administering injection or other fluids in the body, inserted in her hands, said Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma. About the reports that the victim's legs and back were broken, he said, ""It was not confirmed in the post-mortem. We contradict this news."" The victim was cremated on Wednesday after the post-mortem in the presence of her family members, the police said. The district magistrate and the SP, along with the mahant of the Devipatan temple, Mithilesh Nath Yogi, visited the victim's house on Thursday morning, met the family members and condoled her death. ""The family members were assured that the accused will be given a strict punishment in accordance with law. A letter sanctioning a financial assistance of Rs 6,18,450 was handed over to them by the mahant. The amount will be sent to the victim's mother bank account by the afternoon,"" a statement issued here said. The mother has demanded a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a government job for her son. ""My daughter wanted to become a lawyer but she was killed. The same fate should await the culprits. We want justice. My son should be given a government job and we should get at least Rs 25 lakh as compensation,"" she said. The ""jungle raj"" that has spread in Uttar Pradesh has no limits and the time for accountability is now, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, adding that a gruesome incident like Hathras had taken place in Balrampur too. ""Law and order is not run by marketing and speeches. This is time for accountability of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. The public wants accountability,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. Alleging that ""atrocities"" on women and the government's brazenness is continuing, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said, ""Did not give respect when alive and also snatched the dignity in death."" His tweet, also in Hindi, referenced the Hathras victim's family being allegedly denied the right to properly perform her last rites. When the matter was reported to the police from the hospital, the parents alleged that their daughter was gang-raped, SP Verma added. Acting on the parent's complaint, police identified the accused as Shahid and Sahil and arrested them, the SP said. Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said, ""After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gang-raped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition. Condolences!"" ""The BJP government should commit no laxity in this case as was done in Hathras and arrest the accused immediately,"" he added with a hashtag #Balrampur... #NoMoreBJP"" on his Twitter handle. The Balrampur case comes at a time when there is a widespread outrage over the gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Hathras. A 19-year-old Dalit was allegedly sexually assaulted by four upper caste men on September 14 and referred on Monday to the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi with spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She died around 3 am on Tuesday.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

A Dalit woman claimed that she had been gang-raped by 3 men on Tuesday at a village in Ajmer. The woman, who is married, approached the police on Wednesday and lodged a complaint. On September 29, the woman had gone to meet her mother as the latter was sick. The woman was on her way to Daurai village when a man identified as Teepu approached her. Teepu allegedly dragged the woman to a nearby field and raped her. After raping the woman, Teepu called two of his friends to the spot who allegedly raped her. The three men held the married Dalit woman hostage for hours and dropped her on a nearby road before fleeing from the spot. The aggrieved woman went to her mother's home where she narrated her ordeal, The Times of India reported. Following this, the woman went to the police station with her mother and lodged a case. The police launched a probe into the case and sent the woman for a medical examination.

The BJP hit out at Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday for their ""selective outrage"" in cases of atrocities against women as it questioned their ""silence"" over the alleged rape and killing of a six-year-old girl in Punjab. Noting that the young girl belonged to a Dalit migrant family from Bihar, Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman also took a swipe at Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, questioning if he had asked Rahul Gandhi about the issue while holding a joint poll campaign with him in the state.  Attacking Yadav, she referred to a news report of 2008 to talk about the ""allegations of eve-teasing and misbehaviour with women against the RJD brothers"", a reference to him and his elder brother Tej Pratap. ""It (the Punjab incident) may not hurt the RJD because that is how things were when they were in power,"" Sitharaman told reporters while flaying Lalu Prasad Yadav's party for the ""jungle raj"" during its rule in Bihar during 1990-2005.  Hitting out at the Congress, she said, ""The pretentious Congress has not said a word. The tweet-friendly Rahul Gandhi has not tweeted on the Hoshiarpur incident. There has been no outrage. And no picnic either."" Her ""picnic"" jibe was in reference to Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi's visit to Hathras in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh following the alleged gangrape of a Dalit girl, who died in a Delhi hospital subsequently. The BJP had accused Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of practising ""political tourism"".  ""The Congress party should stand up and answer. Does this kind of selective outrage suit the stature of their party? ""Why is the brother-sister pair not going and voicing horror in Hoshiarpur? Why not in Rajasthan? The selective cry of outrage that the Congress wants to show when it is elsewhere but not in states governed by it is completely exposed,"" Sitharaman said. Stating that crimes like rape should not be politicised, she said certain political parties are selective in voicing horror.  Another senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar also slammed the two Congress leaders and asked why had they not paid a visit to the family of the victim in Punjab yet. He accused Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of going on a ""political tour"" to Hathras, as he questioned the lack of a similar reaction from the two leaders to ghastly crimes against women in Punjab and Rajasthan, which are ruled by the Congress.  They go to these places for ""photo-op"", Javadekar said, referring to the Congress leaders' visit to Hathras. ""A six-year-old girl coming from a Dalit migrant family from Bihar was raped and murdered in Punjab's Tanda. Former Union minister Vijay Sampla from our party met the family. Nobody from the Congress met them.  ""They (the Gandhis) cannot see atrocities against women in the states where it (Congress) is in power. Neither Rahul Gandhi nor Priyanka went there and nor was there any comment from its president, Sonia Gandhi,"" he told reporters here. Javadekar also claimed that the culprits in the rape-and-murder case in Punjab have not been arrested yet and demanded stringent action against them.  In a horrifying incident, a six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire, with her half-burnt body found at a home in Tanda's Jalalpur village, police said on Thursday. The accused тАФ Gurpreet Singh and his grandfather Surjit Singh тАФ have been arrested on the charges of murder, rape and under other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, they said.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA
"763",6793,"https://www.thenewleam.com/2020/10/from-acid-attacks-to-drinking-urine-what-upper-caste-india-makes-its-dalits-undergo/","From Acid Attacks to Drinking Urine, What Upper Caste India Makes its Dalits Undergo","Days after the Hathras incident, two new episodes of gross injustice and violence highlight the pathetic plight of IndiaтАЩs Dalit community. An environment of violence and gross injustice against the members of the Dalit community seems to be growing in India, with reports of rampant abuse of human rights, perpetration of violence, exploitation and crimes, intolerance against the community seems to have become an everyday occurrence. The Hathras gang-rape incident that captured the national imagination over the last couple of weeks is but an example of the wider culture of systematic injustice and violence being perpetrated on members of the community and much before the nation could recover from the pain and trauma of the incident, two new cases of sheer inhumanity and violation of dignity practised towards the community have again come to light. These incidents highlight and underline for us, the fact that India continues to be a country characterised by systematic violence and injustice against the Dalits, and an inadequate socio-political infrastructure that preserves the dignity and wellbeing of the community seems to have been reduced into a distant dream. The Brutal Rape and Murder of Dalit Woman in BiharтАЩs Buxar A Dalit woman was brutally raped and tortured in BiharтАЩs Buxar district by a gang of men. The atrocities didnтАЩt limit itself here, the womanтАЩs two children were also beaten up and thrown into a nearby canal and reports predict that their death is certain. The woman has been receiving treatment at a local hospital. The anguished and deeply traumatised woman is repeatedly asking for a glimpse of her children but their bodies have not been recovered so far.While some of the accused have been arrested, some still continue to be on the run. This incident has come to light at a time when there is growing outrage and disillusionment among people in the aftermath of the brutal rape and murder of a Dalit woman in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Hathras. Dalit Girls Attacked With Acid in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Gonda District The first incident is being reported from Uttar PradeshтАЩs Gonda district. Here three Dalit sisters, all of whom were minors, were thrown acid at while they were sleeping inside their home. The three sisters were attacked with acid and the eldest sister(17 years) has 35% burn injures, while the second eldest sister(12 years) has 25% burn injuries and the youngest sister( eight years)has suffered 5% burn injuries. After the attack the girls were rushed to a nearby hospital and are presently undergoing treatment for their burn injuries. The incident took place in the early hours of the morning as the three girls were fast asleep on the terrace of their home. The family has also registered an FIR against unknown persons in this regard. SP Shailesh Pandey issued a statement and said, тАЬEarly morning we received information that three girls sleeping in the house were attacked by some chemical and we are trying to identify the chemical. We have sent the girls to a government hospital and they are in a better condition. The hospital has made all arrangements for their treatment. The eldest girl has received the maximum burn injury. We have talked to the family members of the girls and they do not have any suspicion on anyone so far. Police teams have been formed and both the forensic teams and dog squads have already investigated the crime spot. We will soon find those responsible.тАЭ The family members of the Dalit girls who have been attacked said that in the early hours of the morning all the three girls screamed in pain and came downstairs crying. The family initially confused that the burn injuries were from a gas cylinder blast but later found out that the injuries had been caused through an acid attack. The family also informed that they had recently fixed the marriage of the eldest daughter, who has just passed out of school. But they also feel that the attacker must be from the same locality, although they have not expressed suspicion on anyone so far. Elderly Dalit Man in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Lalitpur Made to Consume Urine The next case of violence being perpetrated against the members of the Dalit community in India, again has been reported from the Lalitpur district of Uttar Pradesh. Here an elderly Dalit man was brutally tortured and assaulted and compelled to drink urine. The incident unfolded in the Roda village. According to preliminary reports, the accused in the matter, had recently attacked the son of the Dalit man with an axe and after that the father-son duo had approached the police. The Dalit man alleges that the accused has ever since been trying to compel them to withdraw the compliant and settle the matter. The Dalit man was forced to drink urine and when he refused, he was beaten and thrashed brutally by the accused. Nurturing a Socio-Political Environment Hostile to the Dalit Voice The environment of continued violence, indignity and sheer injustice against the members of the Dalit community seems to have become a commonplace affair in India and everyday we come across instances wherein Dalit women are being raped, people are being burnt alive or being brutally assaulted, Dalit children being denied access to educational opportunities and entitlements and Dalits facing discrimination in all forms. No wonder we have become a country where every 15 minutes, a crime is committed against a Dalit. Everyday in India, on an average, six Dalit women are raped and over 56,000 Dalit children living in the most impoverished conditions in Indian slums die of malnutrition every year. It would not be wrong to say that the evil of casteism has continued to plague the Indian societal fabric even after seven decades of independence and this, despite a series of legislations that make crimes against Dalits punishable offences. Dalits are raped, beaten, assaulted and murdered everyday and their stories are seldom the central concern of mainstream media. It is ironic that with inadequate reporting and representation in mainstream news coverage, the privileged and ignorant elite often believe that the malaise of caste has disappeared from India, but when one looks for the stories, there are many many more than can be counted on the fingertips. There is no denying to the fact that the political and economic vulnerabilities of the Dalit community and their sustained social marginalisation have robbed them of their ability to challenge systemic injustice and raise a voice of powerful dissent, let alone take action against people who snatch away their human rights. The growing atrocities against the Dalit community in India and the stark political silence, bring us all to a moment of collective shame. While turning a blind eye to this cancerous malaise will not eradicate the problem from the society, what we also have to understand is that we must continually ask why Dalit lives have stopped to matter in India and for how long we as a society, will tolerate violence and discrimination against our country-people?

S. Rajeswari, president of the Therkuthittai panchayat in the Cuddalore district, was made to sit on the floor during a meeting, the pictures of which have gone viral. тАЬThis is the norm here. I have never been allowed to sit on a chair during our meetings. There were four meetings in our village panchayat since January after I was elected the president. But the panchayat vice president has never allowed me to sit on a chair, as all the chairs will be reserved for the people from the dominant caste here. They think I should be under them even if I am an elected representative,тАЭ Rajeswari told THE WEEK. Rajeswari hails from the SC community in Therkuthittai, where the dominant Vanniyar community is the majority. The vice president of the panchayat, Mohanrajan, who has been absconding after Rajeswari filed a complaint, belongs to Vanniyar community. A case under sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act has been filed against Mohanrajan and panchayat secretary Sindhuja, who is also absconding. The district administration spoke to Rajeswari and her husband Saravana Kumar after photos of Rajeswari sitting on the floor during a meeting, that happened on July 17, went vial. Therkuthittai is dominated by Vanniyars and there is also a considerable SC and ST population, Rajeswari said. The village houses 500 vanniyar families and at least 100 SC/ST families. тАЬWe have registered a case and the investigation is on. The district administration will definitely take action against the person responsible for this act,тАЭ Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri told the media. During the investigation, Rajeswari informed the district administration that she was being humiliated during every meeting and was not allowed to hoist the flag during the Independence Day celebration. V. Amurtham, president of Athupakkam panchayat in Thiruvallur district, was also not allowed to hoist the national flag. When the issue flared up in the media, Amurtham was made to hoist the flag five days after August 15, with the help of the Thiruvallur district administration. ЁЯУг The Week is now on Telegram.

"766",6806,"https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2020/10/the-ghosts-of-caste-still-haunts-india/","How Are Dalit Women Treated In India?","ItтАЩs been 7 decades of independence, yet India has been unable to destroy the caste system. In India, sexual violence is an ordinary event. When it comes to violence on the basis of caste, it becomes more common. The ghost of an evil caste system is still part of our society. No political party has tried to end this caste system. Politicians are also confining Dalits to the vote. When I heard that a Dalit woman had been raped, I was shocked. But many people started asking why are you seeing caste in this? Every time news of caste-based violence makes it to mainstream media, so-called upper caste media professionals automatically blame and pronounce that caste cannot have played a role. Caste is a living reality in India. The National Crime Records Bureau (2019) reports that 10 Dalit women are raped every day in our country. These figures are those whose reports were recorded, but the real figures are many more than this and tell a terrible picture. UP saw a 25 percent increase in crimes against Dalits between 2015 and 2016. In the Hathras case, the mainstream media showed it, but why does it not seem necessary until something terrible happens. Will you tell us that any work is done in our society without seeing caste? We also get married by looking at caste and vote by seeing caste. When I spoke to Damini kain, who is doing her Masters in Political Science at Delhi University, and also hails from Western Uttar Pradesh, about the violence that women face due to caste, She said that тАЬWhen it comes to crimes against the Dalit community, we are evasive to the extent of being oppressive.тАЭ She also says that the nexus of upper-caste dominance, even in the Hathras case, is a reflection of how Dalit women are treated, even by lawmakers. I talked to Jolene who is studying Women, Culture and Development, and she said that the same hierarchical structure is present in Dalit politics. She also pointed out that women are left out from the political structure. The structure of Dalit politics is very exclusionary and alienated for women who come from a marginalized community. She added that women from subaltern communities face oppression on the basis of caste, class and gender. Dalit men should welcome women from the subaltern community. She also pointed out that Kanshiram and Ambedkar believed in the movement led by women. All parties will crash if they donтАЩt welcome women. The rise in sexual crimes and barbaric atrocities isnтАЩt fueled by caste dynamics alone. The Dalit women who have the least amount of social and legal protection are an easy target. When I say that not one, but many factories are behind this crime, by this I mean that rape is seen as a weapon for avenging animosity. I myself come from the so-called high caste, and I have to say with shame, that the manner in which the voice of Dalit women is being suppressed is so wrong. I was brought up in a family where Ambedkar was abused because he had given reservation to Dalits. I come from a so-called privileged family where Dalit issues are not even discussed. There is no talk about caste oppression and there is separate pride about caste. There is a particular thought process behind rape; the idea that тАЬwe are powerful and you are weak.тАЭ When this happens to a Dalit woman, they want to say that the dignity of a girl coming from the so-called low caste is even more vulnerable. What can we do to annihilate caste? Can inter-caste marriages destroy caste? If we want to destroy caste, we have to teach children about caste from childhood. Children have to be made aware of caste. Inter-caste marriage is also good because we understand our partnerтАЩs struggle. When I married inter-caste, I understood the struggle and got a chance to read about Ambedkar well. In school also, teachers have to be made aware of caste and the upper caste children will have to be explained about reservation and what it is necessary for.

In India, sexual violence is an ordinary event. According to 2019 NCRB data, a woman is raped every 16 minutes in India. That means 88 women in a dayтАж32,033 women in a year. But only a few such incidents are accorded тАШnews valueтАЩ. The Indian media could justify not covering all rapes with the famous journalistic adage of тАЬdog bites manтАЭ not being news. Judged by that logic, one could sayтАФwithout a tinge of humourтАФthat rape in India is indeed as common as dog bites (50,000 a year). There are strong socio-cultural reasons for why the Indian media sensationalises a few rape cases and lets go of many others with a near-conspiratorial silence. If one may be blunt, the first response kicks in if the victim is from a dominant caste, urban, educated and fair. If itтАЩs a rural woman, from an oppressed caste and dark, the news adorns itself with silence. Aligned to HinduismтАЩs centuries-old concept of touchables/untouchables, it seems rape and its severity can be categorised depending on... If you are not a subscriber ?

The police in Uttar Pradesh said a dismembered body of a 15-year-old Dalit girl was found in a maize field in KanpurтАЩs Dehat district on Saturday, PTI reported. The police suspect that the girl, who was missing for a week, was killed over a property dispute. Superintendent of Police of Kanpur Dehat Keshav Kumar Choudhary claimed the girl was abducted and killed by her uncles, ruling out the possibility of rape. Choudhary said they have arrested two of the girlтАЩs uncles, 65-year-old Brij Lal and 60-year-old Jiya Lal. They have allegedly confessed to killing her over a property dispute. The teenagerтАЩs father had accused them of murdering his daughter over the land dispute, according to Hindustan Times. The police officer said local residents found the girlтАЩs body 500 metres away from her native Gaholia Rura village. Her body was partially eaten, possibly by wild animals, he added. Choudhary said the body of the girl has been sent for autopsy and they were waiting for the results to ascertain the exact cause of her death. Meanwhile, the police said a four-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her relative under the limits of Khair police station in Aligarh. Superintendent of Police of Aligarh Rural Shubham Patel said the girl was admitted to a hospital and her condition was stable. The incidents came amid nationwide outrage over the gangrape and murder of a 20-year-old woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. Opposition leaders have highlighted several other violent incidents in the state in recent days, including allegations of a similar gangrape of a Dalit woman in Balrampur district of Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Congress Chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said there was тАЬlawlessnessтАЭ in the state after he was placed under house-arrest. Ninety-two former civil servants have also written to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, expressing concern at the тАЬbrazen violation of the rule of lawтАЭ in the state in connection with the Hathras gangrape case. тАЬJust when we thought that nothing could numb our consciences and brains further, the handling of the Hathras incident by the Uttar Pradesh administration has shown that, as a nation, we are plumbing the depths of depravity and callousness in governance,тАЭ their statement said. However, Adityanath had on Friday asserted that his government was committed to the safety of women. тАЬThose who even think of harming mothers and daughters in Uttar Pradesh, their destruction is assured,тАЭ the chief minister said in a tweet. тАЬThey will get such punishment that will set an example for the future. The government of Uttar Pradesh is committed to the safety and security and development of all mothers and sisters. This is our commitment and promise.тАЭ","IND","dalit",1,1,NA,NA

In 2020, if we are still having to establish the pervasive nature of caste within our social structures, then our progress as a people is debatable. To the savarna eye, caste may not exist; it is the Dalits (which literally means oppressed or broken) who have felt the sting of this societal and systemic oppression in their bones for thousands of years, and has now translated into what could be referred as the intergenerational Dalit trauma. The Dalit trauma, oppression and discrimination experienced by members of the community have been multidimensional тАУ from brutal physical, emotional, psychological and sexual abuse to everyday microaggressions, leaving a haunting imprint on the psyches of the people. The Dalit trauma, oppression and discrimination experienced by members of the community have been multidimensional тАУ from brutal physical, emotional, psychological and sexual abuse to everyday microaggressions, leaving a haunting imprint on the psyches of the people. The sheer volume of abuse and suffering inflicted upon this community due to an organised system of societal stratification at the hands of the тАШupperтАЩ caste individuals has been indiscriminately huge. Privilege allows one to be caste blind, but to deny the suffering and pain of a community that is a perpetual victim of alienation, denigration, discrimination and violence is to shirk away the responsibility of being a part of this society. Also read: Caste Impunity Vs Legal Protection For The Hathras Rape Victim Dalit trauma does not fit into the classical definition of trauma, which is defined as the emotional and physical response to a highly distressing event. For the Dalit community, life has been a series of traumatic events of varying degrees, forcing them to live in perpetual survival mode. The nature of Dalit trauma is intergenerational тАУ passed on from one generation to the next, forever altering their psychological, emotional and physical states. Intergenerational trauma begins with the first generation that is directly impacted by threatening circumstances and suffers post-traumatic stress. It is then passed on to the future generations through secondary traumatisation, experienced in the form of emotional dysregulation, chronic anxiety and high stress levels, intra-community violence, unhealthy attachment styles, and higher levels of physical and mental illnesses. According to psycho-historian Peter Loewenberg, unconfronted grief or unmanaged trauma is a kind of neuronal тАЬshort circuitтАЭ, in that it changes the DNA in a way that unconsciously binds the descendants of a traumatised community in collective and unconscious solidarity with the original trauma. In his work Cultural Trauma and Collective Identity, Jeffery C. Alexander writes тАЬcollective, cultural trauma occurs when a group of people feel that the trauma they have endured leaves indelible marks upon their group consciousness, marking their memories forever and changing their future identity in fundamental and irrevocable ways.тАЭ Dalit experience has been fraught with physical, mental, financial and social insecurity; the unfulfillment of these primal needs has triggered a constant sense of anxiety and a strong need for security in the minds of Dalits. Starting with the idea of pollution attached to their identity, Dalit minds were trained to feel a profound sense of shame about who they were and the work they were assigned. This is тАЬlearned cultural shameтАЭ and it is an intrinsic quality of the contemporary Dalit identity. Their bodies and their lives didnтАЩt seem to matter, and have been consistently used as a battleground to establish and perpetuate Brahmanical hegemony and power structures dictated by the Hindu caste system. Religion and faith, which constitute a psychological refuge for many, betrayed the Dalit community by pushing them to the literal margins of the society and legitimising the oppression they experienced throughout their lives. Their voices, their expression, their art have been underrepresented and erased from the face of history, diminishing their identity to the confines of victimhood. The discrimination faced by Dalits isnтАЩt just caste-based; dimensions like religion, nation, gender, and class play a role in determining the form and degree of discrimination. The intersection of caste and gender is where we get to witness the ugliest facet of caste-based discrimination. The caste system advances by controlling women; by asserting ownership and control over a Dalit womanтАЩs body and reducing it to a tool to maintain power dynamic, savarna men continue to harass and rape Dalit women with impunity. There is no element of lust in this act, it is caste-based gender violence, a statement that serves as a testimony for the uncontested superiority of savarna men and to show Dalits тАШtheir placeтАЩ. According to Ranajit GuhaтАЩs definition of a subaltern, Dalit women are impacted by three levels of subordination; тАЬher sex, her poverty, and her casteтАЭ. Not only are they subjected to violence by upper caste men, they also suffer abuse at home from their own husbands. The sexual exploitation faced by Dalit women isnтАЩt a feminist issue alone; the element of caste makes it much more intense, degrading and dehumanising. The societal expectation of subservience defines a Dalit womanтАЩs trauma, with her health and wellbeing often compromised and not given enough importance, and the public ownership of her sexuality. One of the tenets of the caste system is the colonisation of knowledge; Dalits have been deprived of access to knowledge and resources, ancestral wealth and financial security. In 1950, the reservation system and caste-based quotas were established to provide representation to historically and currently disadvantaged groups in Indian society in education, employment and politics. While it helped advance the quality of lives for many Dalit families, it was marked by an undercurrent of resentment and protest from the upper caste population. Even though they havenтАЩt had the access to a robust social network and resources which is the case for many savarnas, Dalits have harboured an intrinsic sense of shame around their position in these institutions as a тАЬquota candidateтАЭ and often suffer discrimination even in professional environments. The fact remains, even at a premier college and studying amongst the most meritorious crowd of the country, the Dalit student feels small and hesitant to assert her presence in the classroom. To reveal their identity and to тАШcome out as a DalitтАЩ can put their lives at risk at any given time. Today, there is a wider class gap among Dalits because of better access to education and employment. While a major section of the population still struggles to preserve their integrity on an everyday basis and is susceptible to harassment in all shapes and forms, there exists the upper echelon within the Dalit community that is privileged enough to pronounce themselves as equal to a savarna family of similar economic status. However, that is rarely the case though; caste is a psychological burden for Dalits, so much so that it alters the way they view life. The Dalit trauma that they have inherited and individually endured often results in a low sense of self-esteem, psychological and physical insecurity, a sense of shame and guilt merely for existing, inferiority complex, emotional dysregulation and inability to forge healthy relationships. The Dalit trauma that many have inherited and individually endured often results in a low sense of self-esteem, psychological and physical insecurity, a sense of shame and guilt merely for existing, inferiority complex, emotional dysregulation and inability to forge healthy relationships. A challenging consequence of intergenerational trauma is the individual not being able to recognise it themselves; this is because the transferred psychological and behavioural patterns are normalised within families. The inability to communicate in relationships and poor coping mechanisms may become normal. The importance of acknowledging and decoding Dalit trauma is paramount. The issue of caste is complex; understanding this aspect of caste allows us get a deeper insight into what it means to be Dalit. The mental health of marginalised communities, be it the LGBTQIA+ community, the Adivasis or Dalits has an additional layer of societal stigmatization and oppression to deconstruct, and in order to level the grounds for everyone, we need to comprehend the unique experiences these communities go through. Also read: Dalit Women Will Get Justice Only If Casteist Judicial System Is Uprooted If a Dalit individual decides to avail therapy, it is essential that the therapist understands Dalit trauma, even if and especially, in case they belong to an upper caste. We need to address the scathing issues that slap us in the face every day, the crimes and atrocities against Dalits and the systemic treatment of them, but we also need to engage in conversations that are not just limited to visible damage caused by caste apartheid. We need to understand caste privilege and call out even the subtler forms of discrimination, within our social circles. We need more inter-caste marriages and relationships. We need exposure to Dalit literature, art, and history. тАШThe broken peopleтАЩ are not supposed to be broken anymore, the responsibility lies in the hands of everyone тАУ Dalits and more importantly, non-Dalits, especially those who are in the position to educate themselves and further the narrative so that we can begin to dream of an anti-caste India. тАШAn Exploration Of Four Dalit Narratives As Trauma LiteratureтАЩ by Upaasana Suresh Featured Image Source: Upliftconnect.com Priyanka is an unfulfilled engineer and an MBA graduate from IIM Indore.

Educate, Agitate, Organize Author тАУ Dr. Raj Kumar Hans Growing out of the powerful, anticaste sant tradition of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in northern India, the Sikh variant of Guru Nanak (1469тАУ1539) and his successors evolved into an organized religious movement in Punjab in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It became a rallying cry for the untouchables and members of тАЬlower castesтАЭ that they be allowed a respectable social existence. As a young, vibrant religion of the subcontinent, the Sikh religion has witnessed high and low points in its journey of five hundred years. So have the Dalits of Punjab, who joined it in great numbers in the seventeenth century and found dignity and equality within its egalitarian fold. But in the process of its growth and expansion in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth, its body politic came to be afflicted by casteism and untouchability from which the great gurus had tried to extricate its followers. Being a religion of the book from within the Indian tradition, Sikhism has received worldwide scholarly attention in the last hundred years. Whether due to the strong doctrinal position of egalitarian Sikhism or the hegemony of the dominant Jatt Sikh caste, whose members have also been the focus of academic work, the issues of caste and untouchability within SikhismтАЩs history have received scant attention. The remarkable contribution of Dalits to the Sikh tradition has been missing from the mainstream Sikh discourse. Naranjan Arifi, a nonprofessional Dalit Sikh historian writing in the Punjabi vernacular, laments the discriminatory attitude of Sikh historians. тАЬIf the Sikh historians had honestly and impartially recorded history from the point of view of history writing,тАЭ he writes, тАЬtodayтАЩs general readers would not have been confused on several issues.тАЭ Arifi is convinced that тАЬSikh history needs to be rewritten from the start without bringing in miracles and magic so as to give a scientific and analytical orientation to history.тАЭ(Naranjan Arifi, Ranghrehtian da Itihas (Adi kal ton 1850 tak), Part I, Amritsar: Literature House, 1993, 13) This article first deals with the great attraction of Sikhism for DalitsтАФthat is, its egalitarianism. Second, it covers the forgotten facets of DalitsтАФtheir glorious moments, their heroes, and their achievementsтАФwithin the Sikh tradition. Last, it discusses the emergence of the Hindu caste system, particularly the practice of untouchability, within the Sikh tradition and the setbacks and resultant sufferings of Dalit Sikhs. The conversion of large numbers of Dalits to Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and Sikhism amounts to a search for equality and human dignity that had been anathema to Hinduism. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar believed that bourgeois nationalism, republicanism, and traditional Marxism did not provide any satisfactory solution to the problem of caste and untouchability. He, therefore, turned to religion for sustained relief. Before Ambedkar turned to Buddhism, he had considered the option of embracing Sikhism along with his followers, thereby opening the same path for Dalits of the subcontinent. Being a notable intellectual of twentieth-century India, he carefully weighed the implications of such a move in contrast to turning to other non-Hindu religions. He was aware of the strong anti-Brahmanical principles and practices of Sikh religion. Following a тАЬpedagogicalтАЭ device for Sikhism, the very word тАЬSikhтАЭ denotes the relationship between the guru (teacher) and the Sikh (pupil). And the whole Sikh movement was the proximity of thinker-people, an organic relationship between the gurus and their followers. At the pinnacle of Sikh thought, the merger of the two (aape gur chela) achieves a radical position within the Indian tradition. J. P. S. Uberoi puts it aptly in the case of the last guru, Gobind Singh (1666тАУ1708): тАШThe tenth guru of the Sikhs . . . became in effect the disciple of his disciples at the new revolutionary moment of reversal, inversion and reflection of the leader/follower relation.тАЭ (J. P. S. Uberoi, Religion, Civil Society and the State: A study of Sikhism, Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1996, 74)The pedagogy of liberation epitomized in Guru Granth Sahib also turns out to be тАЬmagisterialтАЭ in the sense that it resists all systems of oppression and injustice, especially perpetrated on the poor. As it speaks in the name of the low, the poor, the oppressed, the text envelops the philosophy of liberation. It does this so completely that Guru Nanak, coming from the upper caste of Khatris, identifies completely with the lowest of the Indian social order, Dalits: I am the lowest of the low castes; low, absolutely low; I am with the lowest in companionship, not with the so-called high. Blessing of god is where the lowly are cared for. The Sikh guru embraced untouchables by distinctly aligning himself with them to challenge the Hindu caste system. He destroyed the Hindu hierarchical systemsтАФsocial as well as political. The subversion of the system reached its climax in the creation of Khalsa by the tenth guru, Gobind Singh, in 1699. The real historical force emerged out of the long gestation of the liberation praxis and philosophy that not only fully integrated the untouchables into the struggle for liberation but also succeeded in abolishing the inhuman practice of untouchability in the Sikh practice. It is another thing that untouchability was to re-enter the body politic of the Sikh religion in the mid-eighteenth century and fully corrupt it in the nineteenth century. By practicing what they preached, the gurus became the exemplars of their message. Guru Nanak felt that the real cause of the misery of the people was the disunity born of caste prejudices. To do away with caste differences and discords, he laid the foundation of sangat (congregation) and pangat (collective dining). Thus, all ten of the gurus took the necessary steps to eliminate the differences of varna and caste. No special places were reserved for people of high rank or caste. The pangat institution, in particular, was encouraged and strengthened by Guru Amar Das. He insisted that everyone partake of simple food when coming for sat sangat (holy congregation). We get direct testimony from Bhai Jaita (c.1657тАУ1704), a legendary Dalit Sikh, in his epic poem Sri Gur Katha, which was composed after the Khalsa formation and before his death in 1704. Bhai Jaita was rechristened as Jiwan Singh, after the creation of тАЬKhalsa,тАЭ a new identity of Sikhs conferred by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. He says that Guru Gobind SinghтАЩs Sikhs do not recognise baran (varna) and jaat (caste) distinctions but considers only good deeds as good baran. Now listen to the rahit of the Singhs, The Singh should pray to God keeping the war in mind. When a victim and a needy person beseeches help; Forgetting his own, a Singh should remove othersтАЩ suffering. Not keeping in mind differences of high and low caste, The Singh should consider all humans as children of God. Abandoning the Brahmanical rituals and customs, The Singh should seek liberation by following the gurusтАЩ ideas. (Giani Nishan Singh Gandiwind, Shaeed Baba Jiwan Singh: Jeevan, Rachna te Viakhia, Amritsar: Bhai Chatar Singh Jeevan Singh, 2008, 181) As most literature on Sikh history and religion has failed to take account of the Dalits, John WebsterтАЩs pioneering formulation on the тАЬDalit history approachтАЭ is quite instructive. According to him, тАЬthe Dalit history approach is based on two assumptions. The first is that of Dalit agency. In this case, Dalit Sikhs move to centre-stage to become the chief actors and shapers of their own history; the historian will therefore focus upon them, their views, their struggles, and their actions. The second is that a conflict model of society, with caste as not the only but the most important contradiction in Indian society, provides the most appropriate paradigm or understanding their history.тАЭ(John C. B. Webster, тАЬThe Dalit Sikhs: A History?тАЭ in Tony Ballantyne, ed., Textures of the Sikh Past: New Historical Perspectives, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007,132-154.) There is no work on Sikh history and tradition in English that has been produced from the Dalit history perspective. Major historical works reflect what Webster calls the тАЬSikh history approach.тАЭ Only a few books available in Punjabi (Gurumukhi) languageтАФnot all of which are by professional historiansтАФcan be seen as written from the тАЬDalit Sikh approach.тАЭ While denouncing the established histories as nothing but high-caste histories, S. L. Virdi stresses the need for a Dalit history: тАЬIndia needs such a history that germinates revolutionary consciousness for social change because history plays a very significant role in this respect. Society assumes a character and shape as moulded by its history. From this perspective, Dalit history has a very important role. тАШDalit historyтАЩ is another name for тАШrevolutionтАЩ in Indian society.тАЭ(S. L. Virdi, Punjab da Dalit Itihas (1901 ton 2000), Phagwara: Dalit Sahit Academy, Punjab, 2000, xxxi-ii) While Shamsher Singh Ashok wrote his history of the MazhabisтАФcommissioned by K. S. Neiyyer, a Dalit Sikh settled in LondonтАФNaranjan Arifi, a Dalit officer in the revenue department of the Punjab government, wrote a bulky volume on the history of Dalit Sikhs after a great deal of research. He gives us a comprehensive account of Ranghretas or Mazhabis joining the Sikh fold as early as the period of the fifth guru, Arjun (1563-1606). Arifi very diligently extracts Dalit information from the Sikh writings available since the early eighteenth century. In this volume he provides fascinating details about Ranghretas up till the mid-nineteenth century, giving them the names and voices and highlighting their individual and collective participation in the growth of the Khalsa.(Shamsher Singh Ashok, Mazhbi Sikhan da Itihas, Amritsar, 2nd revised ed. 2001) The fact that a large number of Dalits, seeking liberation from discrimination and degradation, had joined and secured respectable status within the Sikh order was exemplified by the gurusтАЩ special relations with some of the Dalit families. One notable Dalit family was that of Bhai Jaita. His great-grandfather, Bhai Kaliana of Kathunangal Village, near Amritsar, is said to have converted to Sikhism during AkbarтАЩs time. Intimate ties of his family to the gurus motivated Jaita to carry the severed head of Guru Teg Bahadur under the most violent circumstances from Delhi to Anandpur in 1675. Overwhelmed with emotions, the young Gobind Singh, the tenth guru (1666тАУ1708), had embraced Bhai Jaita with this blessing: тАЬRanghrete guru ke beteтАЭ (The untouchables are the GuruтАЩs own sons). Jaita emerged as a fearless Sikh warrior who so endeared himself to the tenth guru that he was proclaimed by the guru as the panjwan sahibjada (fifth son), in addition to the guruтАЩs own four sons. It is at the time of the creation of the Khalsa in 1699 that Bhai Jaita was rechristened as Jeevan Singh. He was killed in a fierce battle with Mughal armies in 1704 at Chamkaur. Bhai Jaita remained neglected to such an extent that it was hardly known to let alone acknowledged that he was also a scholar poet. He had composed a long poem, Sri Gur Katha, mentioned above, that provides an eyewitness account of important events surrounding Guru Gobind Singh. It is only with the recent emergence of Dalit Sikh scholarship that a body of literature has begun to be built up around Bhai Jaita in attempts to recover Dalit Sikh pasts. The way Bhai Jaita had been integrated not only into Sikh religion but also into the family of Guru Gobind Singh makes it understandable that any other identity would have been meaningless to him. His identity as a Ranghreta had been subsumed by his identity as a Sikh, as he says: тАЬO Jaita, the savior guru has saved the Ranghretas. The pure guru has adopted Ranghretas as his sons.тАЭ The numbers of Dalits who became Sikhs can be gauged from their presence in Guru Gobind SinghтАЩs army. Arifi gives interesting details about some leading Dalit warriors, and some of them were also among Guru Gobind SinghтАЩs fifty-two court poets. The notable among them were Kavi Dhanna Singh Ghai, Aalam Singh, Dhakkar Singh, Dharam Singh, Garja Singh, Man Singh, and Nigahi Singh. By the mid-eighteenth century, whenтАФamid sustained persecutions by the MughalsтАФthe Sikhs organized themselves into five dals (warrior bands), one of these was composed entirely of Mazhabis or Ranghretas under the command of Bir Singh Ranghreta, who had raised a force of 1,300 troopers. After the death of Guru Gobind Singh, Banda Bahadur (1670тАУ1716), whom the guru had sent from Maharashtra to save the Sikhs from the Mughal oppression in Punjab, succeeded in mobilizing Sikhs to fight against Mughal governors. Muhammad Shafi Warid, the contemporary Persian writer talks of the levelling effects of Banda BahadurтАЩs policies after the victory of Sirhind: тАЬAfter the slaying of Wazir Khan, Banda Bahadur laid down that of Hindus and Muslims, whoever enrolled among his Sikhs, should be one body and take their meal together so that the distinction in honour between the lowly and the well-born was entirely removed and all achieved mutual unison, acting together. A sweeper of spittle sat with a raja of great status, and they felt no hostility to each other. . . . If a lowly sweeper or cobbler (chamar), more impure than whom there is no caste (qaum) in Hindustan, went to attend on that rebel [Banda], he would be appointed to govern his own town and would return with an order (sanad) of office of government in his hand.тАЭ(тАЬBanda Bahadur and his Followers from Muhammad Shafi тАЬWaridтАЭ, Mirat-i-WaridatтАЭ, translated by Irfan Habib in Grewal & Habib, Sikh History from Persian Sources, New Delhi: Tulika, 2001, 161-62) The trend continued throughout the eighteenth century, as noted above. The strength of Dalits in the Sikh Panth and Ranjit SinghтАЩs army was considerable. We have an account of the Sikhs in Ghulam Ali KhanтАЩs history of the eighteenth-century north Indian state of Awadh, written in 1808. He says: тАЬFinally, now [1808 ad] the whole country of Punjab up to the At-tock River [Indus] and this side up to Multan, and from the banks of Sutlej to Karnal . . . is in the possession of this sect. Their leaders of high dignity are mostly from the lower classes, such as carpenters, shoemakers and Jats. In addition to the army, which they call dal, the number of Sikhs in Punjab has reached millions, since yogurt-sellers, confectioners, fodder-vendors, grain-sellers, barbers, washermen, all [fully] keep their hair and, saying Wahi Guru di fateh, interdine with each other. They are not confined to Punjab only. In the whole of Hindustan from Shahjahanabad [Delhi] to Calcutta, Haidarabad and Chennapatan [Chennai], groups after groups are found to belong to this sect; but most of them are market people (bazarian), and only a few are well-born.тАЭ (тАЬAn account of the Sikhs, 1808 from Ghulam Ali Khan, Imadus SaadatтАЭ translated by Irfan Habib in Grewal & Habib, op.cit., 214-15) Creativity, especially literary creativity, is another area in which the Sikh religion seems to have played a significantly positive role in the life of Dalits. Reference has already been made to Bhai JaitaтАЩs Sri Gur Katha (Story of Sikh gurus), an epic composed at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The second Dalit poet was Sant Wazir Singh (c. 1790тАУ1859) who prolifically composed metaphysical and social poetry, both in Punjabi and Braj Bhasha. He attracted a number of people as his followers, including five poet disciples hailing from high castes. One of the five poets was Nurang Devi, who was the first female Punjabi poet groomed under sant Wazir SinghтАЩs tutorship. The next Dalit intellectual writer Giani Ditt Singh (1852тАУ1901) emerged as a poet, teacher, polemicist, journalist, orator, and ardent Sikh missionary, who turned out to be the pillar of the Singh Sabha movement. Sadhu Daya Singh Arif (1894тАУ1946) who came to master the Gurmukhi, Urdu, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages was the most popular intellectual poet of his time in Punjab. His first poetical work, Fanah-dar-Makan (Doorstep to dissolution), was published when he had just turned twenty. The work which made him a household name throughout Punjab was Zindagi Bilas (Discourse on life), which was completed in 1916. All of them have remained neglected in the histories of Punjabi literature. From the early twentieth century, a series of Dalit writers are writing with clear Dalit consciousness.(For a broad survey of dalit see Raj Kumar Hans, тАЬRich Heritage of Punjabi Dalit Literature and its Exclusion from HistoriesтАЭ, Beyond Borders: The SAARC Journal, vol. 6 No. 1-2, 2010, 73-81) Caste and untouchability came to afflict the Sikhs, particularly in the past two centuries. There was a gradual rise of Sanatan Sikhism, a fine admixture of Hindu caste-centric practices and Sikhism, in the second half of the eighteenth century. By the close of the nineteenth century, it had assumed a vicious form. Features of Sanatan Sikhism were first outlined in a genealogical history of Sikh gurus by Kesar Singh Chhibber in Bansavalinama Dasan Patshahian ka, completed in 1769. Chhibber belonged to a Brahman family of Jammu. He attributes the Guru Gobind SinghтАЩs power and success to the worship of a Hindu goddess and gives considerable importance to the role of Brahmans in his account of the Sikh gurus. Arifi devotes more than a hundred pages of his book to a close examination of ChhibberтАЩs work and lashes out at him, saying that the work is тАЬa complete conspiracy against the gurusтАЩ philosophy as its purpose is to introduce Brahmanical ideas. Historian J. S. Grewal is also highly critical of ChhibberтАЩs work and calls it тАЬBrahmanizing the traditionтАЭ: тАЬWhether consciously or unconsciously, Kesar Singh Chhibber makes a consistent and an earnest attempt at Brahmanizing the Khalsa tradition.тАЭ(J.S. Grewal, тАЬBrahmanizing the Tradition: ChhibberтАЩs BansavalinamaтАЭ in The Khalsa: Sikh and Non-Sikh Perspectives, New Delhi: Manohar, 2004, 85-86) It is ironic that the Hindu caste-centric practices entered Sikhism during the reign of Ranjit Singh (1780тАУ1839), who founded the first Sikh empire in India. Henry Steinbach, a European soldier in Ranjit SinghтАЩs army, made an astute observation: тАЬThe assumption of irresponsible power by Ranjeet Singh destroyed, in some degree, the potency of the Khalsa.тАЭ (The Punjaub: Being a brief Account of the Country of the Sikhs, Karachi: OUP, 1976 (originally published in 1846, London), 159)That the Hindu practices were fast creeping into Sikh culture during Ranjit SinghтАЩs time was also observed by another European traveler in 1836, Baron Charles Hugel, who noted that тАЬlike every other religion grounded in deism, the faith of the Sikhs is already deteriorated; image worship and distinction of castes are gradually taking place of the precepts enjoined by their original institutions.тАЭ(Travels in Kashmir and Panjab containing a Particular Account of the Government and Character of the Sikhs, tr. from German by Major T. B. Jervis, 1845, London, 283) The Golden Temple at Amritsar has been the sanctum sanctorum for Sikhs, as Mecca is for Muslims, and had assumed such an importance in the religious and political life of Punjab. Ranjit Singh abolished the system of collective management and assumed the right to appoint a temple manager. This precedent was used by a subsequent ruler of Punjab, Lieutenant-Governor Sir Robert Egerton, in 1881 to appoint his own temple manager and by that time, the Mahants had already introduced non-Sikh practices in the precincts of the temple Idols were placed in the Golden Temple, and Dalits were prevented from bathing in the sarovar (holy tank). The deterioration in the Sikh religion was observed at the beginning of the twentieth century by John Campbell Oman, a keen student of Indian epics, mysticism, cults, customs, and related issues. During his extensive visits to the Golden Temple Oman noticed quite a few Hindu practices within the complex. In front of the Akal Bunga, goats were slaughtered on the Dussera festival. He found that along the northern side of the pool, a Brahman was worshipping tiny images of Ganesh and Krishna. At the northeast corner of the tank, there was a Shiva temple with a lingam, and along the eastern side there was another temple of devi (goddess). At the devi temple Oman тАЬencountered Brahmans engaged in worship, separately, of course. One had before him a saligram and a picture of the temple of Badrinath; while the other adored a saligram and a tulsi (holy basil) plant. The latter worshipper appeared quite at home in the precincts of the Sikh temple, for he blew sundry loud blasts by means of a conch, from which he managed to produce some three or four distinct notes.тАЭ(John Campbell Oman, Cults, Customs and Superstitions of India, 1908, 95-98) Caste prejudice and the practice of untouchability being central to Hinduism, any individual, organization, or ideology questioning it was always seen as an enemy, and no effort was spared to eliminate the challenge. In the context of the Sikh religion, A. E. Barstow observed in the 1920s that тАЬHinduism, [due] to its wonderfully assimilative character, had thus reabsorbed a good part of Sikhism, as it had absorbed Buddhism before it, notwithstanding that much of these religions is opposed to caste and the supremacy of the Brahmans.тАЭ (The Sikhs, 1928, p. 19)Bhagat Lakshman Singh (1863тАУ1944), a scholar and intellectual who was a new convert to Sikhism, believed that the Sikh creed had been Hinduized after the establishment of the Sikh rule. (Autobiography, 192.)Khushwant Singh is straightforward in admitting that тАЬSikhism did not succeed in breaking the caste system. . . . and Sikhs of higher castes refused to eat with untouchable Sikhs and in villages separate wells were provided for them.тАЭ(The Sikhs, 45-46.) The Sikh leadership by that time had gotten so lost in the struggle to liberate gurdwaras from the clutches of Brahmanized Mahants that the agenda to liberate Sikh minds from casteism was set aside. The helpless situation drove Bhai Pratap Singh, the head granthi (priest) of the Golden Temple, to write a treatise on the issue. Besides looking into the theological and practical high points against untouchability in the Sikh tradition, he summarized the efforts of the SGPC for the removal of untouchability between 1921 and 1933.(Bhai Pratap Singh, Jaat Paat te Chhut-Chhaat sambandhi Gurmat Sidhant, Amritsar: SGPC, 1933.) AmbedkarтАЩs engagement with Sikhism was another factor contributing to the introspection on the part of a small group of Sikh reformers seeking to remove untouchability. It started with AmbedkarтАЩs powerful move in 1936 to envisage a dignified life for the Dalits in the Sikh religion. An editorial in Khalsa Sewak on March 7, 1936, reports that Ambedkar had written letters to the SGPC but laments that the committeeтАЩs response was unsatisfactory. The editorial notes with sarcasm that with all this тАЬthe Sikhs are so indifferent that they would not stop bragging of their reforms on paper, which is just a show, but in practice not a single step forward has been taken.тАЭ Sikhism emerged as a vital religious force and movement with ideas of equality and liberation for the downtrodden. It succeeded in empowering those groups of Punjabi Dalits who joined it. They excelled in several fields, including religion, warfare, and literary creativity. The nonreligious path to emancipation was a socialist revolution. The Communists have had a few successful movements in Punjab since the 1920s but only once addressed the Dalit question explicitly. The exception was the young revolutionary Bhagat Singh, who wrote a lengthy article titled тАЬAchhut da SawalтАЭ (The question of untouchability) in 1928. Pointing at the competition between different religions to win the untouchables to their respective folds out of sheer political greed and vested interests, he issued a clarion call to Dalits to unite and fight their own battles, as no one else would fight for them. (This article was published in the June 1928 issue of Kirti under the pen-name of тАШVidrohiтАЩ. See Jagmohan Singh, ed., Shahid Bhagat Singh ate uhna de Sathian dian Likhtan, Ludhiana: Chetna Parkashan, 221) But after Bhagat Singh was martyred in 1931, no Communists followed his approach. Dalits in general and Dalit Sikhs, in particular, find themselves at a crossroad as far as the question of religion is concerned. A group of Dalit Sikhs whose families have retained memories of the glorious past are unable to understand what has happened to the religion, and they still entertain hopes that Sikhism will restore what has been lost. Yet a majority of Dalits have experienced the tensions of conflicting attitudes and feel frustrated as they turn away from Sikh religion. Education, political awareness, and Dalit assertion pose the challenge to older religious identities as Dalits find alternative ways to seek dignity and pride. (Excerpts from Rajkumar Hans тАЬMaking Sense of Dalit Sikh HistoryтАЭ in Dalit Studies, edited by Ramnarayan S. Rawat & K. Satyanarayana, Duke University Press: Durham & London, 2016, 131-51). Edited and compiled by тАУ Dr. Jas Simran Kehal, MA (Journalism), MS (Ortho). Thank you for this beautiful article Dr. Hans Ji! I think Sikhs have a great future because of historians like yourself and others mentioned in this article. This caste crap will come and go but Sikhi will remain. There will always be bad apples in any society or culture or faith who want to exert their control, power and ill will to chip away the good foundations. But there will be equally others who will make sure to not let that happen, keep repairing and strengthening those foundations by staying true to our Guru SahibaansтАЩ teachings.

BJP workers on Tuesday staged agitations across Tamil Nadu demanding that Thirumavalavan apologise for his remark. The VCK cadres countered it by flash protests and they allegedly attacked saffron party office-bearers at Madurai. Actor Khushbhu, who quit Congress and joined BJP earlier this month, was arrested by the Chengalpet police on Tuesday while on her way to Chidambaram to take part in a protest against Thol Thirumavalvan. The VCK leader has been booked by Chennai Police on Friday after a complaint by the BJP. He faces charges under various IPC sections relating to the outraging of religious feeling, the vilification of religion, causing alarm to the public and others. Thol.Thirumavalavan on Saturday participated in a protest held in Valluvar Kottam in Chennai and said, тАЬThe Manusmriti that divides humans and demeans women should be banned. On September 27, Periyarists in Europe conducted a webinar and I gave a 45 minutes speech. A few groups edited out five minutes from the forty minute video and claimed that I am demeaning women. The Hindutva groups are circulating the false message against me.тАЭ He added that leaders like Periyar, MC Raja and Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. Now a century later, VCK is reiterating the demand to ban Manusmriti. Explaining his words, Thirumavalavan said that he was not demeaning women and requested women from all segments to listen to the entire speech. He also thanked тАШdemocratic forcesтАЩ and parties who extended support for the protest. VCKтАЩs allies including the DMK and Congress have supported Thirumavalavan. In a statement, DMK president MK Stalin said, тАЬThirumavalavan spoke citing Sanatana-Varnashrama-Manusmriti texts that demean women. This is the outcome of the awareness created by Thanthai Periyar and AmbedkarтАж It is condemnable that police instead of taking action against the communal groups that has twisted the statement of Thirumavalavan took action against the VCK leader himself.тАЭ Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani also extended his support to ThirumavalavanтАЩs appeal to ban the Manusmriti.

The Kayathar Police arrested seven persons belonging to the Thevar community for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to fall at their feet after one of his baby goats mixed with their herd. Paulraj, a 55-year-old from Olaikulam town in Thoothukudi district, approached the police after the accused recorded the incident and shared it on social media channels. Though the said incident happened on October 8, the incident came out in the open only after a video of it went viral on social media, as per a local media report. The SP, Thoothukudi Jeyakumar said, тАЬThe incident took place on October 8. We received a complaint from Paulraj on October 11 and immediately booked seven members under eight sections of the SC/ST act. They were all arrested on Monday.тАЭ In his complaint, Paulraj has accused 60-year-old Sivasangu of forcing him to fall at his feet after a heated argument over the baby goat. Sivasangu, police said, also sought help of his family members Sankilipandi (19), Udayammal (33), Periyamari (47), Veeraiah (42), Mahendran (20), and Maharajan (24) to humiliate Paulraj. The two had reportedly clashed a few months ago after one of SivasanguтАЩs goats went missing and he suspected Paulraj of stealing it.

It was Thol Thirumavalavan, a Member of Parliament and the Chief of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), who had shared a 10-second video on social media to highlight that caste-based atrocities are not specific to north India but happen in Tamil Nadu also. After the video went viral, the victim was identified as 60-year-old Paulraj, from a village in Kayathar taluk in Thoothukudi district. He has around 100 goats and sheep and herds them for a living. On the day of the incident, one of his goats allegedly ran into the herd of Sangili Thevar, one of the accused in the case, which angered Sangili Thevar. He called Paulraj names and insulted him using caste names, to which Paulraj allegedly retorted. An angry Sangili Thevar went into the village and brought his relatives Periyamari, Mahendran, Maharajan, Udayammal and Veeraiya.

News18 A woman Dalit panchayat president in the district was allegedly humiliated by the vice president, who did not allow her to sit on a chair at meetings or hoist the national flag, drawing widespread condemnation from political parties. Police are on the lookout for the vice president Mohan Raj, while suspended panchayat secretary Sinduja and a ward member R Sugumar have been arrested, a senior police official told PTI, adding the latter has been held for offences including intimidation. The alleged disgraceful event that led to an outrage, came to light after a photograph of S Rajeswari, president of Therku Thittaivillage under Mel Buvanagiri Panchayat Union sitting on the floor at a meeting and others on chairs went viral in the social media, prompting authorities to swing into action. Condemning discrimination, many social media users expressed outrage and sought swift action to ensure justice. District Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri and Police Superintendent M Sree Abhinav went to the village, located near the temple town of Chidambaram and held an enquiry on Saturday. The Police officer said Rajeswari named the panchayat vice president and secretary in her complaint and a case has been registered against the duo under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act for offences, including humiliation and for obstructing her official work. ""We will take a statement from her, investigate and appropriate action will be taken,"" Abhinav told reporters. To a question, he said there would be no threat to her life, adding adequate police personnel have been deployed in the village. ""Other ward members too have realised what has gone wrong,"" he said. The Collector said four meetings have been held in the panchayat office so far. The panchayat president Rajeswari was forced to sit on the floor while some ward members claimed that she did so voluntarily, the Collector said. ""The inquiry is going on, based on her complaint. Strict action as per law will be taken against those involved,"" he said, adding the photograph was clicked on 17 July, 2020, according to the date displayed on that image. A show cause notice has been issued to Mohan under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act's provision, governing removal of the vice president and appropriate action would be taken, he said. Rajeswari, when asked why she had not complained earlier, said she initially tolerated the vice president's behaviour, but decided to lodge a complaint now when his ill treatment intensified. Only the vice-president hoisted the national flag and she was not allowed to do so (during Independence Day and other events of significance), she alleged. Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said it was 'barbaric' and promised tough action as per law. The AIADMK government had all along given due respect and recognition for the marginalised people, including Scheduled Castes and Tribes, he said. MDMK general secretary Vaiko said such humiliation was outrageous, while DMK MP Kanimozhi said it was strongly condemnable and the leaders demanded tough action. Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi Thol Thirumavalavan demanded the immediate arrest of those involved for obstructing the official work of the panchayat president. Not only Theruku Thittai, the scenario was the same in several other villages, the VCK leader alleged and urged the government to review the situation and take appropriate remedial action. Meanwhile, cadres of VCK and Left outfits gathered in front of the Buvanagiri police station in the district, demanding the arrest of the vice president and secretary. The incident comes months after a woman Dalit panchayat president in Tiruvallur district was not allowed to unfurl the nationalflag on Independence Day. She did so later following the intervention of district authorities.

The Karnataka police on Friday arrested a 48-year-old farmer from Kudur in Ramanagara for allegedly killing his 18-year-old daughter for falling in love with a Dalit man. Eighteen-year-old Hemalatha's body was recovered in a mango grove in Magadi, about 60 km away from Bengaluru city, in a mango grove. The police said that Krishnappa, who is from the Vokkaliga community, a dominant caste, did not approve of his daughter's relationship with her boyfriend Puneet, who is from the Dalit community. On October 9, 48-year-old Krishnappa filed a missing persons complaint with the Kudur Police stating that his 18-year-old daughter Hemalatha, a first-year B.Com student, was missing. In his complaint, he alleged that he had gone to his farm to oversee some work and returned home at 4 pm to find that his daughter had gone missing. He had also said that a man named Puneet had been constantly calling his daughter for a few weeks. He had also indicated that he suspects Puneet's hand in her disappearance. The Kudur Police, who began the probe, picked up Puneet, a farm worker in Kudur, for questioning. Kudur Police said that after interrogating Puneet several times, they began to suspect foul play. ""Puneet told us that he and Hemalatha had been in love since she began going to college. He said that a few weeks ago, Krishnappa found out that Puneet and Hemalatha were in a relationship and wanted her to end it,"" Magadi Circle Inspector Manjunath told TNM. Puneet allegedly told the investigators that Krishnappa wanted Hemalatha to end the relationship. He also informed the police that Krishnappa told Hemalatha's cousins, Yogi (21) and a 17-year-old, to talk to Hemalatha and dissuade her from continuing the relationship. ├в┬А┬ЬWe just couldn't find anything suspicious about Puneet initially and his alibi was accurate too. There were witnesses who said he was working in the farm at the time of the disappearance. That's when we began suspecting Krishnappa,├в┬А┬Э the police said. On October 14, the police took Krishnappa into custody and questioned him as they suspected his hand in her disappearance. ├в┬А┬ЬHe kept changing his statement. He initially said he and his nephews killed her. He later said that he found her body when he dug up a pit to plant saplings in the mango grove. But, the interrogation of Yogi and the minor revealed that the three of them killed Hemalatha,"" Inspector Manjunath added. On October 15, the police picked up Yogi and interrogators with expertise in questioning juvenile suspects took the 17-year-old boy into custody. ""We learned that the three of them were involved in the murder,"" Inspector Manjunath said. Police said that on the evening of October 9, while Krishnappa was on the farm, Yogi and the minor boy allegedly got Hemalatha to the grove by telling her that her father was waiting for her. ""When they took her to the mango grove, Krishnappa and Hemalatha are believed to have had a fight. Based on Yogi's confession, we learned that Krishnappa told her that he would kill her. Yogi and the minor boy smashed a boulder on her head. Then the three men dug up a pit in the grove and buried her body,"" police added. The Kudur Police took Krishnappa to the spot where the body was buried and recovered the body on Friday. ""He is claiming that his nephews killed her and he later found the body when he dug up the pit to plant saplings. His testimony kept changing. Finally yesterday afternoon (Friday) he confessed to the crime. He said that his daughter's relationship with a Dalit man would have brought shame upon his family due to which he enlisted his nephews' help to kill her,"" Inspector Manjunath added. The Kudur Police registered an FIR under section 302 (murder), 120b (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code on Friday. ┬й2021 the news minute","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

He is a local doctor, who was first called to treat the victim by the two accused at a room behind a grocery store run by one of the accused in a nearby market. The doctor told reporters on Friday that one of the accused visited his clinic to take him to his house to treat the victim, introducing her as a family member at around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. The doctor said he became suspicious when he saw the victim lying alone on a sofa. ""I returned immediately, saying that I will treat her only in the presence of her family members and started asking for her father's name and contact number. The youths then told me that they would bring the victim to the clinic with her father for the treatment, but they did not do so. Later, I came to know that she had died,"" he said. The victim's mother had earlier alleged that some youths had abducted her while she was returning home from the college and taken her to a room where she was raped and brutalised. The incident occurred on Tuesday when the woman had gone to take admission in a college near her village but did not return home till late in the evening, said Superintendent of Police (SP) of Balrampur, Dev Ranjan Verma. The woman later returned on a rickshaw with a glucose drip inserted in her hand while the family members were searching for her. Verma said the family members stated that the woman's condition was not good, so they rushed her to a nearby hospital and later to the Balrampur district hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. The woman's family alleged that the woman's hands and legs were fractured but the police officials stated that no such injuries were confirmed in the post-mortem examination. The two accused were arrested after an FIR was registered following a complaint filed by the victim's brother. The accused were booked under sections 376-D and 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for gang-rape and murder respectively. District Magistrate Krishna Karunesh and Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma assured the family members that the case will be sent to a fast track court and the strictest action will be taken against the accused.

A division bench of Justices M M Sundresh, and D Krishnakumar also asked the petitioner to appear before the court on Friday. Swaminathan, the girlтАЩs father who works as a priest at a temple in Thiyagadurgam, 235 km from here in the newly formed Kallakurichi district, has alleged that Prabhu had married his daughter after kidnapping her. The bench directed Prabhu to produce his wife before the court when the matter came up for hearing on Thursday. The MLA, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste, married S Soundarya in a simple ceremony in the presence of his family members on Monday amid drama as the girlтАЩs father attempted to self-immolate outside the venue. The father also moved the High Court on the same day.

Since my parents objected to my relationship with Prabhu, I stormed out of my house and have now married him. The marriage took place with my consent and not because of any threat. I was neither abducted nor threatened,тАЭ the 19-year-old said in her message. A Prabhu, a first-time legislator, is 36 years old, while the girl is 19. Prabhu was close to SoundaryaтАЩs family for the past 10 years and had enjoyed a good rapport with them and that is how the couple came to know each other. The MLA said though he had known Soundarya for the past 10 years, their relationship began only a few months ago. тАЬThe girlтАЩs family did not accept our relationship, but the wedding took place with the consent of my family members.

A 20-year-old Dalit girl was raped and tortured by four upper caste men while she was working out in the fields. Two weeks after the attack, she died in a hospital in Delhi. The family was barred from attending her last rites. Instead of being allowed a funeral, the girlтАЩs body was burnt by the cops in the dead of the night. The act would have gone unnoticed and been covered up, had it not been for a few courageous journalists who recorded the burning as it happened. Later the same day, another such case emerged from Balrampur, also in Uttar Pradesh. The common factor here, apart from the sickening violence, was the victimsтАЩ caste. They were both Dalit. Why is this important to highlight? Because caste-based violence and discrimination is a horrible reality of India, even in the 21st century. I do not have the knowledge or the experience to talk about what Dalits go through in India. What I do know is that itтАЩs time to listen to the people who have been talking about the gaps in our legal system, the discrimination they face because of their caste, and why the feminist movement in India will always be incomplete if it doesnтАЩt take the effect of caste, gender and religion-based discrimination on women into account.

The three girls are sisters, and were asleep on the top floor of their home in the village of Paraspur when the attack took place at around 1.30am. The two younger girls, aged eight and 12, received minor injuries while the eldest, 17, suffered disfiguring wounds to her face. All three have been admitted to the local hospital for treatment. Police told The Independent that they are investigating the possibility that the attacker was known to the family. The Additional Superintendent of the Gonda district police, Mahendra Kumar, said they have four teams working on the case and await the statement of the girls to proceed with their investigation. While the family has alleged it was an acid attack, Kumar said the police are yet to identify which chemical was used in the attack and are carrying out a forensic examination. The father of the girls, Ram Avatar, said in a statement to the police and local media that he was sleeping on the verandah while the three girls were asleep on the roof of the house on Monday night. тАЬWhen my daughters screamed, I immediately opened the door and grabbed one of them. When my vest burned, I got to know that somebody had thrown acid at them,тАЭ he told a local TV news channel. The father said the family had no animosity with anyone else in the village, and he could not think why his daughters would be attacked. Uttar Pradesh state is already at the centre of national tensions surrounding the rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, a case which has dominated the news amid allegations of police mishandling the case and targeting protesters with arrest. The Dalit community is the lowest of the four major divisions in the Hindu caste system, and are included in a group known as Scheduled Castes who are provided additional protections in Indian law. They comprise about 16 per cent of the total Indian population according to the 2011 census. The community still battles discrimination in various forms and has long been at the receiving end of caste-based violence in India.

Not just the Dalit MPs, but Brahmins too have been alleging тАЬselective targetingтАЭ ever since the death of gangster Vikas Dubey in a police тАЬencounterтАЭ in July. The Brahmins were taken by surprise after the BJP picked Yogi as CM. Though a тАШmahantтАЩ of the Gorakhnath sect, they do not see Yogi as one of their own.

The claim further says the men later gang raped the officerтАЩs minor daughter inside the car. The caption in Malayalam along with the video translates to, тАЬIn Nagpur, RSS activists hack and stab a Dalit IAS officer to death. Horror scenes of his 16-year-old daughter being gang raped in the car.тАЭ India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. The video is of a gambling den kingpin being stabbed to death by rivals in MaharashtraтАЩs Nagpur city. The claim is viral on Facebook in Malayalam. The archived version can be seen here.

The video description says, тАЬKishor Binekar alias Balya, a suspected gambling den kingpin, was allegedly stabbed to death by five unidentified persons at a petrol pump signal. Police said Binekar, also having several offences against him, was followed by the assailants on bikes. His car was blocked by one of the assailants. Binekar was dragged out and stabbed outside the car in full public view. Here is the video!тАЭ We also found reports on the incident by тАЬThe Times of IndiaтАЭ and тАЬOutlookтАЭ, confirming that the victim was a gambling den kingpin. There are also reports on Nagpur Crime Branch arresting the accused in the case. However, there is no mention of gang rape in any of the report. For better clarity, we reached out to the office of Nagpur Zonal DCP Vanita Sahu. The office confirmed to us that the incident took place on September 26 and the man murdered was a gambling den kingpin. It also said there was no rape associated with the incident. AFWA also spoke to sub-inspector JN Rajput from Sitabuldi police station, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place. тАЬBoth the victim and accused have criminal backgrounds. Also, the victim was driving the car alone. There was no woman with him. The murderers entered the car in an attempt to hijack it. But they couldnтАЩt. All the accused have been arrested. More than 15 years back, Kishor had killed the father of the main accused, Chetan. The murder was an act of planned revenge by Chetan and his friends. Further investigation is on,тАЭ the officer said. Hence, it is clear that the man being stabbed to death in the viral video is not a Dalit IAS officer but a gambling den kingpin from Nagpur.

Photo: APrabhuOfficial/Facebook   Chennai, October 7 A Dalit AIADMK MLAтАЩs marriage to a 19-year-old Brahmin woman has met with staunch opposition from her father, who after a scuttled suicide attempt, alleged that the legislator abducted his daughter, a charge denied by both the bride and groom. When the MLA, A Prabhu, tied the knot with S Soundarya at his residence at Thiyagadurugam in Kallakurichi district on Monday, her father Swaminathan, a temple priest, dropped in, police said. He reportedly said he would тАЬgiftтАЭ the couple his тАЬlifeтАЭ and attempted to set himself ablaze after pouring petrol on his body. However, he was overpowered by police personnel and party workers. At the local police station, the priest was advised against taking extreme steps and asked to give an undertaking that he would not attempt to kill himself. The priest said his objection to the marriage was not the caste factor, but the difference in age between his daughter and the MLA. The legislator was 36-year-old and his daughter was 19 and a groom who was 17 years older than the bride would not be a suitable match, he said. Also, Swaminathan alleged that his daughter was abducted by the MLA and that she was тАЬlured and divertedтАЭ and made to marry Prabhu against her wishes. Soundarya, however, asserted that she married Prabhu out of her own volition, adding she was in love with the MLA for about four months. In a video post, in which she appeared alongside her husband, the MLA, a B Tech graduate, too dismissed the claim of the priest that his daughter was kidnapped. тАЬWe were in love for about four months and when I sought the permission of her parents to marry her they denied it,тАЭ the MLA said. Later, he said he married Soundarya only based on her wish and with her whole hearted consent. Swaminathan claimed that due to the influence of the legislator he could not lodge a complaint with police against him and alleged that he has received threats. The MLA, however, dismissed the priestтАЩs claim as false. тАЬI did not threaten or intimidate her family members or lure Soundarya. Our marriage was based on mutual consent,тАЭ Prabhu said. тАФ PTI Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

Published: 11th October 2020 07:48 AM | Last Updated: 11th October 2020 08:38 AM | A+A A- Activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the death of Hathras gang rape victim. (Photo | PTI) JAIPUR/PATNA: A Dalit woman in Bhopar village of RajasthanтАЩs Dausa district was allegedly raped by two boys, Mahendra and Jeetram, belonging to the Gujjar community in July 2019. When her family members lodged an FIR, the dominant caste was so enraged that they burnt her house, thrashed her family members and even threatened to kill all of them. Petrified by the repeated threats, the victim and her family fled to Mahua town, about 10 km from their village, where they eke out a living as labourers earning only Rs 500-600 a day. тАЬOur family members were beaten and our house was burnt down. We were threatened that we would be killed if we did not leave the village. The police took money from the accused and did not help us. The government also did not give us any compensation,тАЭ said Mahesh Chand, the victimтАЩs brother-in-law. The Dausa familyтАЩs troubles only underline what many Dalit victims of atrocities face. Just like the Hathras rape victimтАЩs family, which has alleged that Thakurs, the community to which the accused belong, are threatening them to leave the village, the travails of many Dalit families who face atrocities do not end with the crime committed against them. The upper castes hound the Dalits to such an extent that many are forced to flee their village and relocate elsewhere, where they struggle for a living without government support. In the same Dausa district, five men in a car allegedly raped a minor during a wedding ceremony at her neighbourhood in June 2017 in Dhigariya Kapur village. Some of the accused belonged to the upper caste. After an FIR was registered, the victimтАЩs family was threatened and told to settle the case. But when they did not, the threats increased to such an extent that the minorтАЩs family fled to the neighbouring Bharatpur district. тАЬWe had to leave the village as we couldnтАЩt live with the culprits around us. They would stalk us on trial dates. They also forcibly took away our 4 bighas of land. My father now runs a small tea stall,тАЭ the victimтАЩs brother said. Yet another rape victim and her family had to flee Bharatpur and live in Jaipur. The 50-year-old woman still recalls the day in June 1998 when a strongman in her village, Attar Singh Gujjar, found her working alone in her farm and raped her. When she went to file an FIR, the local toughies colluded with the police and stalled the registration of an FIR, she alleged. But her troubles didnтАЩt end there. In 2002 when she became a ward panch in BharatpurтАЩs Gothasar Bair tehsil, Attar Singh, who had raped her in 1998, was the sarpanch. When she pointed out some irregularities and complained to the IG Police of Bharatpur against Attar Singh, he and his goons beat her husband so severely that he lost both his legs. In 2014, families left Gaya after murder of Dalit youth The six culprits were sent to a seven-year jail term. But when they were released after three months, they began threatening her. The police failed to provide any protection and eventually they were forced to flee the village. These kinds of examples are not restricted to Rajasthan alone. In Bihar, too, Dalits have had to flee in fear. In 2014, a dozen lower caste families had to leave BiharтАЩs Gaya district following the murder of a Dalit youth. Arjun Manjhi. He was killed allegedly after he filed his nomination papers to contest the panchayat elections. A non-governmental organisation in Jaipur, the Centre for Dalit Human Rights, has submitted a list of 17 documented cases to the Rajasthan High Court in which Dalit families had to flee their homes following threats from powerful upper castes. тАЬThe governmental system has not changed and there is no political will to tackle such atrocities. As a result, the administration remains a mute spectator as powerful castes continue to oppress Dalits and other weaker sections,тАЭ said Satish Kumar, the centreтАЩs director. Take over Hathras probe, Centre asks CBI The Centre has issued a notification for the CBI to take over the probe into the alleged gang-rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, officials said on Saturday. The notification has been marked to a suitable branch of the premier agency, and probe teams will be dispatched to the crime scene along with forensic experts immediately after the registration of an FIR, they said. The Dalit woman had died of grievous injuries at a Delhi hospital on September 29, a fortnight after she was allegedly raped at her village by four upper-caste men. MHA letter on crimes against women The Centre on Saturday reminded the states and Union Territories of the existing laws for тАЬmandatory action by police in cases of crimes against women.тАЭ In an advisory, the Ministry of Home Affairs asked them to ensure strict compliance of laws pertaining to crimes against women and pointed out three sections of the CrPC that deal with тАЬcompulsory registration of FIR,тАЭ completion of investigation (in relation to rape) within 60 days and a mandatory medical examination with the individualтАЩs consent within 24 hours of receipt of information of such a crime.

"795",7034,"http://globalindianstories.com/index.php/2020/10/03/dalit-organisations-in-the-uk-demand-justice-for-manisha-valmiki/","Dalit organisations in the UK demand justice for Manisha Valmiki - Global Indian Stories","The brutal gang rape and death of 19-year-old Manisha Valmiki, belonging to a lower caste from Hathras in the the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, and the police action thereafter has sent shock waves all over the world. This brutality committed by perpetrators from an upper caste, as caste motivated hate crimes, must be condemned in the strongest way. Dalit and human rights organisations in the UK have issued an open joint statement condemning this heinous crime and demanding strict action against the culprits and also against those officials who tried to cover up this incident. Atrocities against women have become a matter of concern and shame for all who love humanity and India. Santosh Dass MBE, President, FABO UK said that the case of Miss Manisha Valmiki is yet another sickening gang rape and murder of a Dalit woman that has caused global outrage. тАЬEverything about the clear failure and cover-up in handling of this case is abhorrent, including reports that ManishaтАЩs body was set alight by petrol in a so-called cremation in the middle of the night. Members of ManishaтАЩs family were not allowed to conduct the funeral, be present, or to carry out the last rites. This is cruelty beyond measure. My heart as a woman and mother bleeds knowing this.тАЭ тАЬThe Chief Minister of UP, Mr Yogi Adityanath, whose worldview on women is that they are not capable of being left free or independent, must resign. We also demand that he and the police officers and officials concerned must be charged under the SC/ST Atrocities Act and the rapists be arrested,тАЭ she said. Arun Kumar, the General Secretary, FABO UK said that the gang rape of this young Dalit woman is not the first one and wonтАЩt be the last one. тАЬWe read stories every day where Dalit women are beaten, paraded naked, raped, and killed. The numbers are increasing every day. After this brutal incident, such crimes have occurred in Balrampur, Azamgarh, and Bulandshehar. These are all caste motivated hate crimes. These brutalities become news items and are forgotten. It is time to act and stop these heinous crimes. The culprits must be punished in a set period of time. The officials who try to cover up such crimes must be sacked and charged.тАЭ Arun said that if India wants to become a world leader, it must respect and give equal treatment to all, irrespective of their caste, religion, and gender. An open joint statement undersigned by Dalit and other organisations in the UK was submitted to the High Commissioner of India in London and read as follows: Open Joint Statement to the High Commissioner of India in London for the attention of the Prime Minister of India тАУ 2 October 2020 1. We the undersigned organisations and our supporters demand immediate justice for Miss Manisha Valmiki who died in hospital on 29 September 2020 from extreme injuries sustained from a brutal gang-rape on 14 September in Hathras, Utter Pradesh (UP), India. 2. Amongst our demands below, we also demand the resignation of the Chief Minister of UP and that the police officers involved be charged under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. Enough is enough! 3. Miss Manisha ValmikiтАЩs is yet another sickening gang rape and murder of a Dalit woman that has caused global outrage. This case raises many serious questions about the apathy of the Indian government, police and the hospital authorities. Despite repeated pleas from the family, the local police failed to register a case of gang rape leaving the accused to roam around free for five days. 4. If Miss ManishaтАЩs death wasnтАЩt enough, the local police officers and officials violated her dead body and cremated it in the middle of the night without allowing members of her family to be present or to carry out the last rites. This is cruelty beyond measure. Furthermore, it is reported the police are stopping politicians meeting the family to support and sympathise with them. It is also reported the family have been threatened and their phones have been confiscated. We will never forgive or forget this тАУ how India is failing its daughters. 5. Miss ManishaтАЩs murder has once again shone a light on IndiaтАЩs horrific Caste system, a system that ranks human value based on the presumed supremacy of the so-called high Castes. IndiaтАЩs Government despite its slogan тАШBeti bachao, beti padhaoтАЩ has failed Dalit girls and women. Dalit lives are considered worthless and have been for millennia. Essentially, the Indian Government has failed Indians. 6. The Guardian rightly reported on 1 October тАЬIndia is the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman and it is women from the lower castes who bear the brunt of the sexual violenceтАЭ. The 2019 data Crime in India states 10 Dalit women were raped in India everyday. One third of these cases were reported from the lawless states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Reported is the operative word. A culture of patriarchy and maintaining family honour means there are many more that are not formally reported to the police. 7. In other cases there is evidence police fail to even register the crimes. This is unacceptable. These casual rapes and gang rapes of Dalit women and girls, where so-called high Caste rapists go free with impunity point to a failed democracy and sick society. 8. From 2018, the rate of crime against all women in India has risen by 7.3%, with the country recording an average 87 rape cases every day in 2019. India reported 405,861 cases of crimes against women in 2019 and Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to the annual National Crime Record BureauтАЩs тАЬCrime in IndiaтАЭ 2019 report. 9. Miss Manisha Valmiki has been subjected to a horrendous, serious and brutal crime.

Leaders of different political parties also took part in the Protest saying the UP government has no right to stay in power alleging that the culprits are being shielded because they happen to be from the CMтАЩs caste.  Leaders and activists described the Yogi government with тАЬjungle raj , ghoonda raj, lawlessnessтАЭ and asked him to step down in the wake of Hatras gangrape and brutal murder of 19- year girl Manisha on September 14. Opposition leaders, including Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Dr S Q R Ilyas, Chandrashekhar Azad, and Brinda Karat, were seen at the protest, while activists such as Jignesh Mevani, Prashant Bhushan and Kanhaiya Kumar were among the demonstrators as well actor Swara Bhasker was present there, too. Protesters hold placards at Jantar Mantar to protest against the death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, in New Delhi. Addressing the protesters, they all sought resignation of UP CM. Left leaders questioned the silence of the Modi government over the issue. тАЬThe silence of the central government and the top leadership of the BJP on such a heinous crime and the UP governmentтАЩs response thereafter speak volumes about the authoritarian and anti-democratic тАШchehraтАЩ, тАШchaalтАЩ, тАШcharitraтАЩ, and тАШchintanтАЩ of the ruling party,тАЭ said Yechury as saying. тАЬThe Uttar Pradesh government has no right to stay in power. Our demand is that justice should be served,тАЭ he added. AAP National Convenor and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal demanded that the culprits should be hanged till death so that such an incident is never repeated in the country. Aam Aadmi PartyтАЩs chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, тАЬMedia and the BJP are repeatedly asking why the people are protesting against the Hathras rape case.тАЭ He recalled that lakhs of people gathered at India Gate to demand justice for Nirbhaya, while there were many rape incidents even before Nirbhaya and even after Nirbhaya. The reason that the people have joined today in huge numbers is that in this rape case of Hathras because all the police and civil officers standing with the accused? No administrative officer stands with the victimтАЩs family. Even today, the victimтАЩs family has been locked inside their house, and they are not allowed to talk to the media. All the officers have been given directions that no politician should be allowed to meet the victimтАЩs family as Yogi Adityanath is standing with the accusedтАЭ He also pointed out that Yogi Adityanath comes from the Thakur family and all the accused in the rape incident also belong to the Thakur family. тАЬCM Yogi is standing with Thakurs and so, no Thakur accused in Yogi Adityanath state can be punished. The only way to punish the accused in Uttar Pradesh is to remove Yogi Adityanath from the position of Chief Minister,тАЭ added Saurabh Bhardwaj. While addressing the protesters Bollywood actor Swara Bhaskar said. тАЬPeople from different groups are here, this shows how enraged people are against what happened in Hathras, Balrampur, and AzamgarghтАжthere is a rape epidemic which has spread in the country, especially the kind of news we are getting from Uttar Pradesh. Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad joined the protest over Hathras case at Jantar Mantar on Friday. тАЬI will visit Hathras. Our struggle will continue till the time UP CM doesnтАЩt resign, & justice is served. I urge SC to take cognizance of the incident,тАЭ he said. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, accompanying Chandrashekar asked тАЬWhy the BJP government is not allowing the protest at India Gate in case of Hathras Dalit womanтАЩs gangrape and murderтАЭ? Activist and lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the UP is witnessing тАЬghoonda rajтАЭ. тАШIn Uttar Pradesh, there is ghoonda raj. The police have surrounded the village, are not allowing opposition leaders and media people to set foot in the village. They have taken away the mobile phones of the family members of the victimтАЩ ,a and lawyer Prashant Bhushan said. Welfare Party of India (WPI) president Dr. Ilyas said Yogi failed to rule the state and he must go. Jamaat-e-Islami Hind Vice-president Engineer Mohammad Salim also took part in the demonstration. In his address, he said the role of the UP government did not bode well for the future of the democracy and the rule of law in the country. Even people are not allowed to meet the victimтАЩs family. Earlier in the day, ahead of the planned protests, Delhi Police had said that no gathering will be allowed around India Gate due to restrictions imposed under Section 144. Then it was shifted to Jantar Mantar. There are reports that Protest staged at many cities across the country in demanding the resignation of Yogi. It is to be mentioned that the 19-year-old Dalit woman had been dragged away from the fields where she was cutting grass and brutally raped by four Thakur men in her village on September 14. She succumbed to her injuries at DelhiтАЩs Safdarjung hospital two weeks later on September 29. Even with media on the ground, police forced the cremation of the victim after midnight on Wednesday (September 30), by locking up the family. Meanwhile, The Delhi Police on Friday registered a case against protestors, who had gathered at Jantar Mantar here against the alleged gang-rape and assault of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar PradeshтАЭs Hathras district, for violation of prohibitory orders, officials said.

These young men and women, affiliated with different studentsтАЩ organisations, have come to express their solidarity with Rita in her fight for justice for an incident which has claimed the life of her adopted daughter Seema*. Recently, Seema was found hanging in a house in upscale Model Town area where she had just begun working as a full time domestic helper to an elderly woman. Delhi Police, in its investigation, found that the girl had died due to asphyxia and it was тАШsuicidal in natureтАЩ, but it did not register any FIR in the matter. However, Rita is certain that her daughter was raped and murdered. RitaтАЩs story is an example of what happens when the poor seek for justice. She came to Delhi from Basti district of Uttar Pradesh with her husband, Ramesh*, in 2004 in search of livelihood. Hailing from a family of boatmen belonging Nishad community, a scheduled caste in Northern India, Rita lives with her family of seven in her 10x6 room in North DelhiтАЩs Rajpura Gud mandi near Delhi University. She and her sister work as domestic helpers in nearby areas to sustain their livelihoods. Her husband lost his job as a plumber during the nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic. Her daughter, Seema, had also joined the same work but had taken a break after working for few months in Rajouri Garden. Seema was later shifted to another home in the Model Town colony where the employer was an old lady who promised her a monthly salary of Rs 11,000. But just a week later, she was found hanging from the ceiling in the driverтАЩs room at her new workplace. Rita had adopted Seema after her sister had died and her alcoholic husband had no interest in raising the children. The family had decided that every brother and sister will take responsibility for raising the three children. Narrating the episode of SeemaтАЩs death, Rita told NewsClick, тАЬI got a message in our WhatsApp group that a family needed a domestic helper. So, we went to meet Renu Mittal, the employerтАЩs daughter, who lives in Kamla Nagar to discuss the work. After the discussion, Seema joined the work on September 28. I had briefly talked to her on October 1, 2 and 4. The employer had few complaints regarding the work. I assured her that she would easily learn it. The employer ensured that she would talk to family members in her presence only.тАЭ Also read: DUJ тАЬShockedтАЭ at Delhi Police Assault on Caravan Journalist, Calls for тАЬExemplaryтАЭ Action She added, тАЬOn October 4, we received a call from employer to take our daughter back. Soon, Renu Mittal came to us and took me to her motherтАЩs house. She told me to cite the age of girl as 19 instead of 17. When I reached the house, I saw the house was teeming with a fleet of policemen in uniform as well as plain clothes. They asked me about her credentials, her age, who we were. I repeatedly asked them to allow me to meet my daughter. They said they would soon allow me. Few hours later, I was told to meet her but not to touch her or any belonging in the room. This sentence alerted me. When I saw her, she was standing with her back on my side but when I looked at her face, she was hanging from the ceiling. There were burn marks on her hands too. I started crying. I was rushed out of the room.тАЭ тАЬLater, the police officials told me that my daughter had killed herself. I could not believe it. I still do not believe it. Why would a happy girl like her take such an extreme step? I had constantly asked her if she had any problems and she always said she was fine. The strangest thing about the incident is that she was found hanging in the driverтАЩs room. Why would she [employer] send her to driverтАЩs room when the employer knew that she was a girl?,тАЭ Rita questioned. However, the real ordeal began only after the incident. She said, тАЬPolice took the dead body to an unknown place whereas we were brought to Model Town Police Station to record our statements. We were made to sit till 2 oтАЩclock in the night but they did not reveal the whereabouts of the dead body. Seema did not have any Aadhaar card or any identification card. The police official asked us about the proof of our relationship. They said only the father of the deceased would be allowed to see the body or else the body will be marked as тАШunidentifiedтАЩ and will be treated accordingly. The father had been drug addict and remained untraceable. Even her sister was refused for identification.тАЭ Talking further about the attitude of the policemen as well as the deceased girlтАЩs employers, she added, тАЬWith no option left, we went to the employerтАЩs house on October 7 to find out tge whereabouts of the body. The attitude of the employer irked us and we pelted stones and broke pots. The lady called the police and we were detained. The policemen took us to the police station and started beating us mercilessly. They beat one of my family members so badly that he almost stopped breathing. When we pleaded, the policemen said that they ensure that we flee from Delhi and our children will be taken care by neighbours.тАЭ Three days later on October 8, when SeemaтАЩs father finally arrived from Bahraich, the body was identified and sent for post mortem, she said, adding that even then, police did not reveal where the body was taken for post mortem. тАЬWe came to know about the place from the people outside the mortuary. We were asked to go to the crematorium. We resisted the move. We told them explicitly that women do not go to cremation ground in our tradition but they did not relent. The policemen cremated the body at Wazirpur Crematorium,тАЭ Rita said. Also read: Hathras Rape Case: Grappling with Ground Realities of the Implementation SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act Even though they had requested for a fresh probe into the case as they were not satisfied with the investigation, their request have been rejected, she alleged, adding, тАЬWe pleaded to police officials and made it clear that our girl could not die by suicide. Still, no police official has interrogated the employer or her son and drivers. No sane person can understand the silence of the police officers.тАЭ Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, a member of Lawyers Against Atrocities, who has been helping the family members legally, told NewsClick that the police did not follow the protocol under Indian Penal Code. He said, тАЬUnder Indian Penal Code, the police is directed to register the case under section 166 A for any sexually cognisable offence. The police did not do it. Similarly, the post mortem should have been done within 24 hours but it was delayed to four days. Now, you know even if there was any fluid on the body at time of crime, it may no longer exist for four days. I got the post mortem report assessed by independent doctors and they are suggesting that it was not conducted from the angle of rape. The biggest fault remains about the cremation of body. Why did police cremate the body? Certainly, Hathras was repeated in Delhi. If there was no rape, it would have certainly been highlighted in another report. We are awaiting for viscera report and will proceed accordingly.тАЭ Following this, the victimтАЩs family members and studentsтАЩ organisations including Bhagat Singh Ekta Manch, Krantikari Yuva Sangathan, All India StudentsтАЩ Association and StudentsтАЩ Federation of India protested outside the Model Town PS on October 16. However, the police detained them and booked them under Epidemic Act, Disaster Management Act and other provisions of Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy. The organisations, in their collective statement, have demanded immediate registration of FIR against the accused under relevant sections of IPC and SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They have also demanded action to be taken against the police personnel involved in committing procedural lapses and forceful cremation of the victim's body. Sitting tired and restless in her tiny room, Rita finally said, тАЬI never thought this would happen to us. I never forced her to work. Even when she started working, I thought that I would make jewellery for her marriage from the saved money. Now, she is gone.тАЭ But she is also determined to fight for justice, as she said, тАЬEven though they tried to frighten us, we are not afraid. We have been treated in this manner because we are poor dalits. But they are forgetting one thing, poor also have rights. We will claim it.тАЭ *The names of the family members have been changed to protect their identities.","IND","dalit",1,1,NA,NA

Quoting sources, a report by Times of India, said that out of the 100 crore Rs 50 crore came from Mauritius. ED officials are tracking some suspects and dissecting data pertaining to the blacklisted website тАЬJustice for HathrasтАЭ to ascertain whether it was used as a gateway for foreign funding, the report said. Accounts to which money was transferred are also being scanned. The ED is planning to start a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the admins of the website. Earlier on Monday, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had said that тАЬa host of organisationsтАЭ were using foreign funding to hatch conspiracies to derail his governmentтАЩs development agenda тАЬby stoking caste conflictsтАЭ. However, the Chief Minister of the state had not taken the name of any organisation or person. The ED is also likely to conduct an inquiry from domain servers, the details of the money received and its utilisation. The ED probe may also cover the ultimate beneficiaries of the funds received by the website. On September 14, in Hathras a 19-year-old Dalit woman was abducted by a gang of four upper-caste Hindu men from the villageтАЩs Thakur community from the nearby agricultural field where she had gone for grass cutting. Her mother says that she did not тАЬnotice the scuffleтАЭ, as she is hard of hearing, according to a report by The Wire. However, barely few minutes had passed and she saw her daughter in a pool of blood a few feet away from her. According to her mother, the young woman was badly assaulted тАУ her tongue wounded, her spinal cord and neck severally bruised, which reportedly left her paralysed and she was not able to stand up. Later, when the woman was driven to the hospital, her post-mortem report revealed that she was strangulated and had suffered severe injuries in her spine. The marks on the neck of the victim are consistent with attempted strangulation reports claim. тАЬAlleged history of strangulation by some unknown persons from behind with dupatta while she was doing some work in the field on 14, 09, 2020 at around 4:10 pm, where on examination she was conscious and oriented to time, place and person, ligature mark was present over the front of her neck.тАЭ the report mentions. Initially, there was no rape case lodged but only a case of attempt to murder and one under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Later, on regaining conscious, when the woman gave a statement to police, a rape case was subsequently registered. She was admitted first to a hospital in Hathras and later moved to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh for advanced treatment. More than a week later on September 27, Police arrested four persons including Sandeep (20), his uncle Ravi (35) and their friends Luv Kush (23) and Ramu (26). All four of them were named by the victim and remain under judicial custody. Next day, as the womanтАЩs condition deteriorated, she was rushed to the Safdurjung Hospital in Delhi; however, she could survive only a few hours in the hospital and succumbed to her injuries. Fearing demonstrations, police later refused to hand over her body to the family. By then, several activists from various groups had reached the hospital and begun a dharna demanding justice for her. A spokesperson of the hospital later confirmed that the womanтАЩs legs had been completely paralysed and arms partially paralysed. The womanтАЩs brother in a report byNDTV says that his family members had gone to the field to get some grass. While his elder brother went home earlier, his mother and sister continued to cut the grass and were quite far from each other. Four-five men come from behind and dragged his sister by her dupatta inside the bajra field. On realising her daughter was missing, the mother goes looking for her and later finds her unconscious. In this regard, the victimтАЩs have accused the Uttar Pradesh police of not helping them initially but took action only after four-five days. However, the state police denied the allegations put on them by the family. The deceased came from Valmiki samaaj, a large cluster of caste, recognised as scheduled castes or Dalits by the 2011 census of UP. In the victimтАЩs district, Valmiki families number just about 15. Out of the 600-odd families, nearly half are Thakur (upper-caste Rajputs), and Brahmins another 100-odd. The village pradhan, denies any caste tension saying those who alleged so were тАЬlyingтАЭ and claiming that the Panchayat was for тАЬeveryoneтАЭ. тАЬI canтАЩt speak for all but I havenтАЩt witnessed any such acts. I speak to people irrespective of their caste and listen to their complaintsтАж This is a peaceful placeтАЭ he says in an Indian Express report. Besides others, the former Chief Minister of UP and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has demanded that the accused should be tried in a fast-track court. тАЬThe news of the death of Dalit victim after gangrape in Hathras, UP is very saddening. The government should provide all possible help to the victimтАЩs family and ensure fast punishment to the culprits by prosecuting them in a fast track court. This is the demand of the BSP,тАЭ she says. Pertinently, a report released in January this year by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Uttar Pradesh is ranked as the worst for womenтАЩs security, followed by Madhya Pradesh as the state where rape is most rampant. The total number of cases of crime against women in 2018 stood at 378,277, of which Uttar Pradesh alone had 59,445 cases of crimes against women. Madhya Pradesh registered the maximum number of rapes at 5,450, nearly 15 a day. The overall number of crimes against women has risen steadily from 322,929 in 2016, to 345,989 in 2017, and 378,277 in 2018.  Free Press Kashmir is now on Telegram.

The Ambedkarite organizations from USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Nederland, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Japan, Korea, Singapore, New Zealand, Belgium, Hungary, Australia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Malaysia demanded immediate prosecution of the culprits under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. тАЬOur sister lost her life on September 29th, 2020, in a Delhi hospital, after she succumbed to the injuries because of the hate crime where she was raped, her tongue was slashed, spinal cord broken and she was left to die by some men from the caste Hindu Thakur community. In an alleged attempt to destroy the evidence, her body was forcefully cremated by the UP police, which literally caused her second death. This happened against the wishes of the family, who were begging in front of the authorities to see their daughter one last time and who were then heckled and locked up,тАЭ a joint statement reads. The statement referred an India Spend Analysis of the National Crime Records Bureau statistics and said the crimes against Dalits rose by 746% from 2006 to 2016 in India. The Ambedkarite organizations further said: тАЬThe Dalits have increased vulnerability to such crimes due to the casteist mindset of Caste Hindus, who have a predominant presence in the police force and administration. There have been malicious attempts at obstructing justice, in the form of refusal of the police to file FIRтАЩs, refusal to use the POA Act, 1989, threatening of the victimтАЩs families by the perpetrators and preventing the victim from seeking justice (For instance, the 17 year old Unnao Dalit rape victim was burnt on her way to the court hearing. The convict is a member of the ruling dispensation). Thus, the obstruction of justice often happens with the complicity of the administration and government.тАЭ They claimed that the conviction rate for the men accused of raping dalit women is almost nil. The organizations accused IndiaтАЩs Supreme Court of diluting the only legal safeguard against the heinous caste crimes and atrocities against the Dalits i.e.The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. They said: тАЬThe Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, needs not just to be brought back in its original form but also given more teeth to tackle the rising caste hate crimes against Dalits and offer protection to the Dalit women and child victims.тАЭ тАЬThe difference between rape, murders and other from of atrocities against the Dalits and similar crimes against other people, is that the crimes against dalits are caste hate crimes arising out of casteist mindset of Caste Hindus. Such crimes are a reflection of jealousy, hate toward and intolerance of the little progress the Dalits have been achieving,тАЭ reads the statement.

"804",7111,"https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/10-dalit-women-speakers-india-everyone-must-be-listening-to-right-now/","Pass The Mic: 10 Dalit Women Speakers Everyone Must Be Listening To Right Now - SheThePeople TV","National outrage against rape crimes has only been mounting in the aftermath of the death of the Dalit woman who died recently succumbing to the injuries inflicted by four upper-caste men who gangraped her in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Unfortunately, it took the death of a young woman to serve as a moment of upheaval in the collective consciousness of people and jolt them to the vicious intersection of caste and gender-based crimes in India. The caste hierarchy is one of those structures that are still tethering India to a deep-set foundation of├В patriarchy, misogyny, power politics, and social discrimination. The idea of caste is rudimentary and represents a social divide that has been impossible to mend in India even in the 21st century. But why does traditional social exclusion still plague us? One of the prime reasons for this is the lack of diverse voices in the mainstream. Also Read:├В Why ItтАЩs Necessary To Acknowledge Caste In Crime Cases Like Hathras Gang Rape The need of the hour is to clear the area and give maximum space to Dalit women to speak. Here are some who are actively spearheading the fight against caste and are vocal in public forums. Their social media handles have been linked for you to follow: Cynthia Stephen is an independent researcher├В on gender, poverty, development, and policy. Based in Bangalore, she is an activist and writer, with over 30 years of experience. During her leadership tenure with the Karnataka government, Stephen was always a strong advocate of ensuring equal policy, and has championed the rights of Dalit women on various committees. In the aftermath of the Hathras gangrape incident, Stephen in an article Why We Face An Uphill Battle For Citizenship And Dignity for Dalit Women├В published on SheThePeople wrote, тАЬThe life of a human being varies with their position in the├В caste├В hierarchy. Women are only objects who fulfil domestic, ritual and reproductive roles in a patriarchal family.├В The untouchables don├в┬А┬Щt even figure in the law book as they are outside the pale of the four castes.├В Women and Dalits are non-citizens, non-people as far as it (the Indian state) is concernedтАж├В This is the core reason for the ever-burgeoning├В crimes against Dalits├В in India. There are plenty of laws on paper to protect them from exploitation but the crimes continue.тАЭ An advocate in the Supreme Court of India,├В MunusamyтАЩs is a significant anti-caste voice in the country. As a writer, researcher, and founder of organisations promoting equality, she describes herself as тАЬA judicial activist striving for social justice by eliminating all forms of discriminations, oppressions and inequalities├В in the society.тАЭ├В In an interview with SheThePeople, Munusamy emphasised on the need for giving Dalit women space to speak. тАЬI have seen many upper-caste liberals who participate in protests or movements which are seen as тАШdecentтАЩ. They also donтАЩt know how to pass the mic and sit back, and not take the reward for what they have been doing. If they are a true ally, they would work even if they are not rewarded. I, as a Dalit woman, am not invited to Dalit collectives, but Brahmin women are sitting there. How?тАЭ Speaking about casteist policies which are fuelled through administrative policies, she says, тАЬAll of us need to stand against womenтАЩs oppression, Islamophobia, violation of the LGBTQIA community. This has to become an anti-status quo revolutionary movement. It has to have leadership from the oppressed community.тАЭ With over 40 years of fight for equality, Dr Ruth Manorama is one of the longest-standing activists for Dalit rights, with a deep focus on women from the community, and rights for unorganised labour in India. She has done monumental work as a writer and researcher over decades on Dalit women under the draconian caste hierarchy. Based in Bangalore, Manorama has served in organiser and leadership positions on seats with the National Federation of Dalit Women (NFDW) and├В Women├в┬А┬Щs Voice. She was also awarded the prestigious├В Right Livelihood Award, also known as the тАЬalternative Nobel prizeтАЭ for human rights, in 2006. Speaking on the Hathras case, Manorama said, тАЬI feel very humiliated and angryтАж Dalit women are like fodder in all kinds of atrocities. They violate Dalit women├в┬А┬Щs dignity in order to shame the whole community. There is a connivance between the state and the powerful upper caste non-state actors. How long can one tolerate such things?тАЭ Radhika Vemula is the mother of Rohith Vemula, PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad, who├В reportedly died by suicide in 2016 following his suspension by authorities, and targeting by other students at the university. In the deeply reflective suicide note he left behind, Vemula had mentioned, тАЬThe value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibilityтАж├В My birth is my fatal accident.тАЭ His death had sparked off nationwide protests and calls-to-action of ending caste discrimination at the university and institutional level in India, with Radhika Vemula at the forefront. In the four years since her sonтАЩs death, she has emerged as a torchbearer of social activism started by her son, saying, тАЬRohith left me a huge responsibility. I will not rest until I have fulfilled it. As a mother, I am still experiencing grief. But that will not stop me or even slow me down.тАЭ She says her fight is now not just for Dalit students and women, but ostracised minorities across India: тАЬIt├в┬А┬Щs no longer about just my son. I will raise my voice for all oppressed people and I will not let another Rohith die.тАЭ Also Read:├В After Delhi, Hyderabad, Now Hathras: Executions And Encounters HavenтАЩt Curbed Gangrapes Dutt is a writer-journalist currently based in New York City. A Columbia School graduate, Dutt has previously worked with publications like Hindustan Times and Asian Age. She has authored the book├В Coming out as Dalit, and is a vocal leader of Dalit activism on social media. In talk surrounding the Hathras case, she has actively been taking the baton of logical conversation forward. On Twitter, she wrote, тАЬWhat├в┬А┬Щs wrong is our adherence to caste supremacy allowing ├в┬А┬Шupper├в┬А┬Щ caste men to mutilate the bodies of Dalit women for sport or to teach the community a lesson in never forgetting their place at the bottom. And the willful ignorance of the rest of us who refuse to accept that.тАЭ Vijayashanthi Murthy is currently an Assistant Professor at St. JosephтАЩs College, Bengaluru. She has previously held teaching positions at Jain University and Baduku Community College, both in Bengaluru as well. Through her teaching career, she has attempted to keep her students sensitised and aware as to the atrocities the Dalit community is subjected to, keeping her classrooms open to discussion always. In├В a discussion on caste-based violence against women conducted by SheThePeople, Murthy noted how the hierarchy works in such bureaucratic systems: ├в┬А┬ЬPeople from Dalit and other communities who get into these systems, more often than not get spaces in the lower ranks of the structure. The power rests in the hands of dominant castes. In the police for instance├в┬А┬ж it├в┬А┬Щs not a functional hierarchy; it├в┬А┬Щs an evident caste hierarchy. Or in the judiciary ├в┬А┬У How many High Court judges have been from the Dalit community? How many women have we had? Or media or academia.├в┬А┬Э Along with being a Dalit rights activist, Grace Banu is also a historic woman by virtue of being the first transgender person to be admitted to an engineering college in Tamil Nadu and also IndiaтАЩs first trans engineer. Banu has been vocal about her life experiences as a Dalit woman, saying that she was subjected to untouchability during her school years, and then later faced rejection by her family upon coming out with her sexual orientation. She has been a staunch supporter of the Reservations system, believing that it is necessary for the inclusion of oppressed communities like Dalits and transpersons into the fold of mainstream. She said in an interview, тАЬNo amount of temporary governmental and non-governmental schemes can have the transgenerational impact that reservations can have. Reservations are the only way.тАЭ Riya Singh is a doctoral researcher at├В DelhiтАЩs Ambedkar University. She works as the Research and Advocacy Officer at Dalit Women Fight, which is├В India├в┬А┬Щs largest Dalit women-led collective that wants to тАЬeffectively challenge,tackle, and solve caste-based violence and discrimination.тАЭ Her work with victims of caste atrocities has been expansive.├В In a recent article, she pointed out the problem of calling the Hathras victim тАЬanother NirbhayaтАЭ, as the media and several protestors have been doing. During a panel by SheThePeople, Singh emphasised, тАЬIтАЩve never understood the need of explaining why caste is important in a caste-based crime. Caste is right in front of our eyesтАж The first thing people ask is what is your name? If you give your first name, theyтАЩll ask you тАУ├В aage kya hai?├В (for surname). But Indian society is hesitant about claiming caste pride when it is about bad things.тАЭ Beena Pallical is a Dalit activist currently serving as the General Secretary of Economic and Educational Rights for the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR). She has previously occupied roles in several leadership positions in both the state and central governments, working towards gender equality and caste annihilation. Through her groundwork, she has actively trained and advised Adivasi and Dalit women in becoming financially independent. She is a major voice of the voiceless communities in India, having represented them on multiple forums. On how to begin reforming the injustices of caste hierarchy, Pallical said, тАЬAs long as the mindset of discrimination and untouchability exist, violence will continue. The only way we can undo is by implementing the existing policies.тАЭ Meena Kandasamy├В is a poet, columnist,├В translator, and activist, who has authored multiple significant works on the condition and experiences of Dalits in India.

A much-forgotten Lok Sabha by-election in 1985 in Bijnor, in western Uttar Pradesh, symptomatised this flowering, which now looks increasingly endangered. Across India, particularly in the northern states of UP and Bihar, political parties representing the Dalit voice have weakened. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati is a shadow of her former feisty self. Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has passed away. The Hindi heartland suddenly looks shorn of leaders who can fill the shoes of these two giants of contemporary Dalit politics. As the forthcoming Bihar assembly polls might show, Dalit assertion is at the risk of getting subsumed within the two big national parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. The Bijnor bypoll was held after the passing away of CongressтАЩ sitting MP Girdhari Lal. The Congress fielded debutante Meira Kumar, the daughter of Jagjivan Ram. Opposing her was Paswan, then with the Lok Dal. Both hailed from Bihar. The third candidate in the fray was Mayawati. The BSP was in its infancy then. The Rajiv Gandhi government was two years away from being discredited, but still Kumar struggled to beat Paswan, a third-term MP from BiharтАЩs Hajipur, by less than 6,000 votes. Mayawati, who could not contest on her partyтАЩs symbol as the BSP was still unrecognised, trailed at number three with over 61,000 votes, which would have mostly gone to the Congress. If Paswan and Mayawati punctured KumarтАЩs ambitions of becoming RamтАЩs legatee in UP, the BSP leader pushed Paswan to the number three spot in a Lok Sabha bypoll in Haridwar in 1987. The Congress candidate won. Mayawati was a close runner up. Embarrassingly for him, Paswan forfeited his deposit, never to contest from UP again. A year later, Kanshi Ram contested the high-profile Allahabad Lok Sabha by-election after superstar Amitabh Bachchan vacated the seat. Kanshi RamтАЩs opponents were the joint opposition candidate Vishwanath Pratap Singh and CongressтАЩ Sunil Shastri, son of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Singh defeated Shastri comfortably securing over 200,000 votes. Shastri failed to get even 100,000 as Kanshi Ram bagged almost 70,000 votes, most of which would have gone to the Congress. Soon the ruling Congress started smelling a тАШforeign handтАЩ in BSPтАЩs success. It resurrected its favourite bogey. There were allegations the United StatesтАЩ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was funding the BSPтАЩs election outings. The BSPтАЩs success worried the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) equally. RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras was quoted by the Illustrated Weekly of India in 1988 describing the BSP as тАЬone of the real problems for the RSS in north IndiaтАЭ. The BSP, along with the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, in UP; and Paswan, Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar in Bihar, shrunk the political space not just of the Congress, but also of the BJP and the RSS. In the rest of north India, where the Dalit and the OBC leaderships were absorbed by the two mainstream upper caste-led parties, politics became increasingly bipolar between the Congress and the BJP, and it continues to remain so in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. It was the political genius of Kanshi Ram to lay the foundation of the resurgence of Dalit politics by knitting an alliance between various Dalit and EBC (Extremely Backward Castes) in UP. He picked Mayawati, a Jatav, the predominant Dalit caste in UP, as their leader. Unfortunately, neither Paswan nor Mayawati prepared alternate leaderships to take forward this movement for Dalit assertion and their greater independent political representation. Instead, both attempted to secure their respective parties for their families, who in turn are pushing these parties to become puppets in the hands of the two big national parties. For Dalit politics, it seems it is set for a return to the тАШChamcha YugтАЩ, or the era of stooges, that Kanshi Ram described in his book of that name, which he had published on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Poona Pact of 1932. He said the Scheduled Caste elite is a stooge the upper caste elite have created to oppose the genuine fighter. Dalit activists, however, are not despairing. They believe this is a gestation period before dynamic leaders come to the fore to knit several Dalit castes, Pasmanda Muslims and the EBCs into a potent independent political force yet again, and not merely head Dalit тАШcellsтАЩ in national parties. For inspiration, the Dalit leaders turn to widespread protests across north India, which they see as having been spontaneous with disparate Dalit outfits coming together, on April 2, 2018, against the Supreme Court order that watered down the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

The protesting women тАУ mostly working тАУ were led by different groups at several demonstration sites. They pressed for a safe environment for women in cities across the country while demanding an immediate deliverance of justice to the dalit teen from Hathras. In a separate protest organised by a dalit organisation in the capital, similar demands were raised. A 19-year old girl, belonging to the landless Valmiki caste, was brutally assaulted and allegedly raped by four upper-caste, landed Thakur men in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Hathras district last month. On Thursday, organisations like the All India Democratic WomenтАЩs Association (AIDWA), National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW), and Satark Nagrik Sangathan (SNS) among others, took to the streets nationwide under the banner of Hum Agar Utthe Nahin Toh (If we do not rise), a campaign initiated this year on the third anniversary of the assassination of journalist-turned-activist Gauri Lankesh. The umbrella body now has over 400 womenтАЩs groups, LGBTQI collectives and human rights organisations spread across all the states in the country. In the national capital, protests were held throughout the day in areas including Mangolpuri, South DelhiтАЩs Jagdamba Camp, North East DelhiтАЩs Gurmandi, Nizamuddin, along with in industrial towns such as Narela and Bawana тАУ all comprising sizeable populations of economically-weaker sections of women engaged in construction and domestic work among other things. A common refrain of the women in these areas was the lack of safety and myriad occasions of harassments that they encounter, especially while returning to their home in the evening. тАЬThere are no street lights in my area; it has become a daily affair of coming across men тАУ usually drunk тАУ in the evenings who donтАЩt shy from passing lewd comments,тАЭ cried a woman, during the protest at Jagdamba Camp, adding that she does not feel safe at all. A 2019 survey estimated that over 40% of women report feeling тАЬunsafeтАЭ outdoors, while nearly 80% says that not much has been made by authorities to provide a safer environment for women in the country. тАЬWhat had happened to the girl in Hathras could very well happen to us any day,тАЭ lamented another woman at Bawana. тАЬThe police and other government machineries that are meant for our safety also seem to be failing the women,тАЭ she added. And hence, тАЬBadlaav chaiye, badlaa nahinтАЭ (want a change, not revenge) тАУ was the slogan picked up by the women during the protests as they vowed to тАЬstruggle till they register a win.тАЭ A nationwide protest was also called by the Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch (DSMM), a national platform тАЬfor action against caste discrimination and for social justice.тАЭ People assembled near Parliament Street and sloganeered against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in UP, which has been accused of тАЬprotectingтАЭ the perpetrators of the crime in Hathras. The demonstration was also joined by a group of lawyers, who are representing the family of a teenager from a backward class in Delhi. The 17-year old Delhi girl was discovered dead in the house where she had been working for a week as a domestic help. While her family had accused the employer of rape and murder, Delhi Police has failed to file an FIR even after more than a fortnight. The women-led protests were live streamed on social media platforms in what the organisers termed as a тАЬweb rally.тАЭ Leaders of various groups were joined in, along with some cultural artists, to voice their anger over rising atrocities against the marginalised sections. Similarly, other virtual meetings were organised to spread a political awareness among the women with regards to their rights and how they can hold the authority accountable. Anjali Bhardwaj, a founding member of SNS, highlighted the importance of the various machineries of the state to ensure womenтАЩs safety in the country. тАЬThe commissions тАУ that of SCs and STs and women тАУ along with the judiciary, and police must function properly. When they fail the people lose trust in the law and order processes,тАЭ she said. It is then, when demands of capital punishment are raised in matters relating to rapes, Bhardwaj says, adding that it is a wrong solution to the prevailing problems. To be sure, the latest Crime in India report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) notes as many as 88 rape cases took place every day in 2019, on an average, with conviction rate in these cases at alarmingly low level of about 27%. Shabnam Hashmi, a social activist and founding member of ANHAD (Act Now for Harmony and Democracy), a socio-cultural organisation, spoke about the grief of the victimтАЩs family in Hathras and demanded a time-bound justice in the matter. Hashmi was one among the eight-member women delegation, which had visited the victimтАЩs family in Hathras on October 5. She alleged, while addressing the web rally, that the victimтАЩs family had informed them then of being тАЬintimidated,тАЭ and accused the police administration of тАЬcausing delay at every step.тАЭ Currently, the matter is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), with the Allahabad High Court allowed by the apex court to monitor all aspects of the case.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

Rajeshwari, the Therukuthittai panchayat president in Cuddalore district, who belongs to Adi Dravidar community (categorised as Scheduled Caste) was forced to sit on the floor by Mohan, vice-president of the panchayat and a upper caste Hindu. Police arrested panchayat secretary Sindhuja while Mohan is absconding. The incident came to light after a picture of Rajeshwari sitting on the floor went viral. Mohan allegedly refused to conduct the meeting until Rajeshwari sat on the floor. The incident took place on 12 July. On Saturday Rajeshwari lodged a complaint with the Bhuvanagiri police after the picture went viral. The police have registered a case against Mohan under sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The district administration has issued a show cause notice to Mohan as he is still absconding, Collector Anbuselvan Cuddalore told reporters. Rajeshwari has reportedly been discriminated since she took oath as panchayat president last December. According to RajeshwariтАЩs husband Saravana Kumar Mohan, on a regular basis, used to treat her differently by claiming caste majority in the panchayat as she is the only Dalit leader among the members. The caste Hindu leaders would often threaten they would remove Rajeshwari from the post for not obeying them. Since they form a majority and they can bring a no-confidence motion against her, Rajeswari refrained from giving an official complaint. Saravana alleged that Mohan had threatened Rajeshwari that she should obey his orders, and that her life would be at stake if she did not agree. тАЬWe got scared and we finally lodged a complaint with the police,тАЭ he said. The caste Hindu leaders allegedly never allowed her to sit on a chair when they were around nor did they allow her to hoist the flag during the Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations. Anbuselvan said the information was not brought to the the district administrationтАЩs attention, and that he has ordered SindhujaтАЩs suspension. The Collector visited Rajeshwari and conducted an inquiry. A ward member R Sugumar has been arrested. <!-- e9 = new Object(); e9.size = ""300x250,300x600,160x600""; //--> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); ","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA
"817",7175,"https://mediaindia.eu/society/rape-murder-of-dalit-minor/","New Delhi police try to suppress alleged rape & murder of dalit minor"," Society October 27, 2020 / By Aman Kanojiya and Danish Mohammed / New Delhi Human rights activists joined in a protest by the family of a young dalit girl that had allegedly been raped and killed in New Delhi on October 4. Weeks after the gruesome rape and murder of a dalit girl in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, another similar incident has emerged in the national capital. A 17-year-old dalit girl, who worked as a house help in the Model Town locality, in North-west Delhi was allegedly raped and killed at her workplace on October 4. The family of the victim says that even though it has been more than 20 days since the incident, the police have refused to register the case and instead have been harassing them mentally and physically. тАЬDelhi Police refused to file a first information report on the death. Its personnel say it was a suicide, even without waiting for the results of the forensic examination. We have been brutally beaten by the police and kept in the lockup overnight,тАЭ Kusum, the foster mother of the victim, tells Media India Group. тАЬThe police did not allow us to take the body home and instead pressured us into quickly cremating the body,тАЭ she adds. After several failed attempts to get an FIR registered, the family along with the help of a few student organisations protested outside office of DCP North West, in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, to demand justice for the 17-year-old girl who belonged to the Nishad community (a Dalit community). The family members allege that the girl was raped and murdered by the son and driver of the landlady who she was supposed to be taking care of. They say that she began working there on September 26. The aunt of the deceased says that on the day of the incident, October 4, she received a call from her asking her to rush there and help her. However, she could not give any details as the landlady was next to her and the girl was not able to talk. The same evening Kusum was asked by the family of the landlady to go urgently to their house as the victim had тАШlocked herself in a room and was not opening the door. тАЬWhen I reached over there, I found several police personnel there and I felt anxious as I was worrying about my niece,тАЩтАЩ Kusum tells Media India Group. тАЬWhen I asked them that I wanted to immediately see my niece, the police did not allow me and just told me that I will get to see her soon. First they asked me several questions about the victim and our family and then they took me towards the room where she was supposed to be. From outside the room, I thought I could see her standing up, but when I went in, I was horrified to see that she was hanging from the ceiling,тАЭ says Kusum. The family says that the police did not hand over the body of the deceased even four days after the death and called the family for a quick cremation, refusing to handover the body so that it could be taken back to their native village for the last rites. Protestors outside the office of DCP North West, in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, demanding justice for the 17-year-old victim (MIG Photos) тАЬWe are from the Nishad community and in our community women are not allowed to perform the last rites. However, when we told the police that we want to take her body to our home for the last rites they didnтАЩt allow us to do that. Instead they pushed me in a van with her body for the last rites and said we are anyway going to burn her-with or without you,тАЭ says Suman, another aunt of the victim. Since then, the family of the victim has been fighting for justice, but without any luck as the police refused to even register an FIR and began dismissing the death as a suicide without any forensic evidence. This is not the first time that police have tried to suppress the rape and murder of a dalit girl. The New Delhi case has many similarities with the Hathras rape and murder case where another dalit girl was raped and murdered last month. The fight for justice in that case also has been going on since. According to a report by National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) тАУ National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, crimes against dalits increased by 6 pc from 2009 to 2018 with over 3,91,000 atrocities being reported, at the same time gaps in implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and the 1995 rules framed under it remained. The report, said that the crime rate against those belonging to Scheduled Tribes recorded a decrease of around 1.6 pc, with a total of 72,367 crimes being recorded in 2009-2018. The latest National Crime Records Bureau data show an increase of 7.3 pc in crimes against scheduled castes with 45,935 cases in 2019, up from 42,793 cases in 2018. Uttar Pradesh alone accounts for over 25 pc of the total cases by recording the highest number of atrocities against the dalits in the country. Rape constituted 7.6 pc of all cases of crimes against the dalits.{ ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""Article"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://mediaindia.eu/society/rape-murder-of-dalit-minor/"" }, ""headline"": ""New Delhi police try to suppress alleged rape & murder of dalit minor"", ""description"": ""Human rights activists joined in a protest by the family of a young dalit girl that had allegedly been raped and killed in New Delhi on October 4."", ""image"": ""https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gurmandi-rape.jpg"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Person"", ""name"": ""Aman Kanojiya"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": """", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": """" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2020-10-27"" } Your email address will not be published.

Dalit Teenaged Sisters Rape and Murder: Case Explained... | Life Matters"," Almost 11 months after Kerala HC allowed a retrial plea in the Walayar rape case, the minor victimsтАЩ parents have been forced to demand justice at Secretariat. Dalit teenaged sisters raped and murdered тАУ all accused, having suspected links with Marxist party leaders, acquitted due to shoddy probe by Kerala policeтАж Massive outrage is building up in Kerala civil society following the acquittal of all four persons in the rape and death case of two minor girls, who were siblings, at Walayar in Palakkad district of the Kerala in 2017. The elder sister, aged 13, was found hanging in her house on January 13, 2017. Within two months, the younger sister, aged 9, was also found hanging in her house on March 4, 2017. Both of them belonged to Scheduled Caste community. As per the postmortem reports, both the girls were subjected to sexual assault. The autopsy report in the case of the younger girl even suggested the possibility of homicidal hanging. The police however did not explore the angle of murder, and final report was submitted against four accused тАУ V Madhu, M Madhu, Shibu and Pradeep Kumar- for offences of abetment of suicide, rape and unnatural sex under the Indian Penal Code and penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act. There is one more accused, who is a juvenile and proceedings against him are progressing in the Juvenile Justice Board. The Special POCSO Court, Palakkad had acquitted one of the accused Pradeep Kumar on September 30. The other three accused were acquitted by the Special Court on October 25. The acquittals in this case have jolted the society, with complaints arising from several quarters that the probe in the case was deliberately sabotaged. The appointment of Advocate N Rajesh, who appeared for the accused in the case for long time, as the Chairman of the Child Welfare Committee during the pendency of the trial added to the controversy. It was only after his appointment as CWC Chairman that he relinquished the brief of the accused in the case. Rajesh was removed as the CWC Chairman on Monday following the furore. The case got echoed in the Kerala Legislative Assembly on Monday with the opposition highlighting the lapses in investigation and prosecution. The Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated in the floor of the assembly that the government will examine if there are any such lapses and will decide on the need for a re-investigation or CBI probe. The government would appeal against the verdict and seek the services of an experienced lawyer, the CM added. While the copy of the judgment acquitting three accused on October 25 is awaited, the judgment dated September 30 which acquitted Pradeep Kumar has been released. A look at the judgment will reveal that the case was built on weak evidence. тАЬI have no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the alleged offences against the accused beyond reasonable doubtтАЭ, observed Judge Muralee Krishna S, 1st Additional Sesssions Judge, Palakkad, in the judgment acquitting Pradeep Kumar. The case was completely based on circumstantial evidence. The Court observed that the police had no case that the girl had died other than by way of suicide. тАЬNeither the prosecution nor the defence has a case during evidence that the girl died not by committing suicideтАЭ, the Court said. No direct evidence of sexual abuse Pradeep Kumar was residing in a rented house about 100 meters away from the girlsтАЩ family. It was established in trial that he used to give tuition classes to the girl at his home. The sexual abuse of the girl by Pradeep Kumar was sought to be proved through the depositions of three young women who were examined as Prosecution Witnesses 9, 10 and 12. They told the Court that the elder sister confided in them that Pradeep Kumar had exhibited his nudity to her. The witnesses stated that the victim had became scared and perplexed when she encountered Pradeep Kumar on way. PW12 added that the girl told her that the accused had once locked her in a room and asked her to click his nude pictures from his mobile phone. The Court however disbelieved their statements based on contradictions regarding the timing of the girlтАЩs statements about the accused. In fact, two of them тАУ PW9 and 11 тАУ had turned hostile during trial. According to PW9, the girl told about the accused when they were out together for canvassing votes for legislative assembly elections. PW10 said that the statements were made by the girl when they were canvassing for a student political organization. As per PW12, her mother was contesting in the Panchayat elections and the victim girl had accompanied her for election work. The statements about the accused were made then, PW12 said. тАЬThis contradiction in the depositions of these witnesses is sufficient to doubt the genuineness of the depositionsтАЭ, the Court said. The Court also noted that the statements made by PW12 regarding the accused giving the deceased a mobile phone to click his nude photos were not found in her statement given to the police under Section 161 CrPC. This omission was treated as a material contradiction by the Court. In this regard, the Court referred to the precedent laid down by SC in Subhash v State of Haryana which stated that a significant omission made by a witness in the statement given to police under Section 161 can amount to a contradiction. Also, as per PW12тАЩs statement, the victim girl told about the accused during Panchayat election work, which took place in 2015. However, the accused started residing near the victimтАЩs house only from January 2016. From this, the Court concluded that PW9, 10 and 12 were тАЬplanted witnessesтАЭ who were тАЬdeposing falsehood before the Court with a view to help the prosecutionтАЭ. The parents of the girl had not given any statement of witnessing her being subjected to sexual assault by Pradeep Kumar. Their evidence was only based on hearsay from PW9, 10 and 12. No scientific evidence: The judgment noted that scientific evidence was lacking in the case. тАЬno semen or spermatozoa could be collected either from the specimen collected from the deceased girl or from the dresses of the accused. There is absolute absence of scientific evidence to connect the accused with the alleged offence.тАЭ Another crucial factor which tilted the balance in favour of the accused was the statement given by the Dr Priyatha, the forensic surgeon who conducted the post mortem of the girl, during cross examination that the anal injuries of the girl could be due to piles infection. Based on this, the Court held that there was no conclusive proof that the girl was subjected to anal penetration. тАЬPW11, the Assistant Surgeon of Forensic Department who conducted the post mortem examination though opined that the injuries noted in the anal canal of the girl could be due to anal penetration, she gave an alternative opinion also to the effect that it could be the result of an infection in the region. The opinion given by the doctor after post mortem examination is not the conclusive proof to say that the girl was subjected to anal penetration. An expert evidence can be used only for the purpose of corroboration. In this case, there is absence of substantive evidence to be corroborated by the opinion evidence given by PW11. More over, her deposition itself shows that an alternative opinion of infection in the anal region of the girl was also given by this expertтАЭ. The Court also observed that there was force in the argument of the defence that the statements of the witnesses were manipulated by the investigating officer after taking the accused into custody. Further, the Court discarded the facts projected by the prosecution to show discovery of information pursuant to confessional statement of the accused as per Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The prosecution stated that the place of commission of offence was told to the police by the accused. Further, the prosecution stated that the clothes worn by the accused at the time of offence were also shown to police by him. But the Court said that in order to accept the confessional statement under Section 27, the facts discovered should be within the exclusive knowledge of the accused. Here, the the statements of PW9, 10 and 12 had mentioned about the alleged place of crime even before the confession of the accused. Also, there was no scientific or other evidence to show that the clothes claimed to have been discovered based on the confession of the accused were the ones which were worn by him at the time of crime. тАЬHence the alleged disclosure statement of the accused is also not helpful for the prosecutionтАЭ, observed the Court in this regard. The Court said that in the entire chain of circumstances only two circumstances could be proved by the prosecution. One, the accused had been residing near the house of the victim in a rented house. Two, the accused had an opportunity to commit an offence against the victim girl when she had visited his house either for playing or for obtaining tuition. тАЬBut there is absence of any other circumstance to link the accused with the commission of the alleged offenceтАЭ, the Court held while acquitting Pradeep Kumar of offences under Section 376(2) (i) and (n), 377, 305 and 354 of IPC and Section 5(1) read with 6 and Section 7 read with 8 of POCSO Act and Sections 3(1)(w)(i) and 3(2)(v)(a) of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

The Court also noted that the statements made by PW12 regarding the accused giving the deceased a mobile phone to click his nude photos were not found in her statement given to the police under Section 161 CrPC. This omission was treated as a material contradiction by the Court. In this regard, the Court referred to the precedent laid down by SC in Subhash v State of Haryana which stated that a significant omission made by a witness in the statement given to police under Section 161 can amount to a contradiction. Also, as per PW12тАЩs statement, the victim girl told about the accused during Panchayat election work, which took place in 2015. However, the accused started residing near the victimтАЩs house only from January 2016. From this, the Court concluded that PW9, 10 and 12 were тАЬplanted witnessesтАЭ who were тАЬdeposing falsehood before the Court with a view to help the prosecutionтАЭ. The parents of the girl had not given any statement of witnessing her being subjected to sexual assault by Pradeep Kumar. Their evidence was only based on hearsay from PW9, 10 and 12. No scientific evidence: The judgment noted that scientific evidence was lacking in the case. тАЬno semen or spermatozoa could be collected either from the specimen collected from the deceased girl or from the dresses of the accused. There is absolute absence of scientific evidence to connect the accused with the alleged offence.тАЭ Another crucial factor which tilted the balance in favour of the accused was the statement given by the Dr Priyatha, the forensic surgeon who conducted the post mortem of the girl, during cross examination that the anal injuries of the girl could be due to piles infection. Based on this, the Court held that there was no conclusive proof that the girl was subjected to anal penetration. тАЬPW11, the Assistant Surgeon of Forensic Department who conducted the post mortem examination though opined that the injuries noted in the anal canal of the girl could be due to anal penetration, she gave an alternative opinion also to the effect that it could be the result of an infection in the region. The opinion given by the doctor after post mortem examination is not the conclusive proof to say that the girl was subjected to anal penetration. An expert evidence can be used only for the purpose of corroboration. In this case, there is absence of substantive evidence to be corroborated by the opinion evidence given by PW11. More over, her deposition itself shows that an alternative opinion of infection in the anal region of the girl was also given by this expertтАЭ. The Court also observed that there was force in the argument of the defence that the statements of the witnesses were manipulated by the investigating officer after taking the accused into custody. Further, the Court discarded the facts projected by the prosecution to show discovery of information pursuant to confessional statement of the accused as per Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The prosecution stated that the place of commission of offence was told to the police by the accused. Further, the prosecution stated that the clothes worn by the accused at the time of offence were also shown to police by him. But the Court said that in order to accept the confessional statement under Section 27, the facts discovered should be within the exclusive knowledge of the accused. Here, the the statements of PW9, 10 and 12 had mentioned about the alleged place of crime even before the confession of the accused. Also, there was no scientific or other evidence to show that the clothes claimed to have been discovered based on the confession of the accused were the ones which were worn by him at the time of crime. тАЬHence the alleged disclosure statement of the accused is also not helpful for the prosecutionтАЭ, observed the Court in this regard. The Court said that in the entire chain of circumstances only two circumstances could be proved by the prosecution. One, the accused had been residing near the house of the victim in a rented house. Two, the accused had an opportunity to commit an offence against the victim girl when she had visited his house either for playing or for obtaining tuition. тАЬBut there is absence of any other circumstance to link the accused with the commission of the alleged offenceтАЭ, the Court held while acquitting Pradeep Kumar of offences under Section 376(2) (i) and (n), 377, 305 and 354 of IPC and Section 5(1) read with 6 and Section 7 read with 8 of POCSO Act and Sections 3(1)(w)(i) and 3(2)(v)(a) of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.","IND","dalit",1,3,NA,NA

While the Ahmedabad Municipal Servants' Association (AMSA), the apex body of sanitation workers in the city, claimed their one-day ""strike"" to be successful, a senior civic official said that normal work was not affected. ""Not everyone was absent during today's strike. Many workers came for their work in the morning and left after giving a memorandum. It can not be termed as a full-fledged strike. Since our work was not hampered, we haven't made any alternative arrangements,"" said Deputy Municipal Commissioner CR Kharsan. AMSA general secretary Kalpesh Makwana claimed all the 20,000-odd workers didn't attend their work. A memorandum was also handed over to district collector seeking justice for the Hathras victim, he said. Workers from Jamnagar and some other towns from Saurashtra region also reportedly abstained from work.

Consoling the victimтАЩs mother, Priyanka Gandhi, who serves the party as General Secretary for Eastern UP, said that she and her party (Congress) will together stand strong in the face of injustice against the family. тАЬThe family couldnтАЩt see their daughter for the one last time. UP CM Yogi Adityanath should understand his responsibility. Till the time justice is delivered, weтАЩll continue this fight,тАЭ a report by Hindustan Times quoted her as saying after meeting the family. Rahul Gandhi said that the government of UP must protect the grieving family. тАЬI stand with the family. It is the responsibility of the state government to ensure their safety,тАЭ he said. The leaders stayed with the family for over an hour after they reached Hathras around 6: 45pm following a series of dramatic events, including their detainment by the UP Police on Thursday on grounds of violating Section 144 and the pandemic law. On this afternoon, amid the restrictions, both the Congress leaders were stopped while on their way to Hathras. Reports said that Vadra played the role of protector during a brief clash between Congress workers and Uttar Pradesh cops at the toll plaza on the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyover, as the workers were not being allowed to move ahead. In a video story published by NDTV, Vadra can be seen hopping a small yellow barricade and rushing to shield a man in a white kurta as cops with raised lathis surround her and a horde of reporters cover the ruckus. Despite the huge chaos Vadra can be seen standing resolutely between the man, who appeared to be injured, and the police, despite considerable pushing and shoving, helping him to sit down by the side of the road and standing by his side. Vadra and her brother, Rahul Gandhi, were at the toll plaza on the DND to make a second attempt to travel to Hathras and meet the family of the victim. The Congress leadersтАЩ first attempt, on Thursday, ended in a tussle with cops who refused to let them pass, citing orders banning large gatherings amid coronavirus concerns, and shoving him to the ground in the chaos that followed. This time, though, facing severe criticism over its handling of the tragedy and the physical confrontation with Gandhi, the Yogi Adityanath led UP government backed down, allowing the Gandhis and two senior Congress leaders to proceed, the report said. This was hours after two top UP officials first met the family тАУ the first visit by high-ranking officials since the assault on September 14. The UP government had previously insisted that large gatherings тАУ such as those of the Congress delegation тАУ were not allowed in line with COVID management guidelines. These orders prohibit people from travelling in groups of more than five. The ruling BJP, is under pressure over its apparent inability to prevent horrific crimes against women and at least two more assaults and rapes have been reported from the state since then. Amid the curbs and demand by the opposition parties and social activists that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath must resign for not being able to manage the crisis, the CM made a declaration of his governmentтАЩs commitment on Friday. тАЬThose who even think of harming mothers and daughters in UP, their destruction is assured,тАЭ he tweeted in Hindi. In the meantime, the Chief Minister of UP Yogi Adityanath recommended Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case. On Friday, the CM had suspended Hathras superintendent of police Vikrant Vir and three other police officers for their handling of the case. Furious protests against the police and the government have been staged across the country, including one in Delhi on Friday, where Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made an appearance and demanded that the four accused, who are all from the so-called тАЬupper casteтАЭ, be executed. Meanwhile, the Allahabad High Court has taken notice of the case and has summoned top officials of the government and police to appear before it on October 12.  Free Press Kashmir is now on Telegram.

But in Tamil NaduтАЩs Kallakurichi, the wedding of 35-year-old All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) legislator A Prabhu to 19-year-old student S Soundarya took a dark turn when the brideтАЩs father turned up at the wedding venue and threatened to set himself on fire. The father, S Swaminathan, said he was opposed to the marriage because Prabhu had тАЬluredтАЭ his daughter into marriage, and had been grooming her since she was a minor.

In response to SwaminathanтАЩs allegations, Prabhu released a video where he is sitting next to Soundarya as he explains their joint decision to get married despite her familyтАЩs opposition. 36-yr-old Kallakurichi MLA Prabhu clarifies that neither did he kidnap nor force 19-yr-old Soundarya into marrying him.

Swaminathan, who is a temple priest, has denied that caste identity played any role in his opposition to Prabhu, a Dalit, marrying his daughter. In a Times of India report, Swaminathan said, тАЬThough we are Brahmins, for 14 years, Prabhu grew up in my house and I considered him my son. But he broke that trust.тАЭ He has now approached the court for a hearing in the matter. AIADMK Dalit MLA's inter-caste marriage stirs controversy as wife's family opposes.

On social media, many users have pointed out that the 17-year difference between the two is out of the ordinary. Though Prabhu has denied the claims that he was pursuing a relationship with Soundarya when she was a minor, not everybody is convinced. I'm really uncomfortable with the age gap though.

Arr├й Bench The Arr├й bench delivers stories that mattress. It hasn't achieved much sofar. But it's getting bedder.  Did you like it? Tell us what you think so we can give you more content you like : There are a slew of Instagram accounts run by media professionals dedicated to irritants and inside jokes of their job and industry. Lately, the conversation has slowly moved from the likes of тАЬThis client said this silly thingтАЭ to тАЬMy agency promotes mental health as long as it involves a yoga class, not reasonable work hours or manageable workloads. Haha. Fun.тАЭ This shift from LOLs and low-key whining to simmering aggression about toxic work culture during the pandemic is an eye-opener. WeтАЩve all heard of Javed Khan, the rickshaw driver who sold his wifeтАЩs jewellery to convert his vehicle into a mobile ambulance. Though heartening, these tales of sacrifices make me gloomy. Each one of these positive stories come with the unsaid failure by the state or those in a better position to help. As the second wave continues to batter India, тАЬwokeтАЭ media organisations and ad agencies are all about well-being and mental health. The problem arises when this performance of empathy does not extend to their employees. Stories of bosses expecting you to work beyond office hours and making one demand after another on WhatsApp groups are all too common. There are several reasons why this second wave of the coronavirus may prove to be more lethal than the first one. Most of it has to do with Indian behavioural impulses. Indians havenтАЩt been able to stand in a queue for the longest of time and it comes as no surprise that the pandemic-taught etiquette has worn off.

Authors Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelkandan put light on how the various western bodies like the Church, Researchers and thinkers, Western government groups and organizations brought about a crisp distinction between the blurred identity of the Dravidians and the Dalit communities and also the other parts of the тАШthen IndiaтАЩ. Half a decade of research and information gathering from multiple reliable sources has finally led to the compilation of тАШBreaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit FaultlinesтАЩ. The researchers followed the trail left behind by the business groups, which are deceiving in nature and faulty in their sole claim of тАШgood workтАЩ. The book gives a clear perspective of the state of affairs in the varied organizations. Here are excerpts from the book: тАЬPrior to colonialism, the jati-varna system in India had little, if anything, to do with race, ethnicity, or genetics. It was better understood as a set of distinctions based on traditional or inherited social status derived from work roles. Jati is a highly localized and intricately organized social structure. One of the important aspects of jati, which was conspicuously overlooked by western Indologists, is its dynamic nature тАУ allowing social mobility as well as occupational diversification. These rural social structures were more horizontally organized than vertically stratified. It was this inherent feature of the jati-varna system that led Gandhi to postulate the model of тАШoceanic circleтАЩ for the ideal Indian village society, rather than the Western pyramidal model. Nevertheless, the colonial imposition of the hierarchical view, coupled with distortions of jati in order to fit it into a racial framework, grossly distorted the characteristics of jati and greatly amplified its negative features. Max M├╝ller, who was largely responsible for entrenching the racial framework for studying jati, had his own evangelical motive. In his view, caste:. . . which has hitherto proved an impediment to conversion of the Hindus, may in future became one of the most powerful engines for the conversion not merely of the individuals, but of whole classes of Indian society. Max M├╝llerтАЩs interpretation of the Rig Veda claimed that only the first three varnas are Aryan, while the fourth, shudra, is not Aryan. However, he explicitly admitted that there was no evidence of physical differences between Aryans and non-Aryans in Sanskrit texts. He made only one incidental reference to physical differences тАУ that noses were described differently for different tribes in the Rig Veda . He based this notion on a single Sanskrit word, anasa (Rig Veda : V.29.10), that was used infrequently. M├╝ller himself drew no important conclusions from this casual observation. But his prejudice was passed on through others who were more eager to do the dirty work openly. One of the common threads throughout the WestтАЩs study of India has been the manner in which subsequent scholars pick and choose from someone elseтАЩs work, often out of context, and with their own arbitrary assignment of priorities. This is what happened between Max M├╝llerтАЩs writing and its manipulative use by Risley years later. The younger Risley was greatly influenced by the senior and legendary figure of Max M├╝ller. The development of racist theories between these two men was an important step in shaping the future identities of people across India. Publicly, M├╝ller was cautious and wanted to protect his image, so he criticized the use of linguistics for racial profiling. But indirectly and privately, he encouraged it in various ways. For instance, M├╝ller gave the following input in a private letter to Risley, prior to RisleyтАЩs census of 1901: тАЬIt may be that in time the classification of skulls,hair, eyes, and skin may be brought into harmony with the classification of language. We may even go so far as to admit, as a postulate, that the two must have run parallel, at least in the beginning of all things.тАЭ In the same letter, he encouraged Risley by saying that students of ethnology have regarded тАШthe skull, as the shell of the brainтАЩ to be an indicator of тАШthe spiritual essenceтАЩ of the person. In other words, Max M├╝ller spoke from both sides of his mouth when it came to racial implications of cultural and linguistic factors. This ambiguity was often deliberately nuanced in codified terms, which enabled more blatantly racist men like Risley to proceed further. Ronald Inden has pointed out that Max M├╝llerтАЩs caution against conflating language with race was an act of hypocrisy: тАЬWe should not be misled by this into thinking that these scholars were anti-racist. They did not have to rely on a theory of race as such, for they had their own global theory that was fully able to inferiorize the languages (and by implication the cultures) of the other purely on linguistic grounds. Max M├╝llerтАЩs linguistic taxonomy was a Hegelian hierarchy in which . . . cultural geography [becomes] the same as world history.тАЭ (This book is available at https://www.hindueshop.com/product/breaking-india/) Lautenberg Amendment 1990 United States had a program starting in 1990s with lot of similaritiesтАж Your email address will not be published.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has written a letter to CongressтАЩ interim chief Sonia Gandhi in this regard, asking her to take action against Kamal Nath. Notably, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath made the controversial remark on Sunday during campaigning for the upcoming bypolls. While speaking in Gwalior districtтАЩs Dabra segment, Kamal Nath had allegedly called Imarti Devi an 'item'. Notably, bye-elections for 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats will take place on November 3 and the counting of votes will occur on November 10. In the letter, Chouhan mentioned that he thought Sonia Gandhi would not only condemn her party leaderтАЩs statement over a Dalit woman but also take a strict action against him. тАЬBut you have not done anything like this so far,тАЭ wrote Chouhan. The senior BJP leader also said that despite the fact that Kamal NathтАЩs remarks are being slammed by the media across the country, the Congress leader is defending his тАЬindecentтАЭ and тАЬcondemnableтАЭ remark. Taking note of Imrati DeviтАЩs тАШtearfulтАЩ response to Kamal NathтАЩs statement, Chouhan added that тАЬdisrespecting a Dalit woman like this tarnishes your politicsтАЭ. тАЬRemove Kamal Nath immediately from all party posts and condemn his statement strongly.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on a silent fast (protest) for two hours in Bhopal earlier today to protest against NathтАЩs statement. Later, the MP CM said: тАЬMadam Sonia Gandhi, a leader of your party, a former CM has made such a comment. Is it okay? Do poor women have no respect? Madam, if you think the remark was wrong, what action will you take? I'm writing to you, you make a decision.тАЭ Chouhan also accused Kamal Nath of crossing тАЬlimits of shamelessnessтАЭ. тАЬI expected a clarification, but the statement is being shamelessly justified. You can abuse me, call me names, but such a comment about a woman is against every daughter & mother. Women have been disrespected during Navratri.

And to set up an international enquiry into the Hathras rape case and other rapes and crimes against women, particularly Dalit and oppressed caste women in UP since the Yogi government came to power in the state. The full text and signatories are below: To the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet Dear Ms Bachelet, We are writing to you to express our deep sense of shock and dismay at the terrible events unfolding in Uttar Pradesh, India and to urge you to take action as outlined below. Recent events On 14th September a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and assaulted with inhuman violence in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Her spine was broken, paralysing all her limbs, her body grievously bruised and her tongue was brutally wounded. The four men who had raped and assaulted her were oppressor caste Thakurs who dominated the village she lived in тАУ a place which continues to practice тАШuntouchabilityтАЩ. They had allegedly been ruthlessly harassing her for a considerable length of time, to the extent that she was afraid of leaving her home. But worse was to come. The UP police, initially reluctant to register a case against the four accused, left her lying on the concrete floor of the police station and when she was eventually taken to a hospital she was left in a generic ward. Only after pressure built up was she transferred to the ICU and later to DelhiтАЩs Safdarjung Hospital, where she passed away on 29th September. But even this scale of cruelty was not enough for the police and administration of UP and the local government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath which gave them their orders. On the night of 30th September, they took away her dead body. Her motherтАЩs pleas to be allowed one last look at her were ignored. Then, barricading her family in their house so they could not attend or perform funeral rites, the police forcibly and hurriedly cremated her body at 2:30 am to erase all evidence in the case. Not isolated events What is most shocking is that far from being an isolated crime, this is part of a systematic attack on women and oppressed castes. Three other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victimтАЩs remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered тАУ rape is suspected тАУ and in Azamgarh an 8-year-old girl was raped. While attacks on Dalits and women have escalated vastly all over India since 2014, when the Hindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideology came to power, the Adityanath government in UP has seen by far the largest number of attacks and atrocities. For example, in 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to IndiaтАЩs annual National Crime Record BureauтАЩs тАЬCrime in IndiaтАЭ 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits тАУ 26% of all cases reported. We are deeply concerned about where this is leading India and more specifically the state of Uttar Pradesh. We hope you are able to take action: The signatories of the open letter are over 30 feminist groups, all the Dalit organisations in the UK and many other of the diaspora groups like CasteWatch UK, South Asia Solidarity Group, National Valmiki Sabha, NRI UK, London Black WomenтАЩs Project and several Ambedkar International Missions in different countries.

The hasty and forceful cremation of the victimтАЩs body by the Uttar Pradesh police has sent shock waves across India and indeed around the world.

A policeman has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh's Narsinghpur district for allegedly not registering a Dalit rape victim's complaint for four days, following which she ended her life, a top officer said on Saturday. The arrest was made after Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took serious cognisance of the alleged lapse and ordered that a case be registered against the local police official. Two senior officials were also shunted out as per the orders. The woman, who was allegedly raped by three men four days ago, died by suicide on Friday, police said. An official in Bhopal said that Chouhan had ordered on Friday night that Assistant Inspector of Police (ASI) Mishrilal Kodapa of Gotitoriya police outpost in Gadarwara tehsil, some 50 kms from Narsinghpur district headquarters, should be booked and arrested for not registering the victim's complaint of gang-rape. Besides, as per the orders, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Rajesh Tiwari and Gadarwara Sub Divisional Officer of Police (SDOP) S R Yadav were shunted out from Narsinghpur, he said. ""A case was registered against Kodapa and he was arrested under 166 (c) (public servant failing to record information) of IPC on Friday night,"" Jabalpur Zone Inspector General of Police Bhagwat Singh Chauhan told PTI. The ASP and the SDOP have been transferred from Narsinghpur, he added. Kodapa had been suspended on Friday after a video went viral in social media, in which the husband of the deceased woman accused the policeman of not registering a complaint of rape, police said. The man was purportedly heard saying in the audio- visual clip that instead of taking action in the case, he was held based on a complaint lodged by the accused and had to cough up Rs 50,000 as a bribe for his release. ""Three men identified as Arvind and Parsu Choudhary, who belonged to the same community as the victim, and another accused Anil Rai, allegedly gang-raped the 32-year old woman on Monday. They trio has been arrested,"" Narsinghpur SP Ajay Singh said. According to police, the accused allegedly raped the woman when she was in a field cutting grass for the cattle. The police, however, said on Friday that the woman's two nieces said that the accused caught hold of her and teased her, but did not confirm that she was raped. As per the girls' version, when they raised an alarm, the accused fled from the spot, police added. SDOP Yadav, who has been shunted out, had said on Friday that the woman and her husband had orally complained to the police on the same day but there was no clarity in the complaint. On Friday, when the victim went to fetch water from a tap, a local woman had allegedly taunted her, after which the victim returned home and hanged herself, police said. Police said they have have already arrested that woman. ""Besides, Motilal, Arvind's father, too, was arrested under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) as he had said something insulting to the woman,"" Yadav had said. After the Dalit woman hanged herself, the police registered a case of gang rape against the three accused on Friday after four days. This news piece may be triggering.

Worse, hurdles were created for those who seeking to give a supporting hand the family. The victim (identified by the team as Dasya), died in a Delhi hospital a fortnight later.The team, under the banner of the civil society network National Alliance of PeopleтАЩs Movements (NAPM), included NAPM convener Medha Patkar, academic and political activist Sandeep Pandey, Khudai Khitmadtar convener Faisal Khan, Supreme Court advocate Ehtesham Hashmi, and Delhi Solidarity Group representatives Joe Athialy and Amit Kumar.The team, which met the family members of Dasya, belonging to the Dalit Valimiki community, found that accused are from the influential Thakur caste, which dominated in the village, Bulgarhi, was receiving support from powerful circles. Thus, on visiting the village at around 1 pm on October 9, the team members had to not just тАЬpass through the police cordon and barricadesтАЭ, but were stopped and told that no тАЬmore than five members can go together to meet the victimтАЩs family.тАЭWhile the team was allowed in after writing applications addressed to the sub-divisional magistrate in a two team of two 5 and 4, it was witness to a second team, consisting of тАЬsaffron turban clad Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha activistsтАЭ with posters stuck on their vehicles with the message written that they were there only to meet the тАШvictimтАЩ Thakur family.тАЬThey were about ten to twelve people. They argued with police to go together and after much debate they were allowed to go together inside the villageтАЭ, the report said.According to the report, Bulgarhi, a village with more than 600 families, and just about 15 Dalit families, which has experienced тАЬa number of repressive acts and atmosphere over decadesтАЭ. Thus, DasyaтАЩs family was allotted 5 bighas of land by MayawatiтАЩs government in 1990s. тАЬHowever, till today, they are in physical possession of only three and half bighas while the rest is apparently encroached upon by some Brahmin familyтАЭ, it added.Pointing towards how, after the gangrape, Dasya was brought to the Balga Hospital in an unconscious state, the report said, тАЬThe doctors were not briefed by police nor did any policeman or official did any investigation as per all the family members, DasyaтАЩs mother, brother, father, sister-in-law (bhabhi) and bhabhiтАЩs brotherтАЭ, which is тАЬabsolutely necessary under section 375 of IPC.тАЭтАЬAlmost nothing happened in 24 hours and she was shifted to an Aligarh hospital, when she was still almost unconscious. Her tongue was bitten and broken, not allowing her to speak a word. It was in the Aligarh hospital, the relatives heard, the doctors exclaiming that they didnтАЩt know from where had the case been brought to them and for whatтАЭ, the report said.In fact, according to the report, at Aligarh, тАЬthe family since the beginning felt that the doctors and employees were under enormous pressure.тАЭ, However, тАЬthey did give basic treatmentтАЭ, which led to Dasya becoming тАЬa little consciousness for some time after a day or two and narrated her story to her mother, taking names of the four culprits, referring to rape and brutal assault.тАЭThe report said, only when the family members, frustrated at the way things were going on, decided to speak out, and called the doctors, sisters, and relative of other patients present in the ward that the тАЬreality came into the public domain.тАЭ This happened when тАЬthe whole systemic force was active around them with no space to manoeuvre, nor much support.тАЭThus, the doctors at Aligarh, тАЬwho must have checked her whole body, didnтАЩt examine anything related to sexual assault, nor did they enquire with her family till she herself brought out the truth.тАЬThis passage, rather wastage, of time could be deliberate since late examination couldnтАЩt ever prove rape. The intention obviously could be to miss or lose evidence foreverтАЭ, the report alleged. The result was, if the medico legal case report mentions penetration of vagina by penis, while the report from the forensic department тАЬrules out this possibility.тАЭ Thakur supporters of accused were 10 to 12 people. They argued with police to go together. They were allowed to go together inside the villageA similar treatment continued with DasyaтАЩs family after she was shifted to Delhi, and admitted to the Safdarjung hospital. Here, said the report, Dasya family was told she was in ICU, тАЬbut there was no one to explain them, console them and they didnтАЩt hear about the police investigation while they were much harassed, with questions asked; with no answers given to their queries.тАЭhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/EKbnSv_KYEE In fact, said the report, тАЬThe family remembered how DasyaтАЩs father was called to the district magistrate in Hathras and questioned about the incidence. More than listening to his replies, an unclear message given to him on the very next day of the incidence that he and the family should convey to all about their being satisfied with the enquiry and the treatment both. This itself conveys the state was preparing to suppress the truth and close the case forever.тАЭтАЬAt the Safdarjung hospital, when Dasya succumbed to her injuries, all the family members sitting outside were simply informed by the police and made to face utter distress, grief and pain. Their consent was sought for post mortem process, but nothing else was sharedтАЭ, the report said, adding, they were only called to show the body put inside the mortuary.тАЬNone realised that the body in the hands of the administration, wherever stored, was unsafeтАЭ, the report said, adding, тАЬThe shocking news a few hours later was that the police had taken away the body for cremation, without seeking their consent or opinion. The police sent the family in a van to Hathras but stopped the vehicle away from the cremation ground. The women vehemently cried and tried to stop and knock at the police vans but in vain.тАЭHurdles were put on those who tried to support the family. While it has been widely reported how Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were sought to be stopped from visiting Hathras, Dalit community leaders have had to face a worse ordeal.Thus, the report said, Shyoraj Jivan, a staunch defender of Dalit rights and a leading activist from Valmiki community to which the Dalit family belonga, came to not just meet, console and give immediate support, but also to be active in the long-term legal battle.Jivan got furious to hear the story and the history, the report said, adding, he spoke out in anguish and anger and made a statement to some media in the same mood that if anyone happens to look at Dalit girls with wrong intention, his eyes would be popped out.This made the Uttar Pradesh police arrest him, and is still in jail, and DasyaтАЩs family members тАЬfeel that their only supporter from Valmiki community, to which they belong, is kept away as a conspiracy.тАЭYet another supporter, Dr Jyoti Bansal, an Ambedkarite, who reached out to Hathras and console as well as strengthen DasyaтАЩs familyтАЩs to stand up and fight for justice, was declared a Naxalite. The report quotes DasyaтАЩs bhabhi as telling the NAPM team: тАЬWhen she spoke to Babuji (father), he felt highly consoled. We could find him interacting with her and coming out of depression to an extent. We, therefore, requested her to stay back and she did.тАЭThe babhi added, Dr Bansal тАЬstayed for the second night on our insistence and changed the atmosphere in the hours, in spite of a large police force surrounding us for 24├Ч7 and outsiders continuing to visit and question. When these are the facts, we feel sad that she is blamed as a Naxal.тАЭ Kamayani Bali тАУ Mahabal тАУ A Kractivist with Multiple Personality Disorder ( MPD) which encompasses a clinical psychologist, journalist, lawyer and activist.

Don't miss out on the latest News Bijay Kumar Minj, New Delhi Updated: October 15, 2020 09:32 AM GMT Dalit Christians and activists from across India protest in New Delhi on Aug. 10, 2019, demanding that the government give them the same rights as enjoyed by their Hindu counterparts. (Photo: Bijay Kumar Minj/UCA News)  Police in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have arrested a man suspected to have thrown acid on three Dalit minor sisters in Gonda city. Ashish Chaurasiya was arrested after a brief exchange of fire with police on Oct. 13, police said on Oct. 14. However, the suspectтАЩs mother Laxmi said her son was framed by police and has demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Chaurasiya was arrested after soon after Yogi Adityanath, the stateтАЩs chief minister, called for tough action against those responsible for the acid attack. The sisters, aged 8, 12 and 17, were attacked while they were sleeping. While two received minor burn injuries, one has more serious injuries on her face. They are all stable in hospital. тАЬLast monthтАЩs gang rape of a Dalit girl in the state who later died was not even forgotten and now more Dalit girls have been attacked. Very unfortunate and highly condemnable. It is a cruel and inhuman act,тАЭ Father Vijay Kumar Nayak, secretary of the Indian bishopsтАЩ office for Dalits and lower classes, told UCA News. тАЬThere are several reasons why all of sudden we are hearing the news of atrocities on people of Dalit origin. The main reason is their socioeconomic condition because the accused person knows that Dalits cannot revolt.тАЭ Father Nayak said Dalits are always on the receiving end of mistreatment from other people and the government. тАЬPeople take them for granted that they are here to be suppressed, which is very dangerous for a democratic country like India,тАЭ the priest said. тАЬThere is a trend that if you attack Dalits you will become famous among your community. Another threat is that people who support Dalits and minorities are targeted by so-called elite groups who brand them as anti-national.тАЭ Attacks on Dalits have been common in India recently. In July, the tonsure of Vara Prasad by police in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh state became national news with even the president of India taking note of it. Also in July, Dalit youth Yericharla Kiran died in police custody in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh after he was detained for not wearing a face mask. In neighboring Tamil Nadu state, a 63-year-old Dalit father and his 31-year-old son died in police custody in June. Mukti Prakash Tirkey, editor of a weekly newspaper in New Delhi, said there is no fear among people about breaking the law in cases involving Dalits, tribal people and minorities. тАЬUnless the mentality of people changes towards their fellow brethren that in front of the law we all are equal and all Indians are my brothers and sisters, we can hear the news of Dalit and tribal atrocities every other day,тАЭ the human rights activist said. Dalits, or untouchables, are the lowest caste within Hindu society. Huge numbers of Dalits have converted to Christianity and Islam over the decades, though in reality the religions offer limited protection from societal prejudice. The word Dalit means ""trampled upon"" in Sanskrit and refers to all groups once considered untouchable and outside the four-tier Hindu caste system. Government data shows 201 million of IndiaтАЩs 1.2 billion people belong to this socially deprived group. Some 60 percent of India's 25 million Christians are of Dalit and tribal origin.

To do so they link dalit protests to Naxalite (Maoist) movement dubbing protesters as `traitorsтАЩ. The police rounded up even professors, poets and lawyers who wanted to participate in anniversary to celebrate Bhim Koregaon victory on December 31, 2019. A case in point is arrest of five prominent left-wing activists, dubbed `urban NaxalsтАЩ, and accused of funding the dalit protests. They were even accused of being linked to terrorists in illegally occupied Indian Jammu and Kashmir State. The arrestees are writer-poet P. Varavar Rao, lawyers Sudha Bhardwaj, Arun Fareira, Vernon Gonzaleves and Gotam Navalakha. The Koregaon Victory celebrations irked the high-caste Hindu as it aimed at commemorating the British victory (January 1, 1818) against Baji Rao Peshwa, a Maratha, by the dalit recruited in British army. The dalit had earlier asked the Peshwa to recruit them for fighting against the British army. But the Peshwa contemptuously rejected the request.

At a ceremony, five thousand dalit converted en masse to Budhism. A cursory look at oppression of the dalit during the past few years confirms that the dalit are treated as worse than animals in the Hindu society. The law enforcement agencies (police and judiciary) always support the high-caste culprits if a first information report is registered.

An altercation between rival groups led to stampede. Instead of resolving the matter amicably, the police opened fire on dalit congregation, killing two dalit on the spot and injuring several others.

"847",7359,"https://thewire.in/politics/lalu-yadav-bihar-elections-tejashwi-yadav","'Why Is Dalit Assertion Called Jungle Raj and Upper Caste Rule Mangal Raj?'","Three men from Bihar discuss the state of local politics with The Wire as the election to the state assembly nears a close. Voters stand in long queues to cast their votes at a polling station during the second phase of Assembly elections at Diyara in Danapur, Tuesday, November 3, 2020. Photo: PTI As phase three of the Bihar assembly election draws near, opposition leader Tejashwi YadavтАЩs public image, allegations of misrule or тАШjungle rajтАЩ under his father Lalu Yadav, the question of caste assertion and minority issues take centre-stage for the final time. Senior editor Arfa Khanum Sherwani discussed all this and more in a conversation with senior journalist Satish K. Singh, professors Ratan Lal from the University of Delhi and Rizwan Kaiser from Jamia Millia Islamia University. The full transcript of their chat is given below. It has been prepared and translated from the Hindi original by Zobia Salam. ┬з Arfa Khanum Sherwani: Hello! Welcome to The Wire, I am Arfa Khanum Sherwani. Phase one of the Bihar elections has ended, two phases remain. The conjecture, however, that has remained constant is over Tejashwi YadavтАЩs rallies drawing massive crowds. Is this an indication of not just a change in power dynamics but social change too? At the same time, however, there is a constant talk of тАШJungle Raj (era of misrule)тАЩ, with the prime minister himself dubbing Tejashwi Yadav as the тАШprince of Jungle Raj (prince of the era of misrule)тАЩ тАУ тАШJungle Raj ka YuvraajтАЩ. While he [Tejashwi Yadav] responded in a very dignified manner, a lot of people continue to ask if Tejashwi Yadav will be completely different from Lalu Yadav? Some people go so far to say that they accept Tejashwi Yadav if he comes [to power] тАШminus Lalu YadavтАЩ, sans Lalu Yadav. If he leaves his father home; that they might vote for him if steps away from under his [Lalu YadavтАЩs] influence. There is a curiosity about тАШJungle RajтАЩ. What was it really? Why was it called so? Is it solely a term in savarna discussions, that as long as upper-castes hold power it is тАШMangal RajтАЩ or тАШera of good ruleтАЩ or тАШRam Rajya (rule of Lord Rama)тАЩ while lower-caste politics is labelled тАШJungle RajтАЩ? In todayтАЩs programme, we will try to understand all this since it will tell us about the kind of government it will be if Tejashwi Yadav were to form a government. What kind of a chief minister will he be? Will he be Lalu YadavтАЩs son or has he made his own brand? Is it even possible for him to leave Lalu YadavтАЩs legacy behind? Is it even sensible to do so, given Lalu YadavтАЩs term and his struggle is the foundation upon which Tejashwi Yadav dreams of becoming BiharтАЩs chief minister? LetтАЩs talk about this. To talk about this important issue, I have three special guests тАУ a kind of a dream panel for this topic тАУ Satish K Singh, senior journalist, who has been part of the history of TV news. He has built and developed several channels тАУ from Zee News to NDTV India. My second guest is Dr Ratan Lal, a professor at the University of Delhi, who is considered an authority on the topic of Dalit politics. Professor Rizwan Kaiser is also present. He is a professor of History at Jamia Millia Islamia and a well-known face on TV, who has looked at history from a different perspective. If one is ever stuck, one often read Rizwan KaiserтАЩs work, his opinions on issues.  A warm welcome to all three guests. The key point in this discussion is their [guests] background! Which is from Bihar. So, today, I have three authentic Biharis present with us. AKS: First of all, Professor Ratan Lal, I would like to know from you. What is this constant тАШintrigueтАЩ? Just what was this тАШJungle RajтАЩ that it is being used to scare people even today? What even is this тАШJungle RajтАЩ? Ratan Lal: If a woman is living her life on her own will, they consider it тАШJungle RajтАЩ! The entire concept behind it has to be understood. The whole idea comes from the Puranas. DonтАЩt they say тАШkalyug has arrivedтАЩ? What is kalyug after all? There should be a debate on it. Kalyug refers to the destruction of varnashrama dharma тАУ caste-based religious order. Kalyug implies a destruction, a backlash against caste system. When the caste system gets destroyed, questions are raised. It is either called kalyug or тАШJungle RajтАЩ/тАШera of misruleтАЩ. Also read: Nitish Kumar Once Had the Power to Unite BiharтАЩs Women Voters тАУ But No Longer What is disappointing is that the various secular alliances and the Mahagathbandhan or Grand Alliance that have been formed have never included [stands on] secularism, social justice or even privatisation in their agenda. To the ones who are calling it [Lalu YadavтАЩs term] тАШJungle RajтАЩ and to the spokespersons of the Mahagathbandhan/Grand Alliance, I ask: why arenтАЩt you defending it? Before the 90s, was it тАШMangal RajтАЩ in Bihar? Was it as pure as the Ganga, with people worshipping in it? Were Dalits, Brahmans, women living equally? Or were shots being fired inside colleges? People were entering hostels and firing shots. Colleges were divided as per caste; I have studied there myself! In Muzaffarpur, in MotahariтАжwe have seen it! No one dared to speak. So, this [is a] dominant narrative. Dominant section prepares a narrative. The sad part is that RJD spokespersons and the people of the Grand Alliance are so intellectually bankrupt that theyтАЩre unable to defend even Lalu YadavтАЩs rule! What can one say then? Fine, there may be a law and order problem, but is it any less in Uttar Pradesh? Narendra Modi тАУ in Gujarat, during the [2002 Godhra riots/Naroda Patiya] massacre about whom the [then] Prime Minister [Atal Bihari Vajpayee] had said that тАШ[he has] not followed raj dharmaтАЩ тАУ is now in Bihar calling it [Lalu YadavтАЩs term] Jungle Raj. Why is there no question in Gujarat, which saw a massacre? For the past five years we have been out on the streets, resisting. You are killing Muslims [and] Dalits, at times in the name of beef, at times on something else. Go and see in Uttar Pradesh just how many are getting killed. What kind of a raj/rule should this be called? AKS: But Dr Ratan Lal, if this was such a good era then why doesnтАЩt Tejashwi Yadav put up posters and pictures of Lalu Yadav? When asked about тАШJungle RajтАЩ, why does he say it [his term] wonтАЩt be like that? RL: This has to be answered by Tejashwi Yadav or their [RJDтАЩs] spokespersons. If I have to writeтАжI have read the history of post-Independence Bihar. I have even written an essayтАж I have witnessed caste oppression. Satish [K. Singh] sir and Rizwan [Kaiser] sahib may stop me if IтАЩm wrong when I say that in the past, they [upper castes/dominant castes] could herd an entire Dalit village just with one stick! A lone boy could shout тАШget out!тАЩ and entire villages of Dalits could be chased away! Guns are being fired. You need to look at the process of social change. The revolution is not born in a day. I have seen Bihar, North India closely тАУ as a teacher, as a reformer [and] as a journalist too! I have seen this, travelling from one village to the other. I too have worked in journalism; written an essay, an essay on diversity. Just with one stick, they used to chase away entire villages of Dalits. What type of rule was that? Narendra Modi and Yogi [Adityanath] should answer. AKS: Satishji, would Dalit assertion be called тАШJungle RajтАЩ? And is savarna suzerainty over society, politics, wealth, [and] power тАШMangal RajтАЩ? Satish K. Singh: Just because something is right doesnтАЩt make another thing wrong. I would say that the notion of a тАШJungle RajтАЩтАжif the Dalit assertion or the backward caste assertion that emerged, turns into kidnappings [and] extortionтАжand in that if 5-10 peopleтАжif a particular caste gains [dominance]тАжperhaps that has been termed тАШJungle RajтАЩ by the political opportunists. But you cannot deny that the backwards, OBCs and DalitsтАжif you talk about them in the mainstream тАУ and while I agree with what Dr. Ratan Lal is saying, that they could chase away entire villages by brandishing just one stickтАжbut if that is converted into a rule of goons, it is more treacherous! Girls were kidnapped in broad daylight. Schools and colleges were in such a bad condition. I belong to that area; I can testify personally. You may call this тАШassertionтАЩ, but what does a person like me have to do with all this! Even I could not leave my village after 6-7 pm. What kind of an assertion is this? The only aspect of тАШassertionтАЩ is that a process existed to everything. Would anyone say that MNREGA is wrong, even though itтАЩs a relief measure, welfare, a compulsion even? No one would say that the Right to Food shouldnтАЩt have been granted. This too had a process. It is a matter of process that you have been given a toilet, a roof over your head, a house тАУ this too is part of a larger processтАж Also read: Bihar Elections Phase 2: Does Tejashwi Yadav Have the Edge? тАжOn the argument that тАШJungle RajтАЩ existed even before the 90s, I agree with Dr Ratan Lal. Very much so! But if that is corrupted, it is more treacherous. You tell me this: In 15 years, if 70 thousand jobs were to being givenтАжduring liberalisation, when governments were downsizing everywhere, how will there be any assertion? If you wonтАЩt give jobs, how will there be any [assertion]? In the 15 years that political opponents term тАШJungle RajтАЩ, 70 thousand jobs were given. I say, at least 70 lakh shouldтАЩve been given. AKS: Rizwan Kaiser sahib, you just heard the experiences of the two panellists. True, the worlds that we come from, the lives we have lived shapes our views. But it seems as if тАУ if you look at the map of Indian politicsтАжthe terrifying stories that are told about those 15 years тАУ I have read those too. I may not have lived through it but I think and understand тАУ having looked at backward-caste politics not just as a journalist; IтАЩve done a PhD on it too. Nonetheless, I cannot live the experience of a Dalit or backward-caste person living in Bihar. So, I would like to know from you. You, too, come from Bihar. You are situated outside that caste system. As a historian; as a person who belongs to Bihar but has nothing to do with the caste system, how do you see it? Would you term it тАШJungle RajтАЩ or not? Rizwan Kaiser: I think what Ratan Lal ji and Satish Singh ji said was from their individual perspectives. But [on] this notion of тАШJungle RajтАЩ тАУ for those of us who want to analyse all these issues тАУ as a student of history, I would say that we have to record everything: good, bad, best [and] worst. Arfa I would like to tell you тАУ Ratan Lal ji is younger than me, Satish ji might be the same age so he might recall тАУ Karpoori Thakur jiтАЩs arrival in 1977. And the process of reservation that Karpoori Thakur started anew, wherein the weakest section within the OBC would be given more benefits. There used to be a savarna slogan in those times, which I would like to remind everyone of тАУ тАШ100 years ago, a Yadav was a cowherd; he still is and will remain soтАЩ. When Yadavs started seeking a position of respect he was called a cowherd. The politics of respect of the times of Lalu YadavтАж(obviously Dalits and backwards were considered outside the bounds of respect)тАжto some extent тАУ what Satishji was alluding to тАУ when they got power, the did misuse it. This too is a part of history and has to be taken a note of. But the fact also remains that they [dominant castes] could chase Dalits away by brandishing just one stick. And the OBC communities, Arfa, couldnтАЩt open their mouth in front of the bureaucrats. Thus, the slogan that Laluji gave тАУ of a politics of respect тАУ it was intended for the Dalits and OBCsтАж There was yet another factor that the other two panellists havenтАЩt yet mentioned тАУ they might elaborate upon it later тАУ you ask the Muslims what the 15-year long Lalu Prasad Yadav regime was like. During the 2005 elections, a journalist asked a paan seller who he will vote for. The paan seller replied, тАШObviously Laluji!тАЩ. So, the journalist as him a counter-question, тАШWhy Laluji?тАЩ. He replied тАШIf I vote for Laluji at least my paan stall will not be destroyedтАЩ. In other words, even a paan stall was secure because of LaluтАЩs rule. So just what is being called тАШJungle RajтАЩ? The bureaucracy of that very тАШJungle RajтАЩ shuddered in fear because of Lalu Yadav. Agreed, there shouldnтАЩt be riots. [But] for the 17% population of Bihar тАУ you can ask them тАУ was it тАШJungle RajтАЩ? Another consideration; for the sake of comparison тАУ and I would urge Ratan Lal and Satish Singh to contemplate upon this тАУ I belong to that generation of Biharis, Arfa, which began arriving in Delhi in the 80s. Lalu ji was nowhere to be seen; BiharтАЩs educational institutions had just begun their decline. The very presence of Bihari students in the University of Delhi, as well as Jawaharlal Nehru University, can be understood to mean that the educational situation in Bihar had undergone a collapse. Lalu Prasad Yadav was not to be seen anywhere. So, just which тАШJungle RajтАЩ is being talked about? Indeed, there was a culture of extortionтАж Also read: Watch | Why This Village in Bihar Has Pledged to Not Vote for Nitish Kumar AKS: I would like to move on to Professor Ratan LalтАжsince there are a lot of questionsтАж I understand all of your experiences and I want to document them through this programme. Since this is what, I feel, is important. This is not like any other discussion that I hold every day. I feel that the three of you have understood Bihar from your specific perspectives. We are documenting your life experiences via this programme. What I want to understand is that does pro-backward politics have to necessarily be anti-upper caste? Because we understand pro-backward politics as a form of progressive politics; a kind of politics that takes us towards progress. When we take note of upper-caste oppression, need we claim that if the backward-castes come to power, they too will be oppressive? How should we view these two eras of rule? How will we claim that the rule of the backward-castes is better than the rule of the upper-castes? RL: IтАЩm not defending any kind of crime or extortion. WhatтАЩs wrong is wrong and those wrongs have been committed during all regimes. The problem is when you only see half the history. Tell me one thing, before the 90s тАУ Congress was in a position of responsibility. People may not want to talk about the RJD of the time before the 90s, because of the alliance тАУ so, before the 90s, where did the party in power derive its social strength from? From the same source that strengthens BJP today! Or those that are with Nitish Kumar today. The society will remain the same, wonтАЩt it. If DalitsтАЩ, backwardsтАЩ, AdivasisтАЩ rights have been taken away; who has done this? A Bangladeshi immigrant? An American citizen? Who has committed deprived them of their rights? If in University of Delhi тАУ its been almost 100 years since [its inception] in 1922 тАУ there hasnтАЩt been one Dalit Vice Chancellor, is it an American who will be made [Vice Chancellor]? To raise such questions is our duty. I am not speaking as any party spokesperson, but as a student of history. In the 90sтАжI can tell you the names of the gangs in Bihar, in Muzaffarpur. They used to beat up rickshaw pullers; never pay them for their services. I am talking about Muzaffarpur! My house is situated thereтАжwhere the DM [G] Krishnaiyyah was killed. People used to come, eat at hotels without paying; used to get their shoes polished and not pay; used to travel by rickshaws, beat up the rickshaw driverтАжwhy donтАЩt they talk about all this? What тАШrajтАЩ was that, please define it. Who are the people making up this dominant narrative? Upper caste, upper-class people are defining this dominant narrative, which is why they donтАЩt want to talk about the history before the 90s. I want to talk from the time of Krishna [Sinha] babu onwards. I want to talk about the times before Independence. When elections happened in Bihar in 1937, what went on then? LetтАЩs debate that! What happened in the University of Patna, lets debate that! All universities were strongholds of upper-castes and were filled with goons. I can name them! Everyone knows that every hostel a .56 [revolver]. All IтАЩm saying is that IтАЩm not defending if someone orchestrated a kidnapping LalujiтАЩs regime. But if you want to criticise conscientiously then you must criticise the periods before and after it. AKS: Satishji, let us now focus on the current election. One narrative is that тАШwe accept Tejashwi [Yadav], we may even vote for him but so long as he comes without Lalu YadavтАЩ. What do you make of this? SKS: If a person with 4 kattha [land] defeats another with, say, 10 or 20 kattha [land], he wonтАЩt become rich. The one with 4 kattha [land] is poor, so also is the one who has 10 or 20 kattha [land]. Today, all of Bihar is battling for their bread and butter. This is not about caste. It is not about caste; I can show you forward castes that are battling extreme poverty. There is a massive crisis of employment today. It is a fight for bread and butter. It is a fight for existence. It was said that reservation will get people government jobs. But if only appointments are made will government jobs be given! No appointments are made! There is vacancy in only the army. If the state has exited from the production process and the slogan of тАШminimum government, maximum governanceтАЩ is raised, how will there be any jobs? Will they generate jobs in this era of COVID-19? Tejashwi [Yadav] тАУ heтАЩs a 31-year-oldтАжsorry to use this terminologyтАжa 31-year-old boy; heтАЩs not Lalu and yet attracting greater crowds than Lalu! Also read: тАШCurrent Govt Lacks DeterminationтАЩ: Tejashwi YadavтАЩs Rally in Siwan Stirs up Excitement AKS: But people are saying that they donтАЩt want LaluтАжтАЩwithout LaluтАЩ. IтАЩm talking about this equation. What do make of this? SKS: All IтАЩm saying is that the large crowd of attendees may or may not give [Tejashwi/RJD] votes but TejashwiтАЩs [Yadav] biggest contribution has been of bringing BiharтАЩs central issues тАУ of bread and butter, employment, business тАУ to fore. He made them key issues! He may not become Chief Minister. But the rally of a 31-year-old boy! You look at the numbers of attendees in NitishтАЩs and LaluтАЩs rallies and compare it with the crowds this time. This crowd has come for this [issue of employment]. It is a crowd for [specific] situation. It is true that the poor [and] the oppressed have it worse; truly! Where will you find money to spend for the three Ms тАУ everyone wants a mobile, smartphone that is; a motorbike and medicine? Expenditure is rising! Basic expenditure. The fundamental struggle is for bread and butter; for earnings. RL: I would like to add something. First of all, poverty has no relation to birth. Caste has a relation to birth. Secondly, you can keep Lalu away all you want but there can be no politics in Bihar without Lalu Yadav. Even the BJP asks for votes using Lalu YadavтАЩs name! AKS: тАжyes, against Lalu Yadav! RL: So, if RJD feels that it can fight elections without Lalu Yadav and upper-castes will consider them legitimate leaders, then they are deluded; they shouldnтАЩt be. An upper-caste will consider Tejashwi [Yadav] his leader only when he becomes CM and when the upper-caste holds the 80% creamy layer to his benefit. Only then he will truly consider Tejashwi [Yadav] his leader. AKS: Rizwan Kaiser sahib, does this politics of Tejashwi Yadav тАУ since it is what will decide if Tejashwi Yadav will come without Lalu Yadav or with Lalu Yadav or will Lalu Yadav be in hiding тАУ from your assessment of Tejashwi YadavтАЩs politics, is he trying to say, тАШyes IтАЩm backward caste, my politics is backward-caste politics but I am not against the forward-castesтАЩтАж тАШeven though I am not in a direct face-off with Narendra Modi, I will hide the Muslims behind the stageтАЩ? A kind of a hesitance тАУ I wonтАЩt call it hatred тАУ towards the skullcap and the beard can be seen in him [Tejashwi Yadav]. About the politics of aspiration that he wants to do тАУ which he has termed тАШeconomic justiceтАЩ тАУ do you feel that it will continue even after he becomes CM, if he wants to stay in politics in the longer run? Is it a short-term concern, that the election should be won first and all considerations should be left for later? RK: I would like to narrate an anecdote; it may not be the most appropriate but worth considering all the same. In our childhood, we used to read the story of a wolf who once asked a lamb why he was soiling the [river] water. The lamb replies, тАШSir, IтАЩm sitting in the direction opposite to the [river] stream, how can I soil the water?тАЩ The wolf then says, тАШIf not you, your father must have soiled it!тАЩ If you look at Lalu Prasad Yadav, in a way, he was a force at some stage but I donтАЩt think he is as big of a force today. You are focusing on Tejashwi [Yadav], but what about the forces behind Tejashwi [Yadav]? All of [CPI]ML is behind him, CPI, CPM, other various kinds of people тАУ what is called the тАШaspirational segmentтАЩ. And I agree with Satishji when he says that at the fundamental level it is a struggle for existence and survival. Tejashwi [Yadav] is the face; the forces behind Tejashwi [Yadav] are completely different people. Also read: Bihar: Independent Candidate Sanjay Sahni Accuses RJD Leader of Intimidation AKS: I want to add a question here since the discussion is not at all about whether Tejashwi [Yadav] is losing or winning. WeтАЩre trying to understand these elections by placing the political narrative and history on a map. So, my question is that even if Tejashwi Yadav winsтАжif there is a narrative of social justiceтАжlet me take the example of Narendra Modi тАУ heтАЩs not upper caste, he is an OBC but despite that if he is able to maintain upper caste supremacy then how does it matter who [the leader] is? If he is the bearer [of power] тАж our president is Dalit, but despite the huge incident happened at Hathras, he didnтАЩt utter a word to express his sorrow; not in the capacity of a Dalit but in the capacity of the President. So, what IтАЩm trying to say is that if a rule has to be established; if a rule has to be established of the politically dominant, then how does it matter whether Tejashwi [Yadav] wins or Nitish Kumar wins? RK: One thing must be kept in mind: currently the Bihar elections arenтАЩt even being fought on the issues of social justice. The Bihar election is being fundamentally fought on the issue of economic reconstruction. Reconstruction and reorganisation of Bihar. There is no call for social justice. He [Tejashwi Yadav] admits that socially we have Dalits, OBCs, other sections but weтАЩre with the forward castes and the minorities. In Bihar and in the entire country, Narendra Modi has marginalised Muslims to such an extent that other parties donтАЩt mention them out of the fear that they will, in some way, become a focus in their election campaigns. Tejashwi [Yadav] at least is courageous enough to say that we are taking all sections together, even the minorities. So, this election is not in the name of social justice, Arfa. It is for the reconstruction of the whole of Bihar in the realms of economy, employmentтАж AKS: Ratan Lalji, are these the demands of our times that there are no takers for a politics of social justice? Should a new kind of politics be done? RL: A politics of social justice exists and will continue to exist whether or not political parties want. We the activists will make it so! Secondly, economic justice has a relation to state policy. Is there any agenda on privatisation? Has any party said we will stop privatisation? That we will give representation to the small sector? If everyone has to serve [Gautam] Adani-[Mukesh]Ambani then what will you do? We know how one gets jobs in the media; how one gets private sector jobs, we know it all. Your bio-data speaks of your caste, religionтАжtry searching for homes in Delhi as a Muslim. No one will give you a house. See it [economic justice] is related to [state] policy. If you donтАЩt have a stand on privatisation, then you should drop it! Economic justice for whom? Reservation is related to suffering. For economic justice multiple state policies existтАж RK: IтАЩd like to say something Arfa. I feel that in the current scenario тАУ the entire conversation about social justice and various other things тАУ these things will always be talked about. It is inherent in this kind of politics. What IтАЩm saying is thatтАжif you remember the slogan given during the Mandal Commission implementation; the widespread OBC assertionтАжin Bihar there was a slogan that said тАШbhura baal saaf karoтАЩ тАУ remove the brown-haired [i.e. the forward-castes]. BiharтАЩs OBC assertion has surpassed this today. Now it does not talk about тАШremoving the brown-hairedтАЩ but says that our politics will be elevated to the state-level and everyone will find a place in it! Everyone will find a place in it only when BiharтАЩs own position is secureтАж RL: Even during LaluтАЩs era there was place for everyone тАУ you can check the data тАУ how many secretaries were what [caste], how many vice chancellors were what [caste], how many builders were what [caste]. Places were fixed even in the times of Lalu Yadav. The only difference being that Yadavs were the dominant caste. This was the only difference; the rest of the structure was the sameтАжit wasnтАЩt as if Lalu Yadav chased everyone [dominant castes] away from Bihar. Also read: Watch | Bihar Elections: Who Are Muslim Voters Going to Vote For? RK: In a way, yesтАж AKS: Satish ji for last comments I want to come to you. Is this 30-year-long chapter тАУ 15 years of Lalu Yadav, 15 of Nitish Kumar тАУ now ending? Is this now a new beginning? Do you think so? SKS: I want to present some facts in front of you Arfaji. You may even know this тАУ everyone would. In a state where no one knows what exists in the name of industry; no one knows how to get a job, whether or not one does get a job; which has high levels of malnutrition, which has the highest level of migration (out of all large states); where external forces contribute to 33% of its economy; where poverty ranges lies anywhere between 33% to 35 % and which has the maximum unemployed graduates (out of all large states) and which has the highest dropout rate. Then that state тАУ despite reservations, greater [reservation] for those who are more backward тАУ needs major relief! Only if all these things exist will people get them! You saw what happened in Russia, when the poor got a voice. Please run the state as per due process. Start businesses. Generate employment. And what is all this talk about creating a тАШnewтАЩ Bihar? The forward castes will dominate. Technology jobsтАжobviously the one who is educated will get it. The fundamental thing, in one phrase, is that it is a fight for bread and butter. The old times of those who studied using a chalk and slate have long gone. There is no online education in Bihar. You are preparing a new generation; you should at least provide employment. If you wonтАЩt give jobsтАж AKS: Yes, thank you very much. YouтАЩre saying that it is a fight for bread and butter; for who will be able to learnтАж RL: No, not just bread and butter. Bread and butter and respect. IтАЩm sitting here in the campus of the University of Delhi, despite having written a dozen books and research articles, [apparently] I lack meritтАжa SC judge says it too. The issue is not of employment but of respect.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

"850",7394,"https://thekashmirwalla.com/2020/11/in-india-dalit-women-raped-to-assert-caste-supremacy-report/","In India, Dalit women raped ""to assert caste supremacy"": Report","Lower-caste Dalit women in northern India are targeted for rape by upper caste men who usually escape justice as survivors bow to pressure to drop their cases, researchers found on Wednesday, reported Reuters. Only 10 per cent of forty rape cases involving Dalit women and girls in Haryana state ended with the conviction of all those charged, and these involved murder or victims under the age of six, found two rights groups, Equality Now and the Swabhiman Society. In almost 60 per cent of cases, the survivor withdrew her case and accepted a тАЬcompromiseтАЭ settlement outside the legal system, usually after unofficial village councils, or Khap Panchayats, coerced the women to abandon their quest for justice, it said. тАЬSurvivors are threatened, face violence, their families are ostracised and there is extreme pressure to stay silent,тАЭ Manisha Mashaal, founder of the Dalit rights group, Swabhiman Society, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. тАЬTo access justice, survivors have to put their lives at risk and endanger their families as well.тАЭ HaryanaтАЩs director general of police Manoj Yadava said that he was unaware of the report, adding that they had a тАЬzero toleranceтАЭ policy to crimes against women in the state. The rights groups said men from dominant castes frequently use sexual violence as a weapon to reinforce caste and gender hierarchies, which place IndiaтАЩs 200 million Dalits on the lowest rung of an ancient caste hierarchy. The report highlights the challenges Dalits face in getting justice, despite tougher anti-rape laws introduced after a fatal gang rape in 2012, and nationwide protests last month over the alleged gang rape of a Dalit teen who later died. тАЬDalit womenтАЩs bodies are being used to assert caste supremacy and keep women тАШin their placeтАЩ,тАЭ Jacqui Hunt, Eurasia Director of womenтАЩs rights group, Equality Now, said in a statement. тАЬPerpetrators from dominant castes know they are likely to go unpunished because every branch and echelon of the system is weighted in their favour, and this impunity for rape creates an enabling environment that fosters further abuse.тАЭ In almost 90 per cent of cases, at least one of the accused was from a dominant caste, with men often acting in groups to carry out gang-rape and murder, the research found. The police frequently failed to record or investigate crimes when initially reported and were sometimes abusive or put pressure on survivors to drop cases, the report said, with survivors not given adequate advice about their legal rights. тАЬI can guarantee that every complaint that is brought to the police is being registered and investigated,тАЭ Yadava said. тАЬWe have 32 all-women police stations and a womenтАЩs helpline number. We are not hiding any cases coming to us or brushing them under the carpet. We are proud of our record of action against these crimes.тАЭ He added that out of court settlements were a social problem and awareness was being created to address it. But one 28-year-old survivor said her family were being harassed by a man who raped her in 2018 after she rejected his advances. тАЬEven before I could recover from the trauma of what had happened, his family and other upper-caste men were at our doorstep,тАЭ said the woman. тАЬI was forced to marry my rapist and then tortured by the family. I ran away and decided to fight my case. But every day they show up to threaten us and my mother cries in fear. I hope I get justice and all this trauma will finally end.тАЭ Copyright ┬й TKW Media Private Limited.","none","none",0,NA,NA,NA

"852",7418,"https://www.dalitcamera.com/caste-food-ideological-imposition/","Caste, food and ideological imposition ├В┬╖ Dalit Camera","Eggs have been denied to children as part of the mid day meals in schools for several years. Described as the тАШmenstrual dischargeтАЩ of the hen, eggs are labelled as тАШsinfulтАЩ, тАШviolentтАЩ, and agitating the senses, with egg eaters deserving to be тАШdestroyedтАЩ. Written by Dr. Sylvia Karpagam|Bengaluru|November 22, 2020 Meghala (6 year old dalit girl) тАУтАЬMalnutrition or pneumonia or malnutrition?тАЭ Meghala, a tiny girl of 6 years, had large, luminous eyes that looked soulfully at you. She lived with her older sister Ruth aged 12 and visually impaired mother, Murugamma in a tin shed in Roshan Nagar in DJ Halli, Bengaluru and was hungry most of the time. Severely malnourished, weighing only 12 kg, she didnтАЩt come under the radar of either the Women and Child Development (WCD) department or the Health department. Following media and civil society outrage after her death, the Women and Child development minister claimed that her death was not due to malnutrition but due to pneumonia, while the Health department laid the blame squarely on her nutritional status, denying pneumonia as a causative factor. However, the fact of the matter was that this little dalit girl child had been betrayed by both the departments and that she had been sucked into a vicious cycle where malnutrition increased the risk of disease which in turn further aggravated the malnutrition. According to the National Family Health Survey 4, [NFHS4, 2015], less than 10% of the 6 to 23 month children in India are adequately fed. Now, with the Covid -19 pandemic and lockdown, supply of mid day meals/dry rations at government/aided schools and anganwadis has deteriorated even further. Geetha (Activist and mother)-тАЬItтАЩs better not to give children food than to give this kind of food which is neither nutritious nor tastyтАЭ Geetha is an activist and more importantly a mother. She knows that onions, garlic, other spices, eggs and other animal sources of food help improve both the taste and nutritional quality of the food. She also unequivocally asserts that this is certainly not being provided to the children by one of the largest contractors for the government mid day meal scheme тАУThe Akshaya Patra Foundation. This organisation, an initiative of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) with a religious prerogative of тАШadvocating a lacto-vegetarian diet, strictly avoiding meat, fish and eggsтАЩ considers onions and garlic in food as тАЬlower modes of nature which inhibit spiritual advancementтАЩ. Geetha bemoans the casteist/religious/cultural indoctrination by Akshaya patra which vehemently refuses to use onion and garlic in their cooking inspite of this being mandated in State government menu. Coincidentally, research conducted by Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru, shows that the absorption of zinc and iron from cooked food is higher in the presence of onion and garlic. Iron and zinc, along with many other minerals and vitamins, as well as protein, are essential in the management of iron deficiency anemia, which, according to NFHS4 data has a prevalence of 53.9 percent in children belonging to the general category and 60.5, 63.1 and 58.6 in children belonging to SC, ST and OBC castes respectively. The National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (MDM Scheme), launched in August 1995 lays emphasis on providing cooked meals with a minimum 450 тАУ 700 calories and 8-12 grams of proteins and was further converted by the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 into a legal right upto Class 8. Over 94% of the children in government and government aided schools come from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes and minority communities. Among children (under five years) belonging to Scheduled Tribes, 43.8 percent children under five are stunted (less than expected heights for age) and 45.3 are underweight (less than expected weights for age), while 42.8 percent children from the Scheduled Caste community are stunted and 39.1 percent are underweight. For a majority (94%) of children in government schools who are from marginalised communities and malnourished, garlic, onion and eggs form an important part of their diets, limited only by the factor of affordability. That these are being denied to them by communities that donтАЩt even attend government schools, is a good example of how caste-based discrimination of children from vulnerable communities is institutionalised. Eggs have been denied to children as part of the mid day meals in schools for several years. Described as the тАШmenstrual dischargeтАЩ of the hen, eggs are labelled as тАШsinfulтАЩ, тАШviolentтАЩ, and agitating the senses, with egg eaters deserving to be тАШdestroyedтАЩ. If, instead of this unscientific propaganda, the nutritional value of eggs had been the primary deciding factor, children would have been given eggs as part of the mid day meal scheme on 5 days of the week. Along with this, if beef bans and its associated criminalisation/mob murders of beef eaters had not existed, stunting, undernutrition, iron/zinc/B12 deficiency would have been addressed by the country quite efficiently. To retain the unscientific, casteist status quo, people are instead being subjected to drugs and poor dietary advice. Doors are also being thrown open to greedy corporates to bring in fortification, processed foods, ready to eat therapeutic pastes etc. As part of the process of encouraging school based hot cooked meals, an interim order of the Supreme court regarding mid day meals, dated 20th April 2004 mandates that тАЬIn appointment of cooks and helpers, preference shall be given to Dalits, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.тАЭ In practice, this has faced severe backlash and centralised kitchens such as Akshaya patra, could as well be a way to reinforce age old practices that do not allow dalit women near food preparation areas. Saranamma (Dalit traditional birth attendant/sulagithi) тАУ тАЬCome IтАЩll walk with you to the other side of the river and weтАЩll come back with the light of your lifeтАЭ Saranamma is an 85-year-old traditional birth attendant/ dai/sulagithi in Karnataka. She is a dalit woman. Her role is literally to accompany a pregnant woman physically, psychologically and emotionally throughout her pregnancy and post partum period. She mostly has magic in her hands тАУ either when she is massaging away aches and pains, or when she is preparing a magic drink to reduce some mysterious pregnancy/post partum discomfort, or when she is putting together ingredients to create a nutrient packed meal to build up the stamina of the mother. She has learnt, from a long oral tradition handed down to her over the years from her mother or mother in law, exactly what can relieve problems arising during pregnancy, labour or later. Sometimes she adds fish as the secret ingredient, sometimes turmeric, sometimes mutton, sometimes something else. Saranamma can take one look at a woman and KNOW when her labour is due, whether it is real or false labour pain, if it will be complicated (needing referral) or smooth, or whether the woman just needs to use the toilet. She will pack a small bag with her essentials and walk long distances through difficult routes accompanying anyone who knocks at her door with the message тАШshe is in labourтАЩ. One fine day, the Government of India suddenly decided that all deliveries would need to take place in institutions and the practice of home delivery was made illegal, almost overnight. The sulagathi was relegated to the status of a criminal. [A brahmin тАШayurvedicтАЩ specialist was part of a group that wanted to document the practices of the sulagathi. She тАШanalysedтАЩ all the data related to food and treatment, eliminated all the animal source food related preparations and presented the data at a national conference as тАШthe rich Ayurvedic tradition of IndiaтАЩ] Khatija Bee (Muslim senior citizen living in an urban deprived area) тАЬThe doctor says donтАЩt eat meat, donтАЩt eat eggs. Eat only fruits and vegetables. Still my sugar levels havenтАЩt come below 350тАЭ Khatija Bee from Lingarajpuram, Bangalore had a blood sugar of 360 and blood pressure of 190/100 when last examined in August during a medical camp. She also complains of breathlessness and chest pain on exertion. She was referred to the only government cardiology hospital in the State, for тАЬemergency management and treatment of cardiac condition, only to be told that she could not be treated тАШbecause of CovidтАЩтАЭ. India has the dubious distinction of being the diabetes capital of the world, with 8.7% people in the age group of 20 тАУ 70, or 50 million people living with diabetes in India. It is an attributable risk factor for several complications affecting the eyes, heart, kidney, nervous system and circulatory system. People who have had a heart attack or stroke have a high likelihood of a previous history of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy contributes to 2.6% of global blindness. Patients in India with diabetes induced kidney failure face the grim prospect of dialysis, with its exorbitant cost and poor availability, or a kidney transplant, which is often mired in illegality. Anyone who is diagnosed with diabetes in India is likely to repeatedly hear one specific bit of unsolicited advice ad nauseum and that is to тАЬStop eating meatтАЩ. In reality, cutting down on sugars, reducing traditional cereals (read carbohydrates), and increasing the consumption of animal source foods, has the ability to drastically prevent or reduce the large scale prevalence of diabetes and its complications. In India, distancing oneself from the тАШpolluting, inferiorтАЩ meat and meat eaters is a deliberately exaggerated casteist behaviour marker. Although only about 30% of Indians self identify as vegetarian, this too could be an inflated number because of the stigma surrounding meat eating. Ironically, milk and milk products are conveniently labelled as тАШvegetarianтАЩ ignoring their animal based composition. In India, politics, culture, religion, caste and economics around cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, oils, eggs, meat etc., prevent any rational or evidence based conversations around food. Even a suspicion of transporting beef or a mention of its nutritional/cultural/religious value can trigger a series of events ranging from abuse, arrest, harassment and lynching. The idea that dalit, Adivasi and OBC children should be grateful for whatever food is тАШgivenтАЩ to them is deeply ingrained in the minds of doctors, activists, researchers, policy makers and pretty much the entire gamut of citizens in the country. The idea that children have inviolable rights to healthy, nutritious, tasty, clean, culturally relevant food is lost on most people who claim these same rights only for themselves. This is the crux of how caste discrimination operates in India, reinforcing all the hegemonic, hierarchical imbalances that are so evident that they become invisible. An entire mafia has formed around childrenтАЩs food, making it almost impossible for children to have one decent meal as legally mandated by the NFSA. Organisations like ISKCON or Akshaya patra, with blatantly casteist/religious ideology are placed on a pedestal above criticism and beyond usual accountability frameworks. It is of utmost importance that dalit, Muslim, Adivasi, Christian communities etc. that consume (and enjoy) eggs, beef, pork, fish, poultry etc. come together to reclaim their food sovereignty and challenge the hegemonic imposition of nutritionally inferior тАШsattvikтАЩ foods. Food could be a powerful rallying factor to bring oppressed communities together.

Two questions for you Aman Deep Is there a тАШright to foodтАЩ тАУ that I should be allowed to / able to eat what is food for me? If yes, then meat, fish, eggs are a part of food for many. Do you think this right can be taken away because тАЬAn organization serves free meal to children тАЭ тАУ Do you think food is a favour you are doing for these children? Would you be Ok if Government forced you to eat meat? If not, then why should you support the Government preventing people who eat meat, onion and garlic from doing so? The mid day meal program is a nation wide program is funded by government, meaning public money. In which case there cannot be any rationale in forcing the dietary habits of some people on others. Such force is a crime. So who is disgusting? Is it not those people who use force on other people and decide their diet for them? By advocating Veganism among non upper castes, what do the upper castes gain? IsnтАЩt meat consumption, one of the main reasons of climate change? IsnтАЩt type 2 diabetes caused by inactivity or stress? IsnтАЩt malnutrition caused by poverty? I mean there are a lot of inconsistencies in the article, in many instances I feel you are just reaching for things without sufficient facts to back your claimsтАж.. I agree with some of the comments above regarding inconsistencies. This article is extremely biased. IтАЩm in no way a supporter of ISKCON but its actually not a casteist organization..the opposite in fact! Many caste conscious Hindus shun it outright precisely because the organization embraces тАЭ mlechasтАЭ and other castes as long as they have love for Lord Krishna. Yes perhaps reflexive despising of non тАЬsattvikтАЭ food is not helpful in a public health crisis involving malnutrition but why blame organizations like Akshaya Patra? Why canтАЩt governmental food schemes work side by side to provide eggs or whatever is considered nutritionally appropriate? So if akshaya patra provides lunch why not breakfast by somebody else ? Here in the west children from non meat eating backgrounds often face the opposite problems where the dominant culture often doesnтАЩt respect their dietary food choices. So that should be the problem not a blanket blaming of caste or ayurveda in my opinion. Further, there is a clinate crisis and meat production is a big contributor to it. So surely that must be addressed as well. Another pseudo lecture. It is time people move away from meat, eggs, milk and other animal products. The cruelty of animal husbandry industry is well known. Animals, which should be leading a free life in the forests are forcefully domesticated and used as a source of meat and other products. Animals are also used for hard labour or other such activities. It is high time that people realise that machines can replace animals and human beings can live without meat or animal products. I do agree with you. ItтАЩs logical to follow the food habits of our ancestors. I am of the opinion that the Govt should not have a say in what we eat, whom we worship and whom we marry. Interestingly India is the largest exporter of beef since 2014. It appears that our Govt is ok with killing animals as long it fetches $. Ironically most of the beef exporters are Indian Hindus who conveniently name their company after Muslim pronouns. Please check out google for тАЬLargest exporters of beef in IndiaтАЭ I feel your pain, Animals going through. Plants do posses life and feelings as per the science, Shall we stop eating plants and plant based food as itтАЩs cruel to kill a plant which cannot even raise a voice unlike animals? Fruits and vegetables are produced by plants for themselves not for humans. Everyone has their right to chose their food. Akshaya PatraтАЩs discussion is not appropriate, they are doing their part to the needy. iskon is a relegious entity, itтАЩs not proper to discuss about them as they are a propaganda like madharsas or missionaries, However satwik food is inferior food at nutritional level given same weight of food. Take an example of 100 gms chicken and 100 gms chickepeas. Volume of 100 gms chicken is way lesser on cooking than Peanuts or chickepeas or any other vegetable for the same amount of calories and nutritional value. I do strongly agree with the above mentioned points about casteism but would like to recommend you to not glorify the practice of dai-conducted or non-institutional delivery since they have long been proven to increase maternal as well as infant mortality and you should be aware of it as you are a public health doctor. A sick nation indeed, sick in body and sick in mind. The brahmin, scourge of the country, curse for the depressed, shame of humanity, excuse for humans, will ensure the country falls into abyss and they survive to see it happen. Truly tragic. They have done it in the past and they will certainly try to do it again. I seriously donтАЩt get why people like you possess hate for brahmin like they have done something wrong. Indians were assaulted by Mughals, English, savotaged our rich culture, looted our treasures but still people says brahmin did so and so. Seriously how could someone so stupid !!

(Image: Twitter) ""Whenever elections are around the corner, they send me to jail,тАЭ the 36-year-old first time CPI(ML) MLA, Manoj Manzil, said. In an attempt to prevent him from campaigning, the CPI(ML) leader said that he was thrown behind bars in the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2015 in Bihar. ""But I managed to secure 35,000 votes even then,тАЭ he said. This time also, he was picked up soon after he filed his nomination from his native Agiaon (SC reserved) seat. Despite all odds, Manzil, the son of a landless farmer couple, secured 86,327 votes, 48,550 more than his nearest rival JD(U)'s Prabhunath Prasad. In 2018, Manzil received accolades for his initiative 'Sadak Pe School', when he, along with his associates from AISA (the students' wing of CPI(ML), gathered children of poor Dalit and Muslim families and started their own schools on public roads. 'Sadak pe School' became simultaneous sites of sit-in protests and places of alternative schooling. Manzil spoke to News18 as a first-time MLA on caste violence, his ascent into left politics and his plans for the future. Could you tell us a bit about your childhood? тАЬI was the only child of a poor landless labour couple. They still work on other peopleтАЩs farms. When the farm season ends, my father works in a brick kiln. Our small house is built on 3 dismil (0.01 hectare) of land. I went to Arrah for my graduation and use to teach children in order to support my education. But several times I had to drop out of studies because at times there was not enough to eat at home.тАЭ How did you get into left politics? My family had introduced me to left politics in a way. My father, while being a farm hand, was also a CPI(ML) cadre. My uncle, who was part of Jay Prakash movement, spent his life fighting feudalism and spent 14 years in jail. My mother was also, in her own way, part of the resistance. But the other, the bigger reason was our history. In the '70s, we had repeatedly seen and suffered at the hands of the feudal militia. There is a village not very far from here, and now it is part of my constituency, called Hadiyabad. That's where my mother is from. Private armies owned by feudal lords set it to fire in the early 70s. Not many people survived. My mother was one of them. But she had lost her everything in that carnage. Later on, we saw the aftermath of massacres that were committed by Ranvir Sena (private militia of Bihar's landlords accused of murdering hundreds of Dalits) and we would weep, all the time. As time passed, we suffered police atrocities also. I've got 30 FIRs slapped against me for my activism in education, land reforms etc., by the police and five times I've been to jail. Over time, all these things accumulated in my mind to the point where I decided to work not just for my family but for all the families in my area. How does it feel to finally be an MLA? I haven't found much time since the election results were announced. Two children in my constituency died from a cylinder blast. Just now I finally finished the formalities of getting Rs 8 lakh compensation to the family. Your partyтАЩs remarkable performance has started talks about the possible revival of the left. We worked on the ground for all sections. All our associates from other parties also put their hearts and souls into helping me. There is disappointment over the three seats that our party has lost by margins of less than 150 votes. But we take heart from what we have achieved. Finally, how did you come to have this name? [Laughs] Yes this wasn't my original name, it was Manoj Kumar. I was quite interested in literature. I used to write and direct plays. And one of the words that I kept coming across repeatedly, and which really moved me, was 'Manzil' [destination/goal]. So I took on that name.","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

He is going to talk with us today about his experience of caste in tech and what are the ways forward to eradicate this discrimination in the industry. Jai Bhim, Sam. It's wonderful to have you join us, welcome. Sam Cornelius: Thank you Thenmozhi for giving me this opportunity Thenmozhi: LetтАЩs dig in, shall we? So when we talk about caste in tech, it is really important for our audience to understand where it begins. And I know for you Sam it really started with casteist educational institutions. You, for example, went to IIT Mumbai тАФ where the defendants of the CISCO case also attended тАФ and these institutes are notorious for their casteist cultures. Can you share your experiences? Sam: Thank you for asking the question. As you know, in the US diaspora, the word тАШcasteтАЩ is not known among people. If you are non-Indian especially the word тАШcasteтАЩ is not known. So thank you for bringing this issue to the forefront and giving me this opportunity. Yes, I did join IIT in the 1990s. I was surprised when I made it to the premier institute. It was a dream come true. When I joined IIT in my early teens, I was not aware of how the system works but now I understand how the system at that time was structured. In those days in IITs ragging was common, I am sure the practice still continues. On the first day of college, I had a feeling that the seniors who came to rag me knew my caste identity before I could decide whether I wanted to tell them or not. This became possible because when IIT brings out its ranks, students belonging to scheduled caste and tribes have separate ranks from general category students who get all-India ranks. So letтАЩs say a general category student holds 1st, 2nd or 3rd position, their rank would be AIR 1, 2, or 3. Whereas in the case of a student who belongs to the scheduled castes or tribes and holds the 1st, 2nd or 3rd position, their rank would be SC 1, 2, or 3. Your roll number and rank is also put on the notice board and as a result, students, especially seniors, find out if you have come through the reservation. Before IIT, I went to Osmania University, Hyderabad. There you had only one rank for all students, so I did not understand why IITs had to come up with different ranks just because they provide affirmative action. That I didnтАЩt understand but it's step one of IIT where they already have, by their ranks, differentiated. If I am not wrong, during those days even for answer sheets they used a different coloured answer sheet if you are from SC and ST category as opposed to non-SC and ST. At that time there was no OBC reservation but I am sure OBCs would come into the same thing now. So thatтАЩs where it starts from, which means, from the person who is correcting our answer sheets. When we asked them why different coloured sheets were used, they would reply by saying it makes things easy and cite many different reasons. So the different ranks and different coloured sheets, at the entry itself, ensure that you are discriminated against based on your caste. Thenmozhi: So Sam, just so it is clear for our audience, Dalit students who are reservation or affirmative action beneficiaries, have the fact that they are affirmative action students very publicly broadcasted through these many different ways that you just talked about. Whether it is your attendance number or examination answer sheet, the public nature of you being marked as a reservation student opens up a pathway for so much bullying and discrimination. It's also partially because with that information being made public people can now know whom to segregate and discriminate against. Is that right? Sam: Yes, based on your roll no. your rank is decided. In every IIT your roll no. and rank are put up on the notice board. An SC and ST student does not get an all Indian rank. When even writing entrance examinations, they also have different coloured answer sheets from general category students. I think the reason given to us for doing this was that it is done to give special consideration to Dalit students. I hope this practice does not happen today. I felt very odd amidst these practices. A coloured sheet may expose a student to a casteist professor who rather than being considerate may turn out to be biased. As a Dalit I always tell people we donтАЩt need your favors, what we need are checks and balances, that will prevent people from dominating us and we will run. Such checks and balances will ensure that there is no way for people to discriminate us, and in case there is discrimination they should be scared that the law will hold them accountable. Till 12th standard, when I was living in Hyderabad, I had experienced no ragging. I used to go home, I was a day scholar. But in IIT I faced ragging for the first time. One evening my seniors came up to me and said: тАЬBoss, I know who you are, so donтАЩt try to fool me.тАЭ Upper caste students used different names to identify people belonging to scheduled castes and schedule tribes. Some of them would refer to us as тАШcatusтАЩ which was used to refer to students from a category. Others used to тАШsuc-sutтАЩ (ph) which is how they used to pronounce SC and ST. In front of us they would tell that these words mean something, but internally they used it to discuss, to identify people based on their caste. Thenmozhi: And Sam, I think I want to emphasise for our listeners here that the IITs are where people of privilege have their caste capital get converted into tech capital. Whereas, for our community, we are going there to be able to have a better life, for ourselves and for our families. When entering these very hostile places we know, from the work of Ambedkar-Periyar study circles at IIT Madras and IIT Mumbai, how deeply casteist these institutions are. We see complaints from both Dalit students, Dalit faculty and Dalit workers. In fact, in IIT Mumbai there was a professor called Rahul Deshmukh who had tortured and harassed two Dalit workers because they wanted to unionise. Their condition got so bad, that they tried to commit suicide on his doorstep. One of the things that they mentioned in their letter was how he told them, тАЬthis institute is not for Mahars and Bhangis, how dare you unionise, get out of here!тАЭ These things are reported in mainstream news but due to the impunity related to caste we know nothing will happen to the perpetrator of such atrocity. As a result, people who are of caste privilege just get bigger and bolder. The CISCO defendants who also went to IIT Mumbai, entered this environment where dominant caste people are kind of puffed up, where they get to talk about their bootstrapтАЩs narrative which says - look we are just here because of merit. These same people then go on to create casteist alumnus networks that lead to them being part of internal referral networks into companies. Sam, can you talk a little about how these casteist schools led to casteist companies in the valley and throughout tech? Sam: I just want to say something here on the topic of suicides. As I was telling you from the moment you enter IIT, along with the students the professors know you are from the caste category. Once you have identified at the age of 18 or 19, you are out of their closed groups. So you feel isolated, a little bit. There are also no checks and balances to ensure that the professors are grading Dalit students fairly. Many Dalit students come from non-english speaking background but they may still perform well in exams. I have travelled across IITs and spoken to people, there is no SC/ST cell in any IIT, where students could seek help from a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe professor. In fact, there is no representation of scheduled caste and scheduled caste professors at all, and this might at the root of all discrimination. All faculty advisors are professors from the general category, who donтАЩt understand our problems and we canтАЩt tell our problems to them easily. Many students feel that if they complain these professors will think that despite getting concessions at the entry level they still want more concessions. So this leads to isolation. In case you are getting low grades, there is no support system that can bring these issues up which leads to more feelings of isolation. In my second year in IIT, there was a scheduled caste girl who burnt herself in her hostel. If you look at the statistic there is at least one case of suicide in all B-Tech undergrad courses across all IITs. In this if you include other premier institutes like AIIMS, NIIT you would have at least five suicides per year. The cream of our society donтАЩt just enter tech industries but they also travel to different parts of the world. So it is in the interest of the country to have to know what caste discrimination is and ensure that every SC and ST person who enters their company scales up too. Most MNCs in India and abroad are headed by upper caste individuals. Since the issue of caste based discrimination is not addressed in premier institutes it travels across the world. When I was young I did not understand that I am not just a student but a representative of my community. There are only a few seats that are reserved for the SC and ST community, so when you get a seat because of your marks and skills, you no long remain just Sam but you become a representative of the entire community. So they bring down the whole community when they bring down Sam. And if one Sam commits suicide, the whole community also loses. If there is 15 percent reservation for scheduled castes and 7.5 percent reservation for scheduled tribes, even those minimum seats were not filled till 2015. This is only students, at the level of professors and others you will hardly find that there is even 1 percent of the seats in IITs, IIMs and AIIMS filled by professors belonging to the scheduled castes. So that same thing of discrimination because nobody has exposed it or nobody feels that they are doing anything wrong travels across institutes and then further it spreads to the companies that they get into. And from companies it travels to different countries. In the US too they come with this mentality that that government has done a big favor by providing scheduled castesтАЩ and tribeтАЩs reservation in the constitution. And their story ends there. So now a Dalit has to fight his way out. Thenmozhi: If I can jump in here because I think it is very clear that there is a deep level of pain that our communities face when they go into such deeply casteist institutes. And it is very clear from the things that you are sharing with us that it is systemic. There are no checks and balances. Dalits who persevered through this very violent environment, had probably hoped that after leaving casteist schools that they would enter workplaces that were less casteist. But what we are finding, particularly with the CISCO lawsuit, is that these workplaces are also deeply casteist. And I am wondering if you could speak a little bit, I know it is painful, about the nature of challenges caste oppressed employees face in hostile tech workplaces. Sam: ThatтАЩs a very good question. The CISCO case that you mentioned surprised us all. The case was not filed by the company itself but the employee with help of the organisation that looks into these matters filed the case. Which means it took some time for the employee to bring the matter to light. If you look at the US particularly, 99 percent of non-Indian don't know what caste is. It is surprising because they have been employing millions of Indians for more than 20+ years, and they still don't know what caste is. And it's not just employees or citizens but even companies are not aware. Thenmozhi: I mean Sam, letтАЩs just be clear, there is a failure of duty of care by these companies to hire, work and serve huge populations of South Asians and for them to not have the basic competency related to caste. ThatтАЩs a failure on them and they are going to be taken to task about it. And this lawsuit is really just the tip of the iceberg around it. But again I think that knowingly they have hired hundreds of thousands of Indians into their workplaces but their HR departments donтАЩt have caste as a protective category. Their HR, Diversity and Inclusion team members donтАЩt understand caste. Which has created a situation where there is a lot of caste based discrimination at the workplace. And so I am just wondering, knowing these tense situations, particularly what have you experienced? If you could speak to some of the ways in which Dalits have to hide their identity and things like a Tam-Brahm pact. What are some of the conditions that get created for Dalits in the workplace? Sam: I have worked for top MNCs, who have offices both in India and outside. Their HR documents mention that you cannot discriminate against employees based on their race, gender or country of origin. The HR policy in India, too, doesnтАЩt mention that you cannot discriminate based on caste. When I approached the HR regarding this situation, they mentioned they did it to ensure consistency across HR policies in different countries. So one would think that then you should mention caste-based discrimination in your HR policy wherever you are employing Indians. Wherever Indians go, their caste goes with them. So even in the CISCO case, they have been taking this protection that in their HR policy caste-based discrimination is not mentioned. Again, when I came to the US for the first time in my early 20s, at that time, there were groups that were brought from premier institutes to the US. They have their own networks. Sometimes there is no easy way of identifying someoneтАЩs caste. Even though in the majority of the cases you can tell if someone is a category student or not by their surname but in a few cases it is difficult. In those special cases, other ways are employed to find out your caste. They would call you to different pujas and based on your reaction, they would try to guess your caste. If you say you are not interested in pujas, that gives it away. They would ask questions like are you vegetarian and if you say yes I am vegetarian, they will ask are you vegetarian by birth or by choice. So they try to find out your caste in one way or the other. If you are a male adult, they would call you for a ceremony called Rasvim or they will pat your back to find out if you are wearing the white thread or not. The white thread is worn by upper castes, primarily Brahmins. So if you are not wearing a white thread, they would know that you are not from an upper caste group. They are very connected in their groups and in MNCs, everything is driven by networks. If one person knows that you are not an upper-caste man before I even drive and reach my home in one hour the message has reached the entire network. Now, because US folks are not aware of caste, there are no checks and balances to prevent discrimination. One of the ways in which I got impacted was that in all MNCs there is an appraisal system that happens every year. Now if you ask anyone working in an MNC, they will tell you that appraisals are a big thing and that everybody works their butt off to get a good appraisal rating that defines everything. Your salary increments are decided by your appraisal ratings and your promotion is based on your appraisal rating. Your progression is defined by your salary ratings. If you are off-shore in India, whether you can travel on-site or not is determined by that appraisal rating. So when I came here to the US, we had a meeting with a client who was very eager to know about caste. He said that he had been reading a lot about caste in India and found out that it was a big challenge in India, so he asked: тАЬYou guys are here in the US, what is your take on caste?тАЭ So my upper-caste bosses - mostly in all MNCs if they are headed by Indians, the top positions are occupied by upper castes, you would rarely find a Dalit - in that meeting, my boss, as has been the tradition since the time we graduated from premier institutes, so they still feel that caste system is not a bad thing. He started saying in the meeting to the client: тАЬLook in the olden days there was this great thing called the caste system. Society was divided, the Brahmins were like the managers and they used to strategise, below them are Kshtrayis who protected society from outside attack. After them, there were Vaishyas who were looking at all money matters and finally, there was the Shudra who provided their services to all the classes. So it was a wonderful system. It was after the British came that divisions started to fester in the country. If given a choice I would like to go back to the old India when we were called Golden India.тАЭ After listening for two or three minutes, I could not take it, and I jumped in and said, тАЬlook, because you are a Brahmin or an upper-caste person you may like it but if you ask any lower-caste person they would call the caste system monstrous. Caste has ruined everything they have got, including their human dignity. They have been discriminated against and they have not been given access to education, they were not given access to money, making jobs, they were not given access to the UN. If you take any newspaper, even today, Dalits are facing atrocities and rapes in the name of caste. And these atrocities have been recognised by the constitution of India. There are very strong laws against caste-based discrimination and a lot of work is happening to annihilate caste. So if you think caste is good, then it is only good for the top 3 percent or 5 percent but not for the entire society. So that's my take.тАЭ Suddenly everybody got silent. They couldnтАЩt understand why I would say that. In one sense, they felt that probably I am lowering the status of India. When I spoke against casteism they thought I was talking against India. The upper caste bosses, in their looks, I could feel basically they got hurt because they think the caste system is their heritage and great tradition in which I am trying to find faults in and giving the wrong impression to a non-Indian. In reality, they still think that caste is good for society so anyone talking against the caste system is a no-no to them. After that meeting within a month there was an appraisal - and as I had mentioned your appraisal drives everything - and even though nothing about my work had changed from the previous year when I got the highest rating. I was engaging with the same clients and the same level of delivery yet my rank fell two-levels below the rank I had received in the previous year. I could not understand this, and so I reached out to some people because the ratings are not given by only one person but a set of people together and they discuss. I asked on such person who participated in the ranking and asked him what had happened, he told me that I didnтАЩt deserve the rank which I got but a few people in the office insisted that my rank be brought down. These were some people who were there with me in the meeting where I had spoken out against the caste system. After the rating fell down, I was told that I might be asked to leave the US and move offshore in India where I was needed more. So literally I can see there was no other reason for this decision besides me coming out so strongly against the caste system and exposing myself to caste bias. Because of my degree and experience, I did not have a problem getting another job in India. So I moved to India for three months but there were people who said why didnтАЩt you complain but it is very difficult because it was a hunch, I cannot prove anything. I could have filed a complaint on the ground that despite good performance I was given a lower ranking but the caste angle would have been difficult to prove. Eventually, I left the job in India because I got a job offer from the US and I had to move back to the US for my childrenтАЩs education. But yes, that is one instance where it clearly came out how caste could impact. Thenmozhi: This is so great Sam that you were brave enough to stand up to this nonsense, particularly, because it is such a dominant caste point of view, to see from a place of privilege, that caste bring stability. But of course for those of us who are caste oppressed, that stability for the privileged is bought at the cost of our communityтАЩs lives. I have heard so many people in the diaspora make this argument and it is tone-deaf and violent. Can you imagine people justifying another system of violence like slavery or apartheid simply for its stability? It's so offensive. I also want to ask Sam, how difficult was it to even think about going to HR? As in, what is the general difficulty our people have when reporting caste discrimination in tech workspaces? And I am wondering if you could even go into what your own consideration was in deciding not to report? Sam: That is a very good point which you have brought. A factor that people generally donтАЩt acknowledge is immigration status. For somebody who is on a work visa here, especially those who have their kids in schools. In this situation, it is not about me making money or not, it's like the kids who have done all their education here suddenly they have to shift to the education in India where you have to study the regional language and the system of education is very different. In India, you have to mug things and write and here you are trained to do things instead. So it becomes very difficult for the children to adjust. This was also the biggest consideration as a parent when a company suddenly asks you to move back to India. So that was the biggest thing on my mind. Therefore, keeping my children in mind, I had to think about how to come back as soon as possible. H1 visa lets you work in the US for six years in case you have filed for a green card, and if you have a green card then you can stay as long as you want. The biggest thing on my mind at that time was that my company had to apply for my green card, that is what I was promised when I came to the US. So the biggest concern on my mind when I had to leave my previous company was this because I thought I would be in the US until at least my kidsтАЩ education finishes. But for me my kids were in middle school and high school, and so it was of critical importance that the kidsтАЩ education does not get impacted. Fortunately for me, I applied to a US-based company and I came back. In case I went to HR, they would have probably probed the case from the angle that despite doing well, I was given poor ranking. They would have not looked from the caste point of view as I had mentioned earlier in the HR policy, they donтАЩt recognise caste-based discrimination. Secondly, I could not have proved with evidence that what happened was as a result of caste, which would have become very difficult for me. If I fought the case, I would have probably been able to increase my rating by one level, based on my performance. But fighting the case from a caste angle, it would have been almost impossible, especially in the US. Even in India it is difficult, I have not heard of a CISCO-like case in any MNC in India. First, caste-based discrimination is not mentioned in HR policies in India. If someone manages to file a complaint against caste discrimination they would find it difficult to prove, even if he manages to prove they would try to close it at the company HR level itself. As we frequently read in Indian newspapers that if a Dalit person filed against rape, the accused seldom goes to jail but the person who complains is put in jail. The same could have happened here. In case I filed a complaint against caste-based discrimination, probably the guy I complained against might get a promotion while I may get a demotion or my career maybe even go for a toss if I am exposed. So that is another fear. Thenmozhi: Sam, I think this is so important that again, even the category of the H1B visa was actually created to prevent organising for a just workplace within tech. So the H1B visa creates a very particular condition where even if you are motivated and are a powerful activist like you are Sam, the reality is because of tension in your workplace, you are not just threatened of losing a job, you are actually also having to deal with the threat of losing your immigration status. That really is a cost too heavy for many Dalits and other caste oppressed Americans to bear because, again, like you said, many people in our community are first-generation earners, we are the first generation immigrants into the United States. And we are not just representing ourselves but we are actually supporting an entire network of families. That pressure and tension is a lot to bear. That is also why we have heard from many, many Dalits since the CISCO case came out Equality Labs has got over 250 rapid responses, emergency complaints from people who were saying they cannot raise this issue at their workplace. We want to be able to have our stories told. I think the CISCO case is really the tip of the iceberg because of how bad the conditions are and Dalits can speak out and we are determined to basically flank the CISCO case to make sure that John Doe gets his time in court. But we also want to be clear that it is not our job to solve hostile workplaces; it is the duty of care of these companies. You have to really look at that fact when you are looking at companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google these are corporations that not only employ hundreds of thousands of Indians both in India and in the US but they also are desperately clawing their way to try to dominate the Indian and South Asian market, because keep in mind one in four people in the world are South Asian, one in six are Indian. So everything about the future of profits of these companies are based upon how well they do in our markets. If they cannot do the very basic diligence they need to do to protect caste-oppressed employees and caste oppressed users of their companiesтАЩ products, well, they are going to reap the whirlwind, because Dalits are not going to stay silent while they create oppressive content that dominates their platform, and create conditions that are violent for our people on the inside. Everything you have said Sam, anyone, any person who has consciously listened to your story, their blood is going to boil. You should not have to take casteist language from someone who is your supervisor. You shouldnтАЩt have to worry about getting demoted or getting challenged on the work front simply because you are telling the facts and they are telling their caste bigotry, then they are shaming you for so-called shaming India. They themselves should carry the burden of this shame because it's not the burden of Dalits to talk and break the silence about this issue anymore. It's now time for people who are benefiting from these networks of privilege to really take on this problem and take it on wholeheartedly because, to be honest, when caste exists at this level, everyone suffers. We need to do better as a society because we are facing so many different problems collectively. Anytime we diminish such a huge group of people the way that we diminish caste oppressed peoples, we are losing one of the most powerful resources that we have, which is each other. It is really time to put an end to and annihilate caste just like Dr. Ambedkar did. We are coming to the end of this podcast but Sam I want you to give the last words. You are such an incredible role model for many Dalits in diaspora both in terms of your activism, your technical prowess, but also your role as an inspiring father. I am wondering for our listeners out there what the last request you have in terms of people working together to stop this problem. Sam: This issue is close to my heart. I am doing what I can do in my limited capacity. In the professional environment I have to be careful, and avoid sounding pro-Ambedkar or pro any of our other icons as doing so might hurt me professionally. First thing I would advise anybody who is doing activism to go among the people but in the professional environment, I think people on the top, the upper castes, are still not so progressive that they will understand where you are coming from. They may think you are attacking their traditions. So I would say the best thing you can do in the professional environment is be the best. If you become the best at what you are doing your company cannot leave you. So just be your best and then go and educate the masses. Go outside your professional environment and do ten times more than what you are doing now. There are very few people, probably 100,000 people, at the top jobs so if one Dalit loses his job more than the person and his family, the community gets impacted. Keep the bigger picture in mind. To my upper caste friends, I would say you have to be understanding that if you are not going for annihilation of caste, you are doing harm to yourselves also, and definitely to the country. The whole country is going to lose if you think that caste is not a big problem and if you restrict your understanding of caste to only reservation. If you end the reservation, the caste system will end. Caste system is the root disease and not reservation. Reservation is only the medicine that was brought in to cure the disease or annihilate the caste at a certain point. We have to work together to make a caste-free India and a caste-free world. You might have to do a little more to annihilate caste from this world sooner than later. We are not asking for favors, we are asking for what any human being deserves which is a society where the checks and balances are put in such a way that there is no way that people can discriminate on the basis of caste. Give value to the work we are doing. Give us a workplace that is safe from caste-based discrimination. Look at our diversity proportion and reflect if this diversity is reflected in all fields. Just like today we are thinking about gender representation we also have to think about caste representation. Dalits comprise 15 percent of the population, OBCs are 52 percent of our population and scheduled tribes make up 8 percent of the population, is this diversity reflected in your bodies? Even though Brahmins in our country are a numerical minority they occupy 90 percent of all sea- shoot (ph) positions. Corporations which only focus on the stories of upper caste Indians and refuse to encourage participation from larger society, you will not capture the Indian market as you will miss 90 percent of the population. They need to stop looking at India from the lens of Brahmins and start looking at the country through the lens of those who comprise 90 percent of this countryтАЩs population. Organisations must ask themselves if they are approaching the Indian market with a team that is truly diverse. And my Jai Bhim salute to you. Mari, Thenmozhi and you guys are doing such a wonderful job, and the whole of your team. My best wishes to you. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity. Thank you! Thenmozhi: No, absolutely Sam. I mean, the thing is, we are all in this together. We are all here as Dalit in the diaspora holding the line and the only thing that I would add to SamтАЩs wonderful comments is that whatтАЩs really important, is that too often dominant caste people act as if Dalits are coming with a begging bowl when we are asking for our rights. And I just want to make it clear to people that we are not asking for anything. We just want you guys to stop acting out of privilege. Stop exploiting and stop discriminating against us and behave as proper human beings. The reality is that we have to take structural measures to ensure our equity because of how powerful, complicit and unbearable caste hegemony is in all these institutions. Sam shared a testimony of how a young woman from our community set fire to herself in a casteist educational institution. If the conditions are this bad, we need to do something differently as a society and that is really the call to action we had hoped to inspire with the Caste in the United States survey. I think with the CISCO case, we have such a huge opportunity in the United States to really lead the front of this conversation in a market where dominant castes are not in power. One thing that I have said interview after interview is that we need to credit the State of California for doing something that the Indian government has not done for decades, which is to ensure and have a very public debate about question of caste discrimination in workplaces and other American institutions. So if the CISCO case continues and there is a win, it will be a win not just for John Doe but it will be a critical step towards adding caste as a protective category which we need in all of American institutions. Then also a call for action for all these corporations to begin to build their caste competency. They can start by training HR departments and managers, what caste is and how to spot caste discrimination and to basically move forward to creating inter-caste work places with equity. Some of the stuff that Sam mentioned, which includes stopping the violence - which doesnтАЩt go far enough when we know these companies have done very deep investments for diversity and inclusion measures that also include scholarships, coaching and pathways of progress for those who are from other minority backgrounds. At this point we need to see those same investments for caste oppressed people because the time is now. And as Sam said, this is also proper business sense because if you want to capture the next billion users, the next billion users in South Asia are actually caste oppressed. So it is best to actually have caste oppressed technologists to shape that agenda, to be able to drive collaborations with our community so that we can wise all boats. I leave folks with these thoughts. I want to thank everyone for participating. Sam, thank you again for joining us and all our listeners for tuning in. We hope to see you in our next episode and until then, Jai Bhim.

According to news reports Sandeep Dohre, and his brother were thrashed by a group of 15 men who also set their house on fire.

According to news reports the then ruling Congress and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party had hit out at each other following the incident.

Video Editor: Ashutosh BhardwajVideo Producer: Maaz Hasan I, Raj Kumar Singh, was sacked from the post of Assistant Professor at Bundelkhand University just because I went for training at IIT Guwahati. I was discharged from continuing my duty in June on disciplinary grounds. The NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) training program that I took was intended to train the teacher in advanced technology, like machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence et al. Despite getting my leaves sanctioned and arranging the lectures to be given in my absence, from 2 to 14 March, I was served with a show-cause notice on 17 March and my salary was deducted. There were two other professors from the university who attended the NASSCOM training, but they werenтАЩt dealt with in the way I was. On 23 June, order to disengage me from my services was passed and a signed copy was given to me by Prof SK Katiyar. I wrote letter after letter to everyone, from the governor to chief minister and the education minister. When their offices sought a report on the matter, they (University) always submitted a false reply. With no options left, I moved to the Allahabad High Court for justice. My family and I are being harassed, both mentally and financially. I have not been paid for five months. The Allahabad High Court ruled in the favour of Singh. The court, in its order, said, тАЬthis is not a case of such a misconduct or disobedience which can warrant the maximum punishment of termination of service and, accordingly, the resolution of the Board of Governor dated 16 June 2020 and consequential order dated 23 June 2020 are hereby set aside.тАЭ However, the two-year contract of Singh expired on 30 September and the court verdict doesnтАЩt bind the university to renew RajтАЩs contract. When The Quint reached out to Professor Katiyar, he said that SinghтАЩs leaves had not been sanctioned. However, the university admits to extending contracts of other employees. тАЬHis contract expired on 30 September. People working before that were given an extension to teach temporarily. Their names would be nominated in the meeting of the Board of Governors and later, would be confirmed.тАЭ Professor Katiyar said.

The CPI(M) (often called CPM), she said in her Facebook post, has been continually harassing her in the name of caste. Tired of waging the lone battle, she has now made the decision to break free from the shackles of caste by converting to Islam. Stating that she had to learn more about the religion before converting, she said she hadnтАЩt decided when to embrace Islam yet. тАЬSome people have offered to help me with these learnings.

Meanwhile, she warned people against troubling her further with allegations of тАШlove jihadтАЩ, adding that all she wished was to live peacefully. Chithra Lekha made headlines after she fell into a dispute with the union leaders when working as an autorickshaw driver at Edatt in Payannur. She had conducted agitations alleging that CPM activists are not allowing her to continue with her livelihood. Following this, some people torched her autorickshaw. Finally, Chithra Lekha shifted to a rented house at Kattambally in Kannur. But the CPM men continue to attack her in the new place too.  Rushda Fathima Khan is the Staff Reporter for The Cognate.

Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize Author тАУ Dr Amritpal Kaur Although Punjab has a rich tradition of literature, the entire genre of identity literature is blind to gender and has strongly refused to engage with Dalit women. If we carefully observe, we realize that this missing of gender is systematic and innate in the understanding of Dalit assertion. The Dalit assertion is the assertion of a man and is most noticeable in Punjabi songs like putt chamaaran de (sons of chamaars) which is blatantly masculine. Blocking of gender in historical context has made Dalit women of Punjab almost invisible in literature as well. Sant Ram Udasi and LAL Singh Dil remain the icons of social protest, who have tried to express the silent pain and humiliation of their women through their poems. A passage from Sant Ram UdasiтАЩs long poem titled тАШAbode of the LabourersтАЩ is as below:- тАЬWhere all the roads are shut Where the dove is beset by crows Where unwed girls become mothers Where daughters sigh in grief Keep shining, O bright sun, on the abode of labourers.тАЭ Omprakash GhasoтАЩs novel Mitti da Mul (the worth of soil) holds a special place in Dalit Punjabi literature for producing the first Dalit female protagonist (fictitious) of Punjab, Mindo Bazigarni who dares the Jat Sikh landlord for his promiscuous offer of collecting fodder from his farm. This novel was later in the 1980s turned into a play by Gursharan Singh, a Punjabi play writer. In fact, it was in his plays that Punjabi Dalit women protagonists made their entry into public theatres which created a large female audience and gave them a chance to get out of their private spaces into public spheres. Mindo Bazigarni, Sheelo Ghumiyaran, Surjit Kaur Sarpanchni are SHE Heroes in Dalit bastis. Women mobilized in big numbers for these late evening cultural performances. Gurdial Singh in Anne Ghode da Daan (alms for the blind horse), succeeds in conveying the humiliation seethed by a Dalit woman after she returns to the four walls of her crumbling house from the fields where she had to hear insults for a few stalks of mustard from the landlord. Later on she walks out in the blind streets in the middle of the night to avoid what she feels as suffocation. Dalip Kaur Tiwana, a non-Dalit, writes in her novel, Eho Hamara Jiwana (this our life) that a poor Dalit woman has no kith or kin, once they are sold (even for a little money) she lives in an island of the social outcaste, even in the small village she belongs to none. Socially and individually, she doesnтАЩt exist, only floats. Female Dalit singers of Punjab have also suffered the same fate of exclusion from the mainstream entertainment. Folk legendary singer Narinder Bina gave a tough competition to upper caste female singers of her time like Surinder Kaur and Gurmeet Bawa. It is said that Narinder Biba was a far better singer in qualitative terms than her competitors but was given fewer opportunities in terms of technology. Bibi Nooran was another prolific Sufi singer of Punjab with a mesmerizing and powerful voice. Owing to patriarchal society and extreme poverty she wasnтАЩt allowed to pursue her career in singing but few of her songs available today are still matchless and captivating. None of the present-day singers, both male and female belonging to upper castes, stand a chance in matching their powerful voices. Swaraj Nooran, daughter of Bibi Nooran, followed her motherтАЩs dream, despite strong opposition from family and society. Her daughterтАЩs, popularly known as Nooran sisters, have created a mark for themselves in the Punjabi music industry which is male and Jat oriented. Another promising singer Ginni Mahi, has been able to make her presence felt by confidently embracing her identity of a Chamar. She praises Dr B. R. Ambedkar and Guru Ravidas through her revolutionary songs. Amrita Pritam, Ajit Kaur, Sujhwinder Amrit and many more women writers from Punjab have successfully expressed the feelings of humiliation, inferiority, anguish, love, desire, in their writings but none could touch the humiliation caused by the intersection of caste, class and gender. Bahujan Andolan is a socio-cultural political movement in North India. Many Dalit women of Punjab have actively participated from the genesis of movement becoming more than mere cultural participants. Sheela Rani remained active in Majha, Malwa and Doaba regions, Darshna Devi fought assembly elections from Mukerian constituency in 2007 and stood third (earning her the title of Mayawati of Punjab), Nirmala Dasua fought the assembly election from Gardhiwala in 2002, Rachna Devi from Phagwara was the general secretary of BSP, Harvinder Kaur, (daughter of Tajinder Singh Jhalli who was the chief of BAMCEF) participated in historical cycle march of 1984 from Delhi to Jammu along with Kanshiram, Manjinder Kaur from Patiala, Hardev Kaur Shant from Jalandhar and Sawarna Kaur from Balachaur constituency remained the backbone of the political identity of Punjab Dalits have been struggling for upward mobility in caste hierarchy. Many Dalits have been able to shift occupationally from being agricultural labourers to low-income private jobs in beauty salons, private companies and other shops as helpers, waiters, etc. Many are bearing the fruits of reservation, a hard-won right by Babasaheb for his people. The betterment of their economic status has not produced any significant result in their social position as lack of cultural capital is a huge roadblock. The educated Dalit youth is busy in the processes of Sanskritisation and migration. Migration is synonymous with the Punjabi culture despite the fact that Punjab has the most abandoned NRI brides. The NRIs, however, do not contribute to the upliftment of their community but squander their money in expressing newly gained class consciousness. They rejoice in their false pride in being able to spend like Upper caste Jats. In their aspirations for upward mobility and adoption of high-status cultures, educated Dalit women are seen enforcing ideas of development and modernity. Retro modernity is constructed at the outskirts of normative modernity for most of the Dalit community, who lack the purchasing power like the upper castes and cannot engage in consumption to claim modernity like them. They continue to fluctuate between rurality and modernity without being able to belong to either of identities. The educated Dalits blindly emulate the upper caste behaviour adopting more conservative norms around womenтАЩs behaviour which upholds female seclusion (dalitisation of patriarchy). Today, the educated and working Dalit women are nothing more than the producers of respectability (respectability hinges on the successful balance between work and home) and status despite being economically productive members of the families. Today, the Dalit women of Punjab are living two lives in extremity. First is the rural life marked by extreme poverty, deprivation, domestic and sexual abuse, crime, addiction, labelled as quarrelsome, vulgar, coarse, devoid of moral sense, sexually promiscuous and complete social exclusion. On the other side as the dutiful daughters and wives engaged in the work of status production. In both cases, they are rendered powerless by the family, society and culture, and their powerlessness is being reproduced by all these social structures. Punjabi Dalit women suffer from systematic silencing and have been widely under-represented in feminist discourses dominated by Jat women. They have no identity of their own and their Dalit identity is actually disempowering. Although they have been silenced in the mainstream, their bodies remember. The bodies of Dalit women of Punjab speak of their minds and memories. Their silent struggles are engraved in the furrows of their wrinkled faces and dried eyes; they only need to be touched upon through human endeavours. About the author тАУ Dr Amritpal Kaur, Institute of Ambedkar Studies, Jalandhar, Punjab Dr AmritPal KaurтАЩs тАЬDalits of Punjab тАУ Literature of Punjab Dalit WomenтАЭ is densely insightful article, it provides many new ideas for further research.

From that period the sweepers have been employed to ensure the municipal facility for the commuters. In the 18th century when the British Government established its new administration, it becomes necessary to employ a huge number of sweepers to clean up the city.  In that situation the then British Government pick up the Harijan community from northern India, in the then East Bengal to clean up the city. After the Independence of Bangladesh, the Sweeper community remains untouchable as they were under ancient Indian and Mughal administration. The views of the majority of people have not been changed, though they are engaged in the great profession of sweeping.  In Bangladesh with its Muslim majority, Hindus are a minority and Dalits are the most marginalized and deprived section of that minority community. They are considered тАЬuncleanтАЭ, living in their own neighborhoods apart from тАЬcleanтАЭ groups. Most Dalits, particularly among the Hindus, are descendants of Indians from other parts of what was British India, largely imported by the colonial regime to provide menial services.  They are denied entry to the temples, social centers, and burial grounds of non-Dalits. Like other countries of this world, the Harijan community lives in Bangladesh. Most of the time they are discriminated in our society. In every municipality, in our country, the Harijan community lives in specific places determined by the municipal authority. They involved in a novel profession like, cleaning up the city. Apart from municipal and City Corporation, they are also working in different Government, non-governmental offices, industries, schools, Courts, etc. offices to cleaning up the wastages. By inherently they are involved in the profession of sweeping so that they had never been involved in other professions. On the other hand, they cast differentiation among their community.  Basically, they are divided into seven cast groups. One group never participates in the cultural and social programmers of other lower casts community, even they do not take food with each other. One of the small parts of the whole population of Bangladeshi is the sweeper community. They are contributing to our development. Most importantly they helping to improve the conditions of the environment. From time immemorial they are discriminated against by the general people as well as the government.  In recent years the government has taken the task of developing their lifestyle, almost 50% of works already have been done, demolishing the old buildings of Dalit colonies & making modern 6 to 8 storied apartments.  I started my documentary on Dalits or these Dalit colonies of Dhaka, Also one of Naranganj in 2017 & still doing it, hope to continue it for 2 more years. The peoples of the colony love me, especially the kids. I like to think of myself as a part of them.               I am Saiful Amin Kazal, born 1969, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am an amateur photographer and I am doing photography from 1980. I am a private employee working in a construction company. During the тАЬPilkhana TragedyтАЭ (also called тАЬbdr mutinyтАЭ or тАЬbdr tragedyтАЭ) 2009, 25 February, while on the way to my workplace, I got stuck at Jigatola bus stand, very near to BDR (now its renamed тАЭ BGBтАЭ, Bangladesh border guard) 4# gate, they were openly firing to open place & running people with heavy machine guns & Chinese riffles, I had a sony digital pocket camera in my pant pocket (which I used to carry always) & I was taking pictures of them going or getting close to their gate, suddenly a bullet of a Chinese riffle shot me down, the bullet hit my left leg just above the knee, I was carried to govt hospital so soon by the public, my sciatic nerve was injured very seriously & my leg was broken into so many pieces. Total of 7 major operations have been done from 2009 to 2011, I went to Vellore CMC Hospital in 2012 also but nothing good happened. I was at bed rest for 4 & 1/2 long yrs (until 2014), now I can walk but with an elbow cratch & brase always in the leg, very sad to tell that in those time (2010 maybe) my hard disc was crashed which later I failed to recover, I lost all my images of 80тАЩs to 2009 Feb, I became so much frustrated that time. When I got a DSLR Camera for the 1st time in my life in 2015, I started my previous job again & started my photography life once again, with heavy pain of leg I never stopped, I never left home without my camera for a single day, I did my self project тАЬ365 ProjectтАЭ in 2018. I love street, lifestyle, portrait, documentary photography, I also love all kind of festivals, from late 2017, I am working on тАЬharijan/dalitтАЭ & also working on тАЬstranded PakistaniтАЭ (Bihari) in geneva camp & mirpur bihari camp. I am also doing some other documentary, such as тАЬtanneryтАЭ, тАЬplastic (flex)тАЭ and more. Photography is my hobby, my passion, my love.

The police said that four of the accused will be arrested. Botad police said that Sanjay Vaghela alias Chandrakant, a resident of Bagad village in Ranpur taluka, was attacked by six villagers on November 7 on his way back home from a nearby village. In the FIR, Vaghela has mentioned that he was beaten up with iron pipes by the accused, leaving his both arms and a leg fractured. He is admitted to a Bhavnagar hospital for treatment. Botad district superintendent of police Harshad Mehta told DH that the search is on to find two other accused. Vaghela has alleged in the FIR that one of the main accused Pradip Ghaghal allegedly conspired with others to beat him to force him to leave the village due to an old dispute and his dislike for me to sport a moustache, own and ride a horse in the village, Pradip conspired with other accused and beat me and hurled casteist slur,"" the FIR mentions Vaghela as saying. According to police, Vaghela and main accused Pradip, who belongs to the upper caste Kathi Darbar community, have filed at least six cases against one another in the last couple of years. Besides, Vaghela was facing a case of attempt to murder a State Reserver Police constable. Due to several cases against him, Vaghela was externed from the district for a year. He returned after completing a year only last month, a senior police officer said. Vaghela's cousin Manoj told DH over phone, ""Doctors have operated on my brother's arms and right leg.

"870",7544,"https://eshe.in/2020/11/25/justice-denied/","New Study Points to India├втВмтДвs Other Epidemic: Sexual Violence Against Dalit Women and Girls","eShe the female gaze eShe is a monthly magazine and blog based in India and Canada that amplifies womenтАЩs voices and stories about our shared humanity. A chilling new report by Swabhiman Society and Equality Now highlights how India's justice system is failing survivors of caste-based sexual violence. Even as India reels from the news of the Hathras gang-rape this September, a chilling report produced by Swabhiman Society, a grassroots organisation led by Dalit women, in collaboration with international womenтАЩs rights organisation Equality Now, has found conclusive evidence of how IndiaтАЩs justice system is failing survivors of caste-based sexual violence. The report titled Justice Denied: Sexual Violence & Intersectional Discrimination тАУ Barriers to Accessing Justice for Dalit Women and Girls in Haryana, India examines 40 rape cases involving women and girls from the Dalit community in IndiaтАЩs northern state of Haryana. It finds that not only are these women and girls more vulnerable to heinous forms of sexual violence тАУ such as gang-rape and murder тАУ than women from other communities, they are also less likely to get justice due to systemic prejudice, patriarchy and corruption. According to government data, around 10 Dalit women and girls are raped daily across India. However, the real figure is estimated to be far higher. тАЬThe stories featured in our report are horrific and heartbreaking, all the more so because of how the criminal justice system largely fails to act,тАЭ Jacqui Hunt, director of Equality NowтАЩs Eurasia office, tells eShe. тАЬPerpetrators of sexual violence and abuse know they are far less likely to face punishment if they commit a crime against a Dalit woman or girl because attacks are rarely investigated or prosecuted and conviction rates remain abysmally low. Society, law enforcement, and IndiaтАЩs unofficial justice system of village councils, called panchayats, all conspire to obstruct justice and rally in support of men who stand accused, particularly if they are from a dominant caste,тАЭ she avers. In over 80 percent of the cases in the study, all the accused persons involved in the case were from a dominant caste, and in over 90 percent of cases, at least one of the accused persons was from a dominant caste. Perpetrators often acted in groups and attacks tended to incorporate more severe forms of sexual violence, including gang-rape and murder, when it came to Dalit women and girls. In 97 percent of cases in Haryana, the offender was known to the victim. The highest number of victims came from the age group of 13 to 17 years old. Only 10 percent of cases examined ended with the successful conviction of all those charged, and this was just with particularly abhorrent crimes involving a victim who was murdered or under age six. Out of the 40 cases in the study, 62.5 percent are gang-rape cases, which is significantly higher than the 11-12 percent of gang-rapes in rape cases involving all women and girls in Haryana. тАЬThe high percentage of gang-rapes indicates how sexual violence against Dalit women and girls takes the form of a collective exercise of power and authority by dominant caste members,тАЭ says the report, work on which began in March 2020. Echoing the events of the Hathras gang-rape case тАУ where the Uttar Pradesh police burned the 19-year-old victimтАЩs body without her parentsтАЩ consent or knowledge after she was reportedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper-caste men known to her тАУ the report has also found that police frequently failed to record or investigate crimes when initially reported and were sometimes abusive or put pressure on survivors to drop cases. тАЬThe horrific gang-rape and death of a young Dalit woman in Hathras in September once again demonstrates the close relationship between sexual violence and IndiaтАЩs discriminatory caste system. Extreme instances of sexual violence and cruelty, such as the Hathras victim was subjected to, draw extensive media coverage and outrage in India. Meanwhile, there is little indication that real action is taken to address the common impunity for such crimes, nor to achieve positive, systemic change that ensures prevention of sexual violence and caste-based discrimination, and gives survivors access to justice,тАЭ says Hunt. Around 42 percent of rape cases in Haryana are dropped during the police investigation itself without charges being filed (compared with the national average of 15 percent rape cases being dropped). One of the reasons is that тАЬdue to pressure from high-level politicians to clamp down on caste-based atrocities within the state, district-level authorities aim to bring down the number of rape cases registered under the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (POA) Act,тАЭ says the report. This leaves the survivor with no access to the criminal justice system. Manisha Mashaal, who founded Swabhiman Society in 2012 to provide paralegal support and legal aid to survivors of sexual violence from marginalised communities, states: тАЬOne of the biggest challenges in cases of sexual violence is that survivors or the families are pressured into compromises with the accused. Another issue is the lack of quality and effective systems in place to provide the survivors of violence and their families with immediate social, legal and mental health support along with proper and timely rehabilitation.тАЭ Survivors in the study were not given adequate advice about their legal rights, and some did not receive compensation payments they were entitled to from the government. In fact, compensation was received by the rape victims only in seven out of the 37 cases in this study in which a police complaint had been filed, of which four were after either public outcry or court orders. Compensation was not received in 62 percent of the cases, while data is unknown for 18 percent of the cases. Survivors, family members, and witnesses also faced threats, coercion, and bribery from perpetrators and members of the wider community seeking to stop prosecutions. In over 80 percent of the cases, village councils attempted to interfere with the justice process by using their economic, social and political power to threaten, intimidate and coerce survivors and family members. In almost 60 percent of cases, the survivor or her family was pressured into withdrawing from pursuing a legal case and had to accept a тАШcompromiseтАЩ settlement outside the legal system. тАЬIn one case, a Dalit woman was raped by three dominant caste men including the Sarpanch (head) of the village. When the survivor went to the police station to register a FIR, she was threatened with sexual and physical assault in the police station itself by the perpetrators, and the Sarpanch threatened to banish her from the village if she pursued the complaint,тАЭ says the report. In 32.5 percent of the cases, the survivor and sometimes her family were forced to leave the village or neighbourhood due to the stigma surrounding the rape incident and/or community pressure. Hunt calls on IndiaтАЩs government and criminal justice system тАЬto take positive action to effectively address the epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence being inflicted on marginalised women and girlsтАЭ in India. Mashaal adds: тАЬIt is critical that the barriers to justice faced by Dalit women and girls at the ground level are brought to the attention of our society and government so that caste-based violence is recognised, space is created for Dalit voices to be heard, and collective action is taken towards ensuring justice to the survivors and their families.тАЭ Photos: Swabhiman Society and Equality Now Syndicated to Money Control Community manager, eShe, and visual artist.

Published: 17th November 2020 12:23 AM | Last Updated: 17th November 2020 12:25 AM | A+A A- M Kumar (36) is the only Dalit in a neighbourhood full of families from a dominant caste. (Photo | Express) TIRUPUR: In a shocking incident, a Dalit man residing in Uthukuli has alleged that he has been forced out of his village by his dominant caste neighbours. The Sundakadampalayam panchayat president has been accused of having had a role in the abuse, which included dragging the man to the police station with allegations of sexual harassment. M Kumar (36) is the only Dalit in a neighbourhood full of families from a dominant caste. The number had, however, not always been skewed against him. When he bought this 2.25 cents of land in Guruvayurappan Nagar from one Kousalya in 2013, there were mere five houses in the area. ""I was born and raised in Urumandapalayam near Kovundampalayam (near Coimbatore city). I was working as a construction worker for several years and then moved to the cattle business. Meanwhile, I decided to build a house in Uthukuli. I spent over Rs 1.5 lakh and built a small house,"" he recounts. Now, in a neighbourhood of over 100 families, Kumar was excluded from all social activities and pursuits. Matters came to a head when plans were drawn up for a Ganapathy Temple in the locality in 2017. While the neighbours pooled money for the construction, he was left out. ""When I questioned them, they claimed that it was because I do not belong to their caste. When I reported the incident to the then panchayat president, Rasathi, she stepped in and asked the neighbourhood group to include me in the proceedings. They refused to comply. So, she refused to give them permission to carry out the temple construction. This angered the group and led to them raising false allegations against me,"" claims Kumar. Since then, he's been subjected to casteist slurs, with people reportedly claiming that Dalits should not reside in the village and certainly not in their locality. On November 8, Kumar says that a group of people headed by Sundakadampalayam panchayat president Anand barged into his house, hurling casteist slurs and thrashed him and his 65-year-old mother Papal. ""They took me to Kunnathur police station and accused me of sexual crimes, saying that a person of such conduct cannot be a resident of the village. Even as I was at the station, they hired two vans and vacated my house of my belongings, my goats and cows, and my two bikes. The police personnel, too, threatened me, forced me in the van with my belongings and sent me to my brother's house outside the village (2.5 km away),"" he narrates. While he has submitted a petition at the district police headquarters, no action has been taken, he claims. Tirupur Collector K Vijaya Karthikeyan told The New Indian Express that he has instructed the police to conduct an inquiry into the incident and assured that action will be taken immediately. District Police Superintendent Disha Mittal, on her part, reiterated that this was a serious issue and said the case has been transferred to Kunnathur police station under a team headed by Deputy Superintendent of Police L Baskar.

This complaint has been redirected and transferred by the NHRC to the Uttar Pradesh Human Rights Commission (UPHRC) for consideration and necessary action. The complaint dated August 27, 2020 was placed before the Commission on November 6, 2020 and it was deemed by the NHRC that the subject matter of the complaint should be dealt with by the stateтАЩs Human Rights Commission. Accordingly, a scanned copy of the complaint has been forwarded to UPHRC on November 6, 2020. The incident occurred in Kunwarpur village, Bulandshahr district, Uttar Pradesh whereby a Dalit boy was brutally beaten up by 'upper caste' men for calling the mobile phone of one of the 'upper caste' men. The victim, Vishal called the mobile phone of Dipu Sharma, on July 9, to ask when he would come to pick up the Bajra crop when the call was answered by DipuтАЩs wife and she informed Vishal that Dipu was not at home and the conversation ended. The same night around 10 PM Dipu, along with his brothers, Mukesh and Mohit and two others, Sachin and Prashant came to the victimтАЩs house, and started hurling casteist abuses at him while asking why he had called and spoken to DipuтАЩs wife. Then they brutally beat him up black and blue with rods, sticks and cable wires so much so that his skin has peeled off. Dipu and others even threatened him that they would kill him.  Vishal, belonging to Chamaar community managed to file an FIR against the 'upper caste' men, but no arrests were made by the police. On the contrary, the accused men filed an FIR against Vishal falsely stating that he would speak obscene words over the phone to the accusedтАЩs wife and even beat up the upper caste men, for which Vishal was even arrested. The complaint points out the absurdity of the allegations being made by the upper caste men, тАЬIt is extremely pertinent to note here that Dipu belongs to an upper caste and a Dalit entering a BrahminтАЩs house and beating up family members has never been heard of; it is rather preposterous and unthinkable that such an incident should happen in the Indian society where caste is given such high regard and the divide so deep rooted.тАЭ The complaint further states, тАЬThe Dalit family is being intimidated by the upper castes and the police are also reluctant in taking action against the perpetrators belonging to upper caste who enjoy the support of other Brahmins of the villager including the Gram Pradhan.тАЭ In the light of the stark caste divide and caste hegemony prevalent in rural India that has come to the fore in the treatment of the family of the Hathras rape victim, it has become of utmost importance that the UPHRC take serious cognisance of this incident and bring justice to the Dalit youth, who after having suffered injuries had to also undergo incarceration.

SNS Web | Kolkata | November 5, 2020 3:27 pm Amit Shah in West Bengal on Thursday (L) and Firhad Hakim. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Firhad Hakim has hit out at BJP strongman and Union Home Minister of India, Amit Shah, for his тАЬdramaтАЭ of having lunch at the homes of Matua and Adivasi communities during his visit to West Bengal. Hakim, Minister of Urban Development and Municipal Affairs in West Bengal government, has said that Shah is trying to conceal the fact that Dalit and Adivasi girls are raped and burnt in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, hinting at the gang-rape incident and its aftermath in Hathras. тАЬIn Uttar Pradesh girls of Adivasi and Dalit communities are raped and burnt. The families are denied to even perform the last rites. Dalit girls are raped daily in UP and many Adivasis are being tortured regularly in BJP-ruled states,тАЭ Hakim was quoted as saying by ABP Ananda. тАЬAmit Shah is trying to hide all these with his drama. Not Matua, not Adivasi, BJP isnтАЩt there with anyone,тАЭ the Chairman of Board of Administrators, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) added. Hakim also highlighted the welfare schemes and development done by the Mamata Banerjee-led government for the marginalised communities in West Bengal. тАЬMamata Banerjee has developed the house of Matua matriarch Boro Ma. Mamata Banerjee has created the Matua board. Mamata Banerjee has created university for them. Thus, itтАЩs not possible that Amit Shah will come and only have lunch and Matuas will forget everything,тАЭ Hakim said. Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced distribution of 1.25 lakh land pattas to people settling in refugee colonies and setting up development boards for Matua and Adivasi communities for their socio-economic development. Handing over land pattas to refugees will establish their proof of residence along with ration cards as a counter to BJPтАЩs effort to win them over with citizenship award. Running up to the much-important Bengal Assembly Elections next year, both the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have made special efforts to woo the Matua voters, who are believed to be 3 crores in number in a state of around 10 crore population. Matua populace, a Dalit community in Bengal, were often considered close to Banerjee ever since she became the CM. However, the affiliation suffered a blow after BJP made a massive inroads into the Matua community during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Therefore, the Namashudra community has become hot property ahead of the next yearтАЩs Assembly Elections. The saffron camp is attempting to consolidate their strength further, while the ruling party is trying to regain the lost ground. <!-- e9 = new Object(); e9.size = ""300x250,300x600,160x600""; //--> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); ","IND","dalit",0,NA,NA,NA

DHARMAPURI: Tension prevailed in Harur on Monday, after the body of a 24-year-old Dalit youth from Tiruvannamalai was found near the banks of the Thennpennai river, bordering Tiruvannamalai and Harur. The family of the youth, identified as A Clinton from Ilanguni near Ammapettai, staged a road roko near Harur demanding justice. The family said Clinton, who was working in a private firm in Hosur, had been in love with a girl from Theerthamalai and feared he may have been killed because of the relationship. ClintonтАЩs body had washed up on the banks of the Thennpennai early Monday morning. Residents of Ammapettai, which borders Tiruvannamalai and Harur, spotted the body and alerted the police. According to police, the youth seemed to have been beaten to death as visible injury marks were seen on the body. The body was sent to the Harur government hospital for postmortem examination. Police speculated that the body was dumped in the area in the late hours of Sunday. They are yet to recover his mobile phone which is expected to provide crucial information. However, ClintonтАЩs family alleged that the police had recovered the phone and were trying to hide the truth. Following this, Harur Deputy Superintendent of Police Tamilmani met with the protestors and assured the family that the investigation will be conducted, the mobile phone would be found and justice will be served. Police registered a case and started investigations. Based on these assurances, the family withdrew the protest. Police said the road roko had disrupted traffic for over an hour.

"877",7569,"https://thelifeofscience.com/2020/11/12/museumization-dalit-experience/","A new woke academia & the museumisation of the Dalit experience","In conversation with Shalini Mahadev Back in Hyderabad after seven months, I was to meet Shalini Mahadev, a friend who I met during my masters in sociology from University of Hyderabad. Shalini is still at the university pursuing her PhD in biological sciences. The two of us have talked about caste willingly or unwillingly innumerable times and have always discovered new ways in which it affects us. Recent academic literature and journalism on casteism in higher education has thoroughly investigated the barriers facing students from marginalised sections while entering these spaces or trying to stay in them. The web of identities one constantly travels in also shapes oneтАЩs experience of these academic spaces. We had decided to meet in front of the university and drive through the campus, which we call (and think of) as ours. We thought we could enter from one end and exit through the other end of the campus to avoid a longer route to ShaliniтАЩs home. We knew that it would be a little tricky as people are barred from entering the university premises given the ongoing pandemic. But as past and present students at this university who are familiar with the guards, we expected to find a way to convince them. Shalini explained to one of them that she has a permit to enter the premises for her lab work. But the guard did not let us in, and asked for the written permit, which was wrecked in the rain. So there we were, at the gate of a university we both are part of, literally trying to enter the university, charged with ideas to share with each other about gatekeeping in Indian academia, thinking about universities as spaces we manage to infiltrate. It was a funny momentтАФwe were stopped by the security forces, and we did end up taking the longer route. When we were finally at ShaliniтАЩs home, we had the following conversation where we attempted to uncover the logic with which caste, gender and other identities produce тАШdifferencesтАЩ among the general community of students and scholars. The boy I was made to sit with was very good at studies and I wasnтАЩt. My teacher made me sit with him so I would learn from him and become better at my studies. I remember him uttering his category with such pride, enunciating the word тАШgeneralтАЩ so clearly. Vaishali: We access higher education with an aim to move upwards in life, right? One can say that the decision of stepping into these institutions is aspirational; we want to change our reality. But these institutions have different ways to remind us of our identities. Shalini: Initially, I felt like an equal in most academic/research spaces, and that is how I want to feel. It is these institutions that keep reminding me of caste and other hierarchies. Felt experiences of inequalities have been perpetually shoved in my face through these institutions. I remember even in school they had once asked for the students from SC/ST category to be identified. I was the only student to stand in the SC category. I came back and told my parents thinking it was a good thing to be the only student. They burst out laughing! Vaishali: It is very weird that I also remember a similar moment very vividly. I think I was in class 8 or 9 when they had called out students to know their caste category for board registration, I think. I have a visual memory of that day; I remember where I was sitting that day, how the class was set and even the teacher who asked me. The boy I was made to sit with was very good at studies and I wasnтАЩt. My teacher made me sit with him so I would learn from him and become better at my studies. I remember him uttering his category with such pride, enunciating the word тАШgeneralтАЩ so clearly. Shalini: I was once in a coaching centre preparing for medical entrance tests because I wanted to be a doctor. It was a challenging and competitive environment where people studied all day and night. We used to get a 15-minute break to eat. I learnt about reservations at that time. They used to directly and unashamedly ask SC students to stand in the class and tell their ranks. They would compare my marks and rank with other upper-caste girlsтАЩ and remark that she would not get the same college as I would with the same rank as mine. This is just one of the several instances where I was humiliated in the coaching centre. The atmosphere was extremely competitive. Travelling to and from this centre was so hectic. I spent so much time hopping from one bus to another that I hardly got any time to read. People would come in their cars with their packed lunches. If I had that kind of time, I remember thinking that I would definitely outsmart them. Commuting to these places at all kinds of odd hours, even early mornings, didnтАЩt feel safe. I have been harassed so many times. I have noticed it is also about us Dalit girls and the way we are seen by men on the streets. Brahmin women carry this тАЬgood family-girlтАЭ image, which men can see. They laugh differently and they look different. Their skin colour and faces are a certain way, they wear certain types of clothes and their hair is a certain way. Vaishali: When I entered my college for my undergraduate degree in Delhi University, coming from a really small district and a lower-caste background, it was a very challenging time for me and my mental health. While entering elite universities, the first thing that stares right at you is the alienation. It was a completely alienating atmosphere where you relate to nothing and no one. I could not relate to my peers, didnтАЩt know how to participate in conversations, did not get any jokes, or even the language that they used. The courses would be in a language that is too difficult to understand. I feel that in the social sciences, there is this heavy use of jargon, which is used to make students from reservations feel stupid, inadequate and unfit. Consequently, I had terrible social anxiety and I still do, every time I enter a new institution. Despite reservations, I do not think that universities are equipped to enable SC/ST students to sustain themselves. Vaishali: It is interesting how upper-caste people think that we donтАЩt study or we are lazy, when we have to do double the work. I went to a popularly progressive college but students wouldnтАЩt shy away from asking if one is a тАЬreservation candidateтАЭ. I had a terrible inferiority complex. Though I was very much interested in literature, I would not speak in class. However, I would keep reading and trying to write good assignments, just because I did not want to be called a тАЬreservation candidateтАЭ. I felt like I had to read and write so much and so wellтАФanything less than that was just not enough. We put ourselves under such pressure and unreal expectations just to burst these myths about reservations. We internalise so much guilt. Even though one changes the language, how much does the hierarchy change in the actual sense? Existing hierarchies in the labs, like between interns, JRFs, PhD students, postdocs and the supervisors, are fixed even though we call each other by first names. Shalini: I was working as a junior research fellow (JRF) in an institute which had liberal workplace ethics. They would ask us to not address the professors as Sir/MaтАЩam, but insist on first names. It took me so much time to get used to this. Even though one changes the language, how much does the hierarchy change in the actual sense? Existing hierarchies (and the socially contracted power dynamics between them) in the labs, like between interns, JRFs, PhD students, postdocs and the supervisors, are fixed even though we call each other by first names. Vaishali: I agree. It does not really impact much. Do you think it has to do with this culture of political correctness and insistence on changing the language rather than a bigger and a more difficult transformation of material everyday hierarchies? Shalini: I think political correctness, mannerisms and language also are so elite and diplomatic. What we have been taught at homes is the language which is тАЬroughтАЭ and which gets things done. My language is very Hyderabadi. People say Hyderabadi is abrasive due to colloquial way of speaking/lack of honorifics, and usually, it is also very easily written off as being тАЬimpoliteтАЭ and тАЬuncivilisedтАЭ. It took me time and effort to even improve my Hindi and English. Even in school, there were kids who used to read novels in 8th or 9th standard. If my parents caught me reading a novel at that age, they would have asked if I have totally given up on studies or what! I will be honest: I could not inculcate the habit of reading. Even in science, there is so much information and data to mug up that there is little scope of creativity. So what if the language I use is simply to communicate my issues and problems plainly. Neither do I understand these language problems, nor do I have the time for it. I have been told that I do not know how to speak. I do not understand what they mean. I know English pretty well, I have no problem in comprehending English; then, what is it that I canтАЩt speak? Vaishali: Is it that you do not know how to speak? I think, rather, we do not have the language that will validate the elite majority. I think they expect us to talk in a way where we are responsible for maintaining the hierarchy and making them feel better generally. If our sentences do not deal with them and instead focus on us and our problems only, it seems impolite. I have faced similar issues; I always felt separated from my peers as well as my professors. I did not know how to socialise with them. I have felt that in the social sciences, there is so much influence of informal тАЬhanging outтАЭ with the professors. It is almost like a diluted form of corruption where one needs to have a certain rapport or networks, which are formed by having similar interests with professors and peers that are outside the domain of the discipline you are studying. I have just never been able to do that. Every time I am in a class or a conference, I can never go and talk, not because I do not know the language but because I do not share the same sensibilities. I do not even share those mannerisms which are produced, consumed and enforced by these elite classes only. Shalini: Entering university, especially with the recent trend of political correctness, has made language more calculative for me. When you come to campus, you are taught so many things politically (and generally). I have been lucky that my friends took the time to explain many things to me. At least in science, terms are easy to understand. On the other hand in humanities and the social sciences, the terms are, in fact, concepts, which are so difficult to grasp. They have multiple meanings in varied contexts. I have realised that even within this space, academicians cannot simplify the terms. Even after learning, there is so much anxiety from conversation to conversation. The more you know, the more anxiety one has to deal with. Vaishali: Yes, I agree. Even the increasing discussions on caste in university campuses have a dual effect. Caste has recently become a popular topic of discussion, and I cannot help but think whether it has to be a dominant discourse or a trend for people to participate in a serious discussion about caste or Dalit feminism. Even when caste becomes a mainstream topic of discussion, the baton must still remain with Dalits who have been talking about it and living it much before the media considered it as something important. Before a year or two, if I would bring up caste, a majority of times I would be told that I bring caste into discussions where it doesnтАЩt belong or does not simply exist. Now, it is the same people who are posting pictures of Ambedkar on their social media. It is amusing actually how people are directed according to the media discourse. I wonder how long it will last. I havenтАЩt really seen it, but I want to see how two Brahmin women in academia will talk about caste, maybe about how being a Brahmin has benefitted them in academic spaces, and how Brahminical patriarchy has affected their growth. Shalini: I remember you talking about a professor who would immediately pick you when talking about caste. Now, with all these discussions on caste, again it is a burden put on us where we must talk about caste, and caste only. Vaishali: I remember, yes. It used to be so frustrating! Every time someone would utter the word тАЬcasteтАЭ or тАЭDalitтАЭ, he would take my name and ask my opinion. You are reduced to a Dalit student, a Dalit scholar or a Dalit friend. Sometimes, I do not want to engage in these discussions only because I know it simply means more to me than to them, and I know the effect it will have on me. тАЬWokeтАЭ or performative culture has provided the progressive upper castes with tokenism which gives easy gratification. How we suffer from this is evident by being a token, but apart from that, if you have once been given that tag, you cannot rise above it. Although it is true that I study caste and it affects me directly and materially, I also read other things apart from caste and gender that I am equipped to talk about. I also sometimes feel that a discussion on caste is not just a discussion for us. It takes so much emotional investment sometimes to talk about caste. There are times when I have felt that the only way to engage in the discussion is to share a personal detail, which is often about a triggering moment where my caste was highlighted. It is like your engagement always comes at a cost of sharing something excruciatingly difficult. Shalini: It is, because for them, it is just a discussion they are a part of. It takes such a toll on mental health. Many times these discussions have been with me after they have happened. They will forget it the minute it is over just because it is not really a matter of identity or existence for them. For us, it gets in the way of how we function, and we spend two days thinking about what happened and playing it in our head again and again. Vaishali: It is not them who is being talked about. ThatтАЩs so true! At my home, nobody sits and talks about being a Dalit. Everyone is familiar with that. They will talk about Brahmins and Savarnas. We will joke about their mannerisms, their habits and their hollow pride. But in academics, we are always the subjects who are being talked about. It is like a museumisation of experience itself. Shalini: A friend of mine told me once that when we go in their space and give a talk, we become their subjects. They will always look at us in a setting where we are subjects from whom knowledge has to be gathered, but we ourselves do not have much knowledge. We should sit and study them instead! But, who would fund such a study anyway? But coming back, I also know that I do talk about myself. I came to know more things when I was once asked to write an article. But I could not just write about my experiences, I had to constantly justify and give names to refer in order to validate those experiences. I might not want to say all of everything. Basically, they wanted me to write in a certain way. It means even the process of studying me will be in their own way and the way they agree upon. They talk so much about individuality and subjectivity, but I donтАЩt know how that works out. Vaishali: It is so true. Especially in the social sciences, any study on caste readily translates into incessantly researching Dalits. Even now, it is you and I who are talking about being Dalit and a woman. I havenтАЩt really seen it, but I want to see how two Brahmin women in academia will talk about caste, maybe about how being a Brahmin has benefitted them in academic spaces, and how Brahminical patriarchy has affected their growth. I feel there are so many interesting questions to deal with in the world of upper castes. I have noticed this a lot lately. Even when we read anti-caste literature, Ambedkar and Periyar begin the study of the caste stratified society by examining the тАЬbrahmin-non-brahminтАЭ divide. Phule also conceptualises the caste society in terms of Shetji-Bhatji. Meaning, these theorisations have been written by taking the Upper Castes as the subject of study. However, when academic spaces began and when one studied early as well as contemporary sociological studies about castes in India, we see these studies being done on Dalits by upper castes. So something must have changed during the conception of academics where this focus of becoming subjects shifted and Dalits were made the subjects of the knowledge created instead of being the agencies that created academic and theoretical knowledge which stemmed from the anti-caste politics itself. Thank you for these conversations with you, Shalini. Now, this is not the first time we have talked about academic spaces in such detail so I also feel like there was so little we could actually record through this article. The issues that one faces are never-ending, hence the things we could cover in this article are limitless. The ways in which universities as spaces and higher education, in general, have compounded the identities like caste and gender is very interesting to observe. We both feel that the nature of these conversations must be dialectic with an aim to form newer and more nuanced discussions around academic spaces.

Published: 14th November 2020 09:04 AM | Last Updated: 14th November 2020 11:55 AM | A+A A- Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal PATNA: Amid buzz that the BJP may opt for veteran Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal as the new deputy chief minister instead of incumbent Sushil Kumar Modi, the Bihar NDA held its first meeting after the elections on Friday. The speculation strengthened after hundreds of supporters of Chaupal raised slogans demanding his elevation as deputy CM, upon his arrival at the Patna airport. Chaupal is one of the 15 members of a trust set up on the directions of the Supreme Court to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya. He was also accorded the rare honour of performing the first Shilanyas тАФ laying the first brick in the foundation for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on November 9, 1989 тАФ as part of the Sangh ParivarтАЩs social engineering. He coined the slogan тАШRam with RotiтАЩ, melding faith with livelihood. However, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may not be comfortable with a new deputy. тАЬSushil Modi may not have a wide vote bank but he is well experienced in running ministries like finance,тАЭ some NDA leaders opined. As for Sushil Modi, the speculation is he could be sent to the Rajya Sabha on the seat that fell vacant after the demise of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan. Propping up Chaupal could also help the BJP build a Dalit vote bank to occupy the space vacated by LJP chief Chirag Paswan. For his part, Chaupal said he had no official word on any new assignment within the government or the party. Later in the day, Nitish submitted his resignation. An NDA meeting on Sunday will take the process of government formation forward. ALSO WATCH: O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

National Coalition for Strengthening SCs & STs PoA Act and National Dalit Movement for Justice- NCDHR strongly condemns the judgement delivered by the HonтАЩble Supreme Court in the above mentioned case as it weakens the roots of fight against untouchability. We would like to further reiterate that the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was framed to prevent atrocities committed against the Dalit and Adivasi communities. The research data from various source reveals that the тАЬActтАЭ has not been properly implemented. Still there is a large fragment of people belonging to the marginalised community for whom ensuring access to justice is still remains a dream. In most of the cases, people belonging to Dalit or Adivasi community do not even report the due to fear of social boycott or other form of atrocity by the dominant castes. The PoA Act is intended to serve and protect the rights of Dalit and AdivasiтАЩs. However it has been observed that a number of attempts have been made to dilute its provisions. The judgment delivered in the above mentioned criminal appeal is one such attempt. The judgment will form the base of gross social injustice to the marginalised and vulnerable communities. It is only due to the constant struggle of few civil society organisation and Dalit and Adivasi leaders, the act is still into existence. As per the facts of the case, A Dalit man raised his voice against forceful and illegal land possession by the dominant caste members. The Dalit man and his family members were constantly being threatened and subjected to atrocity. The FIR was lodged for the offences under Sections 452, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The police filed its report of investigation and removed Section 3(1)(e) from the charge sheet. The accused later filed an application under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code for quashing of FIR.The appeal made by the accused came before the apex court and the HonтАЩble court, while quashing the FIR, reiterated that тАЬThis act intended to punish the acts of the upper casteтАЭ and this case had no connection with the caste (Scheduled Caste) of the complainant. Both the complainant and the accused person have the right to own the land and get justice. Since the incident occurred within four walls in the absence of members of the public, the allegation under the act do not stand and hence the section 3 (1) (r) cannot be applicable to this case as highlighted in his judgment. The HonтАЩble Court has ignored few of the most important legal aspects while delivering the judgment. The same are as follows: 1. The police authorities, at the initial phase of the investigation, had failed to invoke sections 3 (1) (u) and 3 (2) (va) of SC/ST Act 1989 in the said FIR. The facts of the case clearly attract these provisions. In particular, when the FIR is registered under IPC sections, the police authorities are also bound to include section 3 (2) (va) of SC/ST PoA Act. Moreover since the FIR is registered under 506 of IPC, so it is obvious that section 3 (2) (va) of SC/ST PoA Act is applicable. But the HonтАЩble Court did not consider these legalities of the case and rendered a judgment which is against the principle of Social Justice. 2. Moreover section 8 of the SC/ST PoA Act, 1989 talks about presumption as to offence. Sub Clause (c) of Section 8 further says that тАЬthe accused having personal knowledge of the victim or his family, the Court shall presume that the accused was aware of the caste or tribal identity of the victim, unless the contrary is provedтАЭ. The apex court has failed to look into this significant feature of the act. 3. Finally the HonтАЩble court has ignored the basic principle set up under the Object and Reason clause of the act, i.e., the Act was enacted to improve the social economic conditions of the vulnerable sections of the society as they have been subjected to various offences such as indignities, humiliations and harassment. Even if a member of Schedule caste or Schedule Tribe is being verbally caste abused by the member of Dominant Caste, under the pretext of his caste identity, the act amounts to humiliation, harassment and violation of Article 21, i.e., Right to Life and Personal Dignity. Since, the HonтАЩble court has failed to consider the above mentioned aspect and has grossly erred in rendering the said impugned judgment, National Dalit Movement for Justice would like to put forth following demands in order to prevent miscarriage of justice: 1. The HonтАЩble apex Court shall reconsider the appeal by taking suo-moto cognizance and transfer the same to a constitutional bench for consideration 2. The State shall file a review petition in order to ensure that the victims have access to justice; 3. Action shall be taken against the concerned police authorities under the section 4 (wilful negligence) of the SC/ST PoA Act for including inappropriate sections and diluting the gravity of the incident and for favouring the accused person. We, on behalf of the National Coalition for Strengthening SCs & STs PoA Act (NCSPOA) will take every possible step to emphasizing upon our demands and to take action on reinstating the SC/ST PoA Act.

The girl, who suffered major injuries during the attempt to take her life, died at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, where she was under treatment. It was last Saturday that the teen, who is a native of Nariyampara in Kattappana, tried to take her life at her house. A few days prior to the incident, the family had filed a complaint against an auto driver in the region, stating that he sexually assaulted her. The man allegedly sexually assaulted her after falsely promising to be in a relationship with her. The girl, who was first rushed to a local hospital in the region, was then transferred to Kottayam Medical College. From there, she was taken for specialist treatment to Medical College Hospital in the state capital. Though her condition was slightly improving, her health further deteriorated on Saturday and she succumbed, reports Malayala Manorama. The accused, identified as Manu Manoj, was arrested only after the girl attempted suicide. Though there were reports that there has been a delay in arresting the accused, police officials of Kattappana station had told TNM that he was absconding. The 24-year-old accused was booked on charges on rape and various offences under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) and on charges of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The accused was a member of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), youth wing of the CPI(M). He was removed from the party after his name surfaced in the case. The DYFI leaders in Idukki had told TNM that the accused was not holding any leadership positions in the party and was just a member.

"890",7656,"https://www.kractivist.org/fact-finding-attack-on-dalit-colony-in-telangana-during-dussehra-was-planned/","Fact Finding - Attack on Dalit colony in Telangana during Dussehra was planned - Kractivism","POSTED ON NOVEMBER 13, 2020 Two weeks after caste Hindus attacked a Dalit colony ove the celebration of Dusshera festival in Ramojipeta of Siricilla in Telangana, an independent fact-finding committe from the Voice of Dalit Collective said that the attack was part of a тАЬcaliculated conspiracyтАЭ against Madiga families. The committee led by Prof K Lakshminarayana, Assistant Professor Dr Balaboyina Sudharshan and Dr Pasunuri Ravinder visited the village and interacted with the victims and officials earlier this week. Earlier in October, on the night of the Dasara a feud that began over loud music being played at the Dalit colony ended in violence. Over 200 men and women belonging to Mudhiraj caste attacked Dalits leaving many injured, including Upa Sarpanch (Deputy Sarpanch), who is a Dalit, alleged activists. The fact-finding report compared the violence to the 1991 attack on Dalits in Tsunduru of Andhra Pradesh. тАЬThere was no loss of life, but there is damage to properties and self-respect of Dalits,тАЭ it stated. The report further said, тАЬWhen we hear about attacks on Dalits, we assume the perpetrators are from upper castes/dominant castes, but here in this case it was a BC community who embodied the casteism of dominant castes.тАЭ According to the activists, Mudhiraj community which constitutes over 90 families have politically marginalised the 34 Dalit families by unanimously electing a person who belongs to their caste as Sarpanch, while giving the Upa Sarpanch post to a Dalit. Caste tensions over installing a statue a couple of years ago had flared up the recent incident, found the activists. According to the fact-finding committee, Dalits and the Mudhiraj members resolved to set up statues of Dr BR Ambedkar and Jyothirao Phule. However, a religious group тАШconspiredтАЩ and brought in a proposal to install the Chatrapati Shivaji statue instead of Dr Amebedkar, alleged activists. The report stated that there were attempts made to destroy the foundation stone of the Ambedkar statue and in turn Dalits filed a case against members of the BC community. тАЬInfuriated by this assertion they have targeted each of Dalit,тАЭ stated the report. The activists said that the caste Hindu MudhirajтАЩs allegedly barred Dalits from attending Dasara celebrations. тАЬDalits have celebrated Dasara in their colony by setting up a music system and playing Bathukamma in their colony. They couldnтАЩt digest the fact that they are celebrating or wearing new clothes soon. The Sarpanch and other persons from the community complained about the disturbance due to the music system. When Dalits questioned their intervention, it led to an argument, which culminated in attacks on the colony.тАЭ Prof Lakshminarayana and team further stated that the reason behind the sustained grudge against Dalits is because families are educating their children despite the historical oppression and economic problems. According to the fact-finding team, the Dalit colony has seven postgraduates and over 15 graduates and several people with small jobs, this was disliked by caste Hindu villagers. The activists said, тАЬIt is very rare to say Madiga community people assert themselves socially and politically in Telangana. This was not liked by the Mudhiraj community, which is why they attacked Dalits saying тАШno Madiga household should be there in the village;.тАЭ The committee has demanded security for Dalits besides installation of the Dr BR Ambedkar statue along with action against all the accused who allegedly participated in the attack. Following the incident, Siricilla Superintendent of Police (SP) Rahul Hegde visited the village. Police said that a case under various sections of IPC along with SC,ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA) has been registered and several accused have been arrested. However, activists alleged police inaction in dealing the case and registering the case.

NDA is all set to form the new government in Bihar with Nitish Kumar fourth term Chief Minister of the state. However, Sushil Kumar Modi seems not be so lucky to be the next deputy Chief Minister. If reports are to be believed, Kameshwar Chaupal is expected to be named as next Bihar Deputy Chief Minister by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on November 16. Kameshwar Chaupal is one of the 15 members of a trust set up on the directions of the Supreme Court to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya. Kameshwar Chaupal who is supposedly being made Deputy CM of Bihar is because he claims he comes from a Schedule Caste namely Chaupal as his surname suggests. However, his identity of being a member of Schedule Caste (Dalit) community is suspicious. According to an FIR registered at SC/ST Police Staion, Patna, vide registration number 28/99 he does not belong to a Dalit community and actually a member of Khatwey caste which falls under a backward caste. He was charged under sections 401, 465, 468, 470 and 471 of the IPC and section 3 (1) (ix) and 3 (2) (v) (vi) of the prevention of the Atrocity against the Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes Act, 1989. Former IPS Officer Amitabh Kumar Das, then CID SP of Araria, speaking to The Morning Chronicle confirmed that he himself had ordered to register an FIR against him in the above mentioned case. тАЬI was CID SP of Araria district. Chaupal was contesting an election from a SC reserved assembly seat of Raniganj. I had got a tip that his caste certificate was forged and he did not belong to Chaupal caste but a backward caste Khatwey. Soon after the tip, I investigated the case and found the accusation against him to be true. When I collected all the required evidence I ordered an FIR against him which was registered at Patna Harijan Police Station,тАЭ Mr, Das said. тАЬIn fact, the process of FIR registration between Police and CID is different. The Police initiate investigation after registration of FIR whereas the CID first conduct inquiry, collect evidences and when satisfied with all the evidences order to file an FIR,тАЭ when asked if he had solid proof against Mr. Chaupal, the former IPS said. Mr. Chaupal had then moved to Patna High Court with the help of current cabinet minister Ravi Shanker Prasad and made a plea to quash the FIR which the High Court rejected. The case is reportedly still pending in the lower court. Mr. Chaupal was accorded the honour of performing the first Shilanyas тАФ laying the first brick in the foundation for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on November 9, 1989 тАФ as part of the Sangh ParivarтАЩs social engineering. Kameshwar Chaupal had fought several elections but lost all. In 1991, he had fought from Rosera Lok Sabha seat against Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, who passed away ahead of 2020 Bihar polls and lost. In 1995, he fought Bihar Assembly Elections from Bakhari seat in Begusarai but again lost. In 2014 elections, the BJP had fielded him against Pappu YadavтАЩs wife Ranjeet Ranjan from Supaul seat. However, he could not win that time as well. He was a member of Bihar Legislative Council from the BJP in 2002.

Lakshmi said that as a native of Machilipatnam in Krishna district she came here to provide employment to the local people, but irreparable damage was done.  Recalling the series of incidents that led to the imbroglio to the media here on Monday, she said that she had taken 147 acres of prawn tanks on lease from Nukala Ramakrishna in Nandivada village near Gudivada in Krishna district for four years at the rate of Rs 90,000 per acre for cultivating prawns.  However, when her employees went to catch the yield of prawns in April last, the catch was already taken away from all the 147 acres by Nukala Ramakrishna and his son Balaji. She immediately rushed to the police and lodged a complaint, but the police did not take the complaint from her at that time.  Now, for the second time, the duo took away the catch of prawns from all the 147 acres. She again lodged a complaint with the police but there was no action against the culprits. They had stolen 150 tonnes of prawns from the tanks, she said. With the initiative of DGP Gautam Sawang, the police registered the criminal case in October against the accused but there was no follow up to recover the property.  Lakshmi Narasimhan appealed to Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to rescue her and do justice. ┬й 2021 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India. All rights reserved.

Lokesh termed it as highly condemnable that the SC, ST atrocities cases were filed against the Dalit farmers themselves in Krishnayapalem in Amaravati. On its part, the TDP would extend all kinds of support to the farmers from weaker sections who were waging a relentless struggle against the oppressive government, he said.  The Krishnayapalem farmers, who were jailed and later released on bail, met Lokesh at Undavalli and narrated their harrowing experiences. They thanked him for the TDP's support when the government meted out injustice to them. They said that they did not resort to any unlawful activity but just that they obstructed those coming from outside to enter the capital city area.  Speaking on the occasion, Lokesh said that the fact that this government had no humanity or decorum was exposed when the farmers were handcuffed and sent to jail. Though the complainant withdrew his police complaint, the government shifted the farmers to jail which was highly unpardonable. He alleged that from day one, the YSRCP was implementing anti-farmers policies as was evident from the inordinate delay in the Polavaram project works. Both Amaravati and Polavaram landmark projects were undermined in this rule.  He asserted that the day would come when the ruling party leaders would pay a heavy price for all the atrocities and injustices they were committing against the BC, SC, ST and Muslim minorities.  The Jagan regime had lost its moral right to govern the state going by how it was committing one mistake after another only to cover its continuing failures and incapacities. By running a repressive Police Raj, the ruling party would not be able to silence the voice of the people against its misdeeds, he said. ┬й 2021 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

"899",7744,"https://counterview.org/2020/11/02/how-dalits-from-villages-across-india-protested-the-hathras-crime-with-a-funeral-ritual/","How Dalits from villages across India protested the Hathras crime with a funeral ritual","COUNTERVIEW.ORG Voluntary blogging platform By Aathira Konikkara In October, Martin Macwan, a Dalit activist organised a tribute to the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gangraped and assaulted in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Macwan is one of the founders of a Gujarat-based non-profit, Dalit Foundation, which works for the empowerment of Dalit communities. In a programme named Bhim Kanya, people across villages in several states including Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana, predominantly from Dalit communities, applied turmeric on representational images of the 19-year-old woman. According to Macwan, over thirty thousand people, across a thousand villages, participated in the programme held on 14 October. On 1 October, a division bench of the Allahabad High Court took suo moto cognisance of the Hathras crime. The court said that the incidents following the Dalit womanтАЩs death on 29 September had shocked its conscience. Unfazed by the pleas of the victimтАЩs family or the presence of the media, local police officials had burned her body late at night and prevented her family from performing her last rites. The bench said that the Hathras victim was entitled to тАЬhonourable, decent and dignified last rites/cremation to be performed by her family members in keeping with the customs and traditions followed by the family.тАЭ Among other things, the court noted that the victimтАЩs mother wished to apply turmeric on her as part of the last rites but was not allowed to do so. Macwan said that society believed that тАЬDalits do not even have the last wish.тАЭ He described the significance of the turmeric ritual among Dalit communities and why it was central to the programme. тАЬThis is a cultural issue that whenever people die without marriage, they apply haldi because that was something to be applied at the time of wedding.тАЭ The banner designed for the event read, тАЬDalit bitiya ko izzat se jeene bhi nahi diya, izzat se marne bhi nahi diyaтАЭтАФThe Dalit daughter was neither allowed to live with dignity, nor die with dignity. The idea was for the participants at the programmes to apply turmeric to copies of this poster. In villages where the posters could not be accessed, they drew their own depiction of the Dalit woman. Macwan said that it was necessary to mobilise people in rural areas. The Dalit Foundation discovered that many did not know of what happened in Hathras until they were informed by the organisationтАЩs grassroots volunteers. тАЬTo the surprise of our colleagues, the amount of response that came from women was something they have not been able to understand,тАЭ Macwan added. Describing the turmeric ritual as a culturally powerful medium, he said, тАЬWhen women brought out the haldi from their own houses and when they were applying it, they went through that personal experience as if they are doing that to their own loved ones. And something they have suffered themselves as being women, as Dalit women.тАЭ While people from Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes participated in large numbers, Macwan said that the participation of women from the Valmiki community was particularly remarkable. The 19-year-old from Hathras was from a Valmiki community, which is a Dalit sub-caste. тАЬNormally they are never part of these programmes,тАЭ he said. тАЬWe saw that it was these women who were explaining to the other people that what wrong had happened. They understood it better than what I could describe. This was the reason why we did this programme, it had to be symbolic, yet very powerful and also give a political message.тАЭ The choice of date to hold the Bhim Kanya programme was also significantтАФit was on 14 October 1956 that BR Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in Nagpur along with lakhs of followers. I also spoke to Pradip More, the deputy director of the Dalit Foundation. He said that the turmeric ritual programme was not officially organised as a protest. тАЬWhy not have a different kind of protest where we will not say it is a protest but we will raise the issue of dignity of Dalit women,тАЭ More said. He added that the programmes held at the village level were called prerna sabhas, which literally translates to inspiration meeting. According to More, though these sabhas stuck to their purpose of paying last respects to the Hathras victim, and refrained from slogans and other marks of a protest, they still faced upper-caste opposition in many villages in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. However, the local Dalit communities were able to go ahead with the event. тАЬThe community is more organised now,тАЭ he said. тАЬThey are able to fight back.тАЭ He added that the Dalit FoundationтАЩs ground volunteers in the villages are doing follow-up meetings with participants of the programme to keep tabs on any threats they may face from upper-caste communities. Kuldeep Kumar Baudh, the convenor of Bundelkhand Dalit Adhikar Manch, a network of Dalit social activists and civil-society organisations, also noted that the Bhim Kanya program faced some backlash from upper caste groups in Uttar Pradesh. He told me that the upper-caste Thakur community felt threatened by the programme. тАЬOn 14 October, we could not organise it in all the villages where it was planned,тАЭ Baudh said. тАЬThe tyranny of Thakurs is rampant in Bundelkhand region. When they came to know that such a programme was being organised, they questioned it. This is an area prone to atrocities against Dalits.тАЭ For the last three years, BaudhтАЩs organisation, in association with the Dalit Foundation, has been working for the rehabilitation of Valmiki families forced to engage in manual scavenging. Many of the same families had mobilised to representationally offer haldi to the Hathras victim at prerna sabhas held in Jalaun district in Uttar Pradesh. But because of disruption by upper-caste villagers, the sabhas in around 20 villages were postponed to the following day. Altogether, the Bhim Kanya programme was organised in 65 villages in Jalaun. Referring to the upper-caste communities, Baudh added, тАЬThey fear that it will grow into a movement. They think that we are doing this today, tomorrow we will take to the streets.тАЭ Kalandi Mallick, a Dalit activist who mobilised prerna sabhas in eastern Odisha, echoed BaudhтАЩs sentiments. тАЬThe incident happened in UP and people here in remote villages in Odisha protested,тАЭ he said. тАЬDalit people, in UP or in Odisha, feel tied together by what the society inflicts on them and so they extend solidarity to each other.тАЭ He referred to a massacre in 2006 when 14 Adivasis who were protesting against land acquisition for a Tata steel plant in OdishaтАЩs Kalinganagar village were killed in police firing. тАЬAll the worldтАЩs Adivasis had converged here in solidarity,тАЭ Mallick said. тАЬSonia Gandhi had come to the village and held Adivasi children in her arms. People understood that if one Adivasi is harmed, all the worldтАЩs Adivasis will come together. Similarly, upper-caste people know that if one Dalit is harmed, all Dalits in Odisha, all Dalits in the world will gather. Dalits will get organised.тАЭ P Eshwaramma, an activist working with the Dalit Foundation in TelanganaтАЩs Narayanpet district, mobilised similar events in four villages in the state. тАЬWomen broke down on hearing the details of what happened to the girl in Hathras,тАЭ she said. тАЬThey said it does not matter where the crime has happened, we must feel shaken from within. We have to organise more such programmes,тАЭ she said. тАЬPeople are indifferent to the deaths of Dalit children.тАЭ Indu Rohit, the deputy director of Dalit Shakti Kendra, a vocational training centre affiliated to the Dalit Foundation, said that the Hathras case was not an anomaly and that Dalit women faced a disproportionate extent of sexual violence. Rohit said that young girls under the care of DSK have often voiced fear of violence from upper-caste men in their neighbourhoods, perceiving themselves to be under threat even on their way to relieve themselves. She emphasised that sexual violence against Dalit women occurs in the larger context of routine exertion of power by upper caste communities. Rohit narrated an anecdote told to her by a girl from Madhya Pradesh, about the access to water from a handpump in a village in the state. тАЬThe handpumps there were installed by the government,тАЭ Rohit said. тАЬBut the dominant castes show their power here as well and get to use the handpumps first, ordering everyone else to stand aside. Dalit women are the last ones who can access water.тАЭ The girl refuted the casteist practice and stood ahead in line to use the handpump. тАЬA Brahmin woman asked her to move aside and started fighting,тАЭ Rohit continued. тАЬWhen the girl continued to resist, she became quiet. After the girl filled water and left, that woman spent an hour to clean the handpump.тАЭ Rohit described the reaction of Dalit women in rural Gujarat to the Hathras case. тАЬThe sensitive aspect that angered women the most, when they were told about it in the villages, was that even after she suffered such brutalisation, her mother was not allowed to perform the final rites,тАЭ Rohit said. тАЬShe only asked for a chance to apply a coat of haldi.тАЭ The commonality of the ritual for Dalit communities deeply resonated with women across states. Volunteers of the Dalit Foundation plan to collect the turmeric from the prerna sabhas that were held across the country, and are in the process of deciding their next course of action. One possibility is that the turmeric will be used to build a sculpture of the Buddha showcasing the abhaya mudra, a hand gesture representing fearlessness. Referring to Dalit communities, Macwan said, тАЬWhat bothers me the most as an activist in the last 40 years is that the state continuously conveys a sense of fear to the population,тАЭ Macwan said, referring to the Dalit populace. тАЬFreedom is associated with the absence of fear. That is the message we want to communicate; that we are not afraid.тАЭ тАФ Courtesy: Caravan Magazine Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

"901",7759,"https://thekashmirhorizon.com/2020/11/05/dalit-lives-matter/","Dalit lives matter","India the country that was under British colonial rule for years finally got freedom on 15th of August 1947 after enormous sacrifices. Father of the Nation Mohan Das Karamchad Ghandi first fought Apartheid in South Africa and then turned itтАЩs attention to India. The British Colonial rule started from establishment of East India Company which was founded on 31st December 1600 by John Watts & George White. The company kept expanding itself from time to time till the Governor Generals fully colonialised the country. The country gave immense sacrifices cutting across the religious lines. Khan Abdul Gafar khan a Muslim known as Frontier Ghandi played an instrumental role in the freedom struggle of the country and legendary poetic Sir Mohammed Iqbal too contributed significantly in the freedom struggle. It needs no explanations. Baghat Singh, Rajdeep & Sukhguru were hanged for the Freedom of India. Dr. Baba Rov Ambadkar a dalit also known as Father of India Constitution worked very closely with Mahatma Ghandi for the freedom of India. By naming some Muslims, some Hindus and a dalit the message I want to send across is that India was freed from the clutches of the colonial rule with the collective efforts of People of India including people of all the religions and races. On 26th of January 1947 India became тАЬRepublicтАЭ By implementing itтАЩs own Constitution and the Preamble of the Constitution makes it is clear that India is a тАЭ Secular тАЭ Country that puts no restrictions of any sort unless on any individual or group for carrying out religious or social activities. India is home to people of different faiths and castes, тАЬDalitsтАЭ are one among them. Dalits fall under schedule caste category.Till the implementation of Constitution they were referred as тАЭ Untouchables тАЭ . But with the implementation of Constitution it was declared illegal. However still the condition of the Dalits is in no way better. Before introducing the word тАЬDalitsтАЭ they were called Harijans. Mahatma Ghandi called untouchable Harijinas тАЬChildren of The God Vishnu or simply тАЭ Children of God тАЭ .But even after Gandhi called them so these Dalits are believed and still do the job that a high class or a person with higher cast will never do. Still in India the same Dalit community that gave them Constitution is being treated as if they donтАЩt fall in the human category. They arenтАЩt allowed to take water from the well thatтАЩs being used by the people of other high castes, they arenтАЩt allowed to enter the temples, they arenтАЩt allowed to touch the belongings of higher class people and above all they still have to sit on floor when everyone else is sitting on chair. Be it shopping malls, temples, schools, meetings or any other place of public attraction Dalits are facing discrimination. They donтАЩt have any ray of hope of getting better. And in the present times the crimes against them are continuing unabated. In a recent incident a meeting of urban body where all the Elected Panchs and sarpanche were present and were sitting, a dalit elected representative was made to sit on floor. Not only this day in and day out the videos of dalits being tied and beaten have become a new norm. In one heart wrenching incidents a dalit who had taken water from the well of upper cast people was made to drink the urine of upper caste population after being tied. In 21st century where caste doesnтАЩt matter this is the condition of Indian Dalits. Inter caste marriage is a far away a thing. And unfortunately the government that claims of having law and order under control is silent on all the incidents and they a have not a word to speak about it. A dalit MLA from BJP visited a temple and after she left the temple it was cleaned. What more to prove the condition of Dalits in India. In odisha 40 families were barred from entering village and the reason was that a Dalit girl had plucked a flower. In Tamil Nadu Dalits are forced to drop their dead bodies from bridge so that the upper caste isnтАЩt annoyed. The Dalits face crimes just because they ride their bike in front of an upper caste. Such is worst situation of Dalits in India. What sort of crimes Dalits face against themselves on daily basis shivers me up. Their lives have become hell and they have no way out. According to news published by NDTV on October 13 one 65 years old Dalit man was forced to drink urine in UP. Even an old aged Dalit man isnтАЩt safe. A news Published by Deccan Herad on October 15 saysтАЭ Another Dalit Girl was raped in UPтАЭ . The word another must signify the continuing process of Dalit women being raped. According to National crime records bureau тАШEvery day 6 Dalit women are being rapedтАЭ. And the same bureau says тАЭ Every 15 mins a crime is committed against Dalits тАЬ. The record of the bureau is enough to make one image how worst is the situation of Dalits. Beating them, making them drink urine and humiliating them and then making the video viral has become a new norm. According to a verified Twitter handle @DalitRights тАЬAlmost 3 out of 10 Dalits are still prevented from entering police stationsтАЭ Look this is the situation with police stations. When they arenтАЩt allowed to enter police stations how will they have their rights assured and how they will report crimes against themselves when they arenтАЩt allowed inside Police stations. Not even thinking about FIR being registered. According to the same handle тАЭ At least 1 in every 10 villages are denied access to polling booths or forced to form a separate lineтАЭ Well at the time when what they have been calling it тАЭ Festival of Democracy тАЭ Dalits have to face discrimination . When will this demarcation go? When will the Dalits be treated as humans, leave alone being treated equals? The handle says тАЬEvery 1 out of 3 public health workers refuse to visit homeтАЭ They even have been sidelined in the health sector. Be it shopping malls, temples, schools, meetings or any other place of public attraction Dalits are facing discrimination. They donтАЩt have any ray of hope of getting better.

The incident took place on the night of Diwali in the Kotwali area of Jaipur`s Walled City. The 37-year-old woman had filed a complaint of rape against the accused. The man had been absconding since then. A dalit woman in Jaipur was allegedly set on fire by a man accused of raping her. The incident took place on the night of Diwali in the Kotwali area of Jaipur`s Walled City. The 37-year-old woman had filed a complaint of rape against the accused in April this year and the accused had been absconding since then. Police have arrested the rape accused, Lekhraj Koli (28), his brothers Ramesh Chand (40), Manmohan Koli (35), and their father Kanhaiyalal (70). Kotwali police station SHO Yeshwant Singh said the four were arrested on Sunday and produced before a magistrate. The accused were sent to police remand till November 18. Singh said the accused have been arrested under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code for an attempt to murder, and that the brothers and father of the accused have been arrested for assisting him in the crime. He said that as per the victim`s statement, she and her daughter were at home while her husband had gone to a nearby temple on Diwali night. The accused entered her home, doused her with petrol and set her on fire, and fled. As the woman tried to put out the fire, her 12-year-old daughter tried to help her mother and also sustained burn injuries on her legs. Hearing her screams, the woman`s husband and neighbours rushed to her rescue and put out the flames. The woman and her daughter had been rushed to SMS hospital. The woman has sustained over 50 percent burns and her condition is serious. The daughter sustained 10 percent burns and will be discharged in a couple of days, doctors said. Singh said the victim had filed a complaint of rape against Lekhraj in April this year. Lekhraj had been absconding since then. She had said in her complaint that Lekhraj, who is her husband`s relative and lives nearby, used to visit their house often and brought gifts for them. She said that he had raped her around 1.5 years back when she was alone at home. Since then relations between the two families had soured. Singh said that police are probing all angles and questioning the accused and the woman`s husband to find out if there was enmity between the two families.

Email Address: Follow Human Wrongs Watch HYDERABAD, India , Nov 2 2020 (IPS)* тАУ Shabnam*, a young woman from Northern IndiaтАЩs Haryana state, is two years away from becoming a law graduate. She sees parallels between her own rape and that of the 19-year-old Maha Dalit woman whose brutal rape and torture by a group of men from a тАЬdominantтАЭ or тАЬhigherтАЭ caste in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh triggered nationwide protests.  Women listen to the news in a village comprising mainly of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh. After a 19-year-old young woman was murdered and raped in the state last month it triggered nationwide protests. Credit: Stella Paul/IPS тАЬShe was a Valmiki like us, from a landless and poor family like ours. They raped her, brutalised her and when she died, they burnt her body without the consent of her family. And even after all of that, they would not allow her family to talk about it and threaten them to keep quiet. This is exactly what I and my family have experienced and what we continue to go through. The only exception is that I am still alive,тАЭ Shabnam tells IPS in Hindi. The 19-year-old young woman eventually died of her injuries. But just like her, Shabnam also belongs to the Maha Dalit тАУ IndiaтАЩs most marginalised and oppressed community formerly known as тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ. The death of the young woman focused a spotlight on the sexual violence faced by Dalit women in India, who number some 100 million according to a discussion document by Navsarjan Trust (India), FEDO (Nepal) and the International Dalit Solidarity Network. тАЬViolence, including rape and gang rape, have been systematically utilised as weapons by dominant castes to oppress Dalit women and girls and reinforce structural gender and caste hierarchies,тАЭ a soon-to-be-released report by Equality Now, a global non-profit which promotes human rights and equality, and the local charity Swabhiman Society, states. тАЬIn the northern state of Haryana, where Dalit make up around one-fifth of the stateтАЩs population, a deeply-rooted caste-based and patriarchal society still flourishes. There are high rates of violence against women тАУ data from the National Crime Records Bureau in 2018 indicates that nearly 4 women are raped every day in this state alone,тАЭ the report further states. Titled тАЬJustice Denied: Sexual Violence and intersectional discrimination: Barriers to Accessing Justice for Dalit Women and Girls in Haryana, IndiaтАЭ, the report draws from Swabhiman SocietyтАЩs experience of working directly with Dalit survivors of sexual violence in Haryana over the past decade and highlights insights from this work. Shabnam was a minor when she was gang raped in 2013. Over the past seven years, even as her case has gone to trial, there have been several attempts and threats on her life for which she was eventually granted court protection. тАЬPeople think rape is a single crime. But for Dalit rape victims, itтАЩs just the beginning of a lifelong chain of crimes and struggles: mental abuse, fear, intimidation, threats, denial of basic rights, denial of education and a decent livelihood тАУ the list is very long. In fact, once you are raped, you stay a victim all through your life,тАЭ Manisha Mashaal, founder of Swabhiman Society, tells IPS in Hindi. Mashaal, a Dalit womenтАЩs rights defender and lawyer, is helping Shabnam and many other young women in their fight for justice. According to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), a federal agency, cases of physical attacks on women have been increasing. In 2019 alone, says NCRBs latest report, there were over 405,861 cases of assaults on women тАФ 7 percent more than was reported in 2018. The crimes include beating, stripping, kidnapping and rape. Of these, 13,273 assaults, which included 3,486 cases of rape, were against women from Dalit communities. Jacqui Hunt, the Europe and Eurasia Director of Equality Now, says widespread under-reporting and problems registering sexual assaults with the police mean that the true figures are likely to be considerably higher. тАЬAs a consequence of gender, caste and class inequalities, Dalit women and girls are subjected to multiple forms of subjugation, exploitation, and oppression. Sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, has been perpetrated against them by men from dominant castes as a mechanism that reinforces IndiaтАЩs deeply entrenched structural hierarchies. WomenтАЩs bodies are being used as a battleground to assert caste supremacy and to keep women тАШin their place,тАЩтАЭ Hunt tells IPS. Mashaal believes that almost 80 percent of Dalit women who are raped do not report the crime because of political and social pressure as the women and their families are usually threatened by the perpetrators. Besides, Mashaal says, a majority of the sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) survivors are minor Dalit girls, while NCRB data for child rape survivors does not differentiate according to caste. To help break the cycle of silence on crimes against Dalit women and girls, in 2013 Mashaal founded Swabhiman Society тАУ a charity that provides various services, including legal and psychological support to Dalit survivors of SGBV. тАЬWe currently have 25 women who work with us off and on, but this is a safe place for hundreds of women who have been stigmatised, brutalised and yet have nobody else to turn to,тАЭ says Mashaal. Mashaal started the society because she noticed few organisations were aiding Dalit survivors of SBGV and that there was a lack of knowledge and awareness among the community about their legal rights to justice or the procedure to follow. In several cases, they would be dictated to settle out of the court by the Khap Panchayat тАУ a powerful, traditional, community assembly run by the landowning Jat community, which decides on village affairs. The decisions of the Khap are often controversial and considered anti-Dalit, but few dare oppose them fearing reprisals. Mamta*, another woman Mashaal represents, was a minor when she was gang raped by тАЬdominantтАЭ caste men in 2012. When the Khap Panchayat ordered that she had to marry one of her rapists, her father тАУ a farmhand and daily wage earner тАФ was too scared to oppose the decision. For months Mamta was locked in a small room and repeatedly raped by both her тАШhusbandтАЩ and his friends and relatives. тАЬIt was like a cage. I lived in a small room. My husband would lock the door from outside. He would not otherwise touch me as I was a Dalit but would forcibly have sex whenever he wanted. Every day, he would bring other men and they would also rape me. тАЬI was like a fly stuck in mud тАУ I could not live and could not fly away either,тАЭ Mamta, who is now 26, tells IPS in Hindi. Eventually Mamta managed to escape and discovered the Swabhiman Society. There she met many other women who had also experienced similar abuse and brutality. Together they have received counselling, awareness training about laws on rape and sexual attacks on women. But most important of all, they have gathered the courage to demand justice in a legal court. According to Hunt, Dalit women lack economic power and are often reliant on dominant castes for their livelihoods. When survivors of sexual assault or their families are dependent for jobs or other sources of income from someone who is from the same caste as an assailant, or the perpetrator is also their employer, accessing justice for sexual violence becomes even more problematic тАЬCulprits and their associates often wield their economic power to silence survivors and witnesses. This includes coercing survivors or victimsтАЩ family members into settling cases out of court, or hounding them from their home and village. тАЬOur forthcoming report gives an indication of how common this problem is. In almost 60 percent of the cases we studied, survivors were forced into a compromise, many times caused by threats of economic retaliation,тАЭ Hunt says. According to the recent data published by the Census of India, 71 percent Dalits are landless labourers who work on land they do not own. According to the Agriculture Census, in rural areas, 58.4 percent Dalit households do not own land at all. This gets grimmer in Dalit-dominated states such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where 85 percent do not own land. тАЬThis is the reason why there is continuous gruesome sexual assaults on Dalit women because they are thrice-vulnerable. First, because of their caste, second, because of their gender and third, because of their landless status,тАЭ says Mashaal. Independent studies have established this as well. According to a 2018 study by Reena Kukreja, an assistant Professor at Queens University, Canada, the Dalit community in Haryana, тАЬwith over 80 percent of Dalits living in rural areas, they are dependent on the three landowning castes for agricultural wage labour as their primary source of livelihood.тАЭ The study explores the link between land rights and gender violence, especially in the context of Dalit womenтАЩs marriages in Haryana. The women Mashaal represents donтАЩt believe there is a silver bullet for the endemic SGBV against women in their community. It is why a number of them are pursuing a college degree, especially in law. тАЬEvery time we go to court, we see the perpetrators hiring 10 to 15 lawyers to fight their cases. They hire big law firms. On the other hand, a Dalit woman victim can hardly afford a single lawyer. It is very frustrating. So, we encourage the girls who come here to go back to school and study law. We must build our own network of women lawyers who will fight and win every single case of Dalit rape,тАЭ Mashaal says. Presently, at least 10 women from the Swabhiman Society are studying law, says Shabnam. Pooja* is another young Dalit woman whom Mashaal is assisting. When Pooja was only 17 she was kidnapped by 12 men who took turns to rape her. Pooja тАУ the youngest of the women тАФ just passed her last school exams and plans to enrol in a law school. Though her enrolment has been delayed by COVID-19 lockdowns. тАЬI will apply to a private college if needed and take up a job to pay the fees, but will not give up on becoming a lawyer,тАЭ Pooja tells IPS as Mashaal and the other Dalit women in the room break into a cheering chorus of support pledging to тАЬmake sure that happensтАЭ. Meanwhile, the Equality Now / Swabhiman Society joint report provides recommendations for improvement of the police, medico-legal and judicial processes in Haryana to improve access to justice for survivors of sexual violence, particularly Dalit women and girls. *Not her real name.

The statement can be viewed on YouTube and as a text transcription below:   Transcription of Professor Angela Davis statement (uploaded on 27th October 2020) Greetings. It is a major honor to be able to participate in this press conference highlighting the need for solidarity between Dalit people in India and black people in the U.S., in conjunction with the campaign protesting the sexual assault and murder of a young Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh and, of course, the many victims of violence enabled and condoned by the State. As Dalit activists and intellectuals have pointed out, the history of making connections between our two communities stretches back to the 19th century when most U.S. black people were enslaved. We deeply appreciate the solidarity that has been generated on so many occasions by Dalit activists. However, we must also be critical, self-critical, of our own failure to produce meaningful and transformative solidarity with Dalit people. Most recently, Dalit feminists have on several occasions made passionate calls for solidarity, especially with their efforts to resist the interminable assaults, particularly assaults involving sexual violence, against Dalit women. And so, we salute those who are standing up to resist casteism and patriarchy, capitalism. As we here in the United States attempt to move forward in our struggles against structural racism, and state and vigilante violence, we thank you for your solidarity and recognize that it is our responsibility to join you. We need to express our rage against racial, sexual and caste-based violence in India, and we need to demand justice for the victims, the survivors, and their families. This is a time when the world is beginning to rise together to demand justice for those who are targeted by white supremacists and casteists. Therefore, we stand with those who are issuing a global cry for an end to racism and who not only say black lives matter but also Dalit lives matter and Muslim lives matter. We protest the consolidation of casteist and fundamentalist religious forces against Dalits in the service of a fascist state, where a violent form of hindutva is deployed in order to bolster capitalism. We express our deepest condolences to the family and community of the young victim of rape and murder in Uttar Pradesh. We further join those who are demanding an end to all forms of caste based and state violence in India. Thank you.

Life has been one long struggle for Chithralekha. Ostracised and shunned over the years because of her layered identity as a Dalit woman auto rickshaw driver, the hardest battle she has had to fight, however, might have been against the CPM which, she says, has been continually harassing her in the name of caste.  Tired of waging the lone battle against the Goliath party and its alleged casteism, the Payyannur native has now made the decision to try and escape from the shackles of caste by converting to Islam. тАЬI am doing this because I am unable to continue this fight alone anymore,тАЭ she wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.  тАЬJust because I was born a Pulaya woman and I dared to question the caste discrimination practised by the CPM, I was tortured to the extent that I had to run away from my own village,тАЭ Chithralekha said in her Facebook post. Even though she had fled from Payyannur and settled down in a house in Kattampally, the harassment did not end.  CPM workers allegedly went on to set ablaze her auto rickshaw at Edatt in December 2005, just a year after she bought it. Chithralekha said she was not even given the consideration that she was a woman and belonged to a Dalit community.  тАЬThough the UDF government led by then chief minister Oommen Chandy had given me five cents of land and Rs 5 lakh to build a house, the LDF government revoked this order after it came to power in 2016.

Stating that she had to learn more about the religion before converting, she said she hadnтАЩt decided when to embrace Islam yet.  тАЬSome people have offered to help me with these learnings. But I do not wish to reveal their names here. Once I make a final decision, I will announce it publicly,тАЭ she said.

Around 5,000 Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protesters, led by its founder, firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, began rallying on Sunday on a main highway between Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi, vowing to march on the French embassy.  The protesters were chanting anti-France slogans, demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador.  According to the group, it signed a deal with the government early on Tuesday to end the protest, after assurance from authorities to consider expelling the French ambassador to Pakistan and to boycott French goods.  The agreement signed between the two sides has four points: One, the government will put the question of expelling the French ambassador to the parliament тАЬwithin two or three monthsтАЭ.  Two, the government тАЬwill not appoint its ambassador to FranceтАЭ.  Three, that Pakistan will тАЬcompletely boycott French goods on a government levelтАЭ. Finally, amnesty to the dozens of TLP protesters who were arrested during the course of the protest.  The agreement was signed by interior minister and federal minister for religious affairs, in the early hours of Tuesday.  The TLP has held several protests in Islamabad on blasphemy-related issues in recent years. Considered a sensitive subject in Pakistan, conviction for blasphemy against Islam carries a mandatory death sentence. Accusations of blasphemy have increasingly led to mob violence or targeted attacks in Pakistan in recent years.  https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/islamists-call-off-their-anti-france-protest-after-deal-with-government/articleshow/79270132.cms  --------  Bangladesh Islamic Extremists Threaten Shakib Al-Hasan Over His Participation In A Hindu Ceremony In Kolkata  by Sumon Corraya  11/17/2020   Shakib Al Hasan. Photograph:( AFP )  ------  Dhaka (AsiaNews) тАУ Controversy continues to rage around cricket player Shakib al-Hasan, a Bangladeshi Muslim, over his participation in a Hindu ceremony in Kolkata (India) last Thursday.  The storm stems from the popular championтАЩs alleged participation in the inauguration of a pooja mandap, a wooden temple, with offerings and prayers.  The morning after the event, a Muslim extremist named Mohsin Talukdar, from Sylhet, repeatedly insulted and threatened Shakib in a video uploaded to Facebook saying that he would cut his throat and dismember his body (picture 2) for insulting Islam and Muslims.  Cricket is widely popular in Bangladesh and South Asia. And public opinion split between defenders and opponents of the cricket player. In a couple of days, his official Facebook fan page lost nearly a million followers after mainstream media released images of the ""inauguration"" of the pooja mandap.  In an attempt to appease feelings, Shakib's radical enemy Moshin said he was sorry for his ""offensive"" remarks but urged the cricket champion to apologise for having ""offended Muslims"".  The second video, however, did not stop police from arresting him this morning at his home for making death threats in the first video.  For his part, Shakib said that he did not take part in the inauguration of a pooja mandan but still asked for тАЬforgiveness"" for what happened.  тАЬIt is not possible to understand the context and the story by looking only at a picture. However, if anyone felt offended that I went there, I ask your forgiveness,тАЭ he said.  Shakib explained that he had played for the Kolkata Knight Riders team and is well known in the West Bengal city. During his visit, he was invited to an event at a time when Indians celebrate the Deepavali (Diwali) festival.  When asked, he lit a candle for Deepavali as a token of friendship. For some this is a poor excuse; for others, his apology is a just caving in to extremists who continue to use Islam to threaten and attack.  тАЬShakib is a grown man,тАЭ said Nirmol Palma, not the personтАЩs real name, speaking to AsiaNews. тАЬHe took part in a Hindu activity and Islamic extremists reacted to it negatively.тАЭ  To avoid a violent reaction, he тАЬsaid he was a practising Muslim,тАЭ and apologised for тАЬdoing something wrong.тАЭ  http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Islamic-extremists-threaten-cricket-star-Shakib-over-a-Hindu-symbol-51614.html  --------  US Military Gathering Location Data Of Muslims Around The World, Harvested From Innocuous-Seeming Apps  17 November 2020  The US military is purchasing private data from app companies that provide popular services for Muslims.  The US military is тАЬbuying the granular movement data of people around the world, harvested from innocuous-seeming apps,тАЭ Joseph Cox of VICEтАЩs Motherboard wrote on Monday.  The report revealed that the US military purchased users' data from popular apps such as Muslim prayer and Quran app which has been downloaded nearly 100 billion times.  Motherboard did not specify why the data of Muslim civilians was being collected from seemingly harmless apps; however, the US military has infamously used movement and location data of users for aiming in and striking targets with assassination drones, targeting numerous civilians, including women and children, in Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen.  Alarmingly, one of the buyers of the apps' data was the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), which deals with counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism and various covert activity around the globe, media reported.  US Navy Commander Tim Hawkins confirmed the report, noting that Americans' private data was safe and the information gathered by the US military was used for overseas operations.  тАЬOur access to the software is used to support Special Operations Forces mission requirements overseas. We strictly adhere to established procedures and policies for protecting the privacy, civil liberties, constitutional and legal rights of American citizens,тАЭ he said.  Muslim US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar acknowledged the close ties between the military and tech companies.  ""The military industrial complex and the surveillance state have always had a cozy relationship with tech. Buying bulk data in order to profile Muslims is par for the course for them,"" Omar noted.  In 2013, US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistle-blower Edward Snowden disclosed the extent of US spying activities.  Snowden revealed details of US intelligence agenciesтАЩ secret surveillance programs.  US authorities want Snowden to stand trial in a criminal court for disclosing US spying activities.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/17/638803/US-Military-Muslim-App-Pakistan  --------  UK de-radicalization referrals for far-right, Islamist extremists now equal  November 17, 2020  LONDON: For the first time since data has been recorded, there was an equal number of referrals to the UKтАЩs de-radicalization programs for far-right and Islamist extremists.  In the year leading up to March 2019, out of 5,738 referrals to the governmentтАЩs counter-terrorism program Channel, 1,404 (24 percent) were for concerns related to Islamist radicalization and 1,389 (24 percent) related to right-wing radicalization.  Of those right-wingers, 62 percent were youths up to the age of 20, and in the 2017-2018 period, 682 children under the age of 18 were referred for links to the radical right. Children as young as 9 have been referred to Channel for right-wing radicalization.  One counter-extremism group, Exit UK, said 70 percent of the people it has helped leave far-right organizations were recruited online.  Islamophobic propaganda and messaging by far-right groups are often a major force behind their recruitment.  One former member of a far-right group told Sky News: тАЬThe enemy in our minds was Islam, (it) was the Muslim people, (it) was almost the police as well as the government, and journalists as well.тАЭ  The UKтАЩs MI5 and various counter-extremism organizations have repeatedly cautioned of the growing threat of far-right violence in the UK and across Europe.  In 2019, Britain saw four far-right attacks or plots, one more than the number of Islamist incidents in the same period.  https://www.arabnews.com/node/1764561/world  --------  YemenтАЩs Ansarullah urges halt to arms sales to тАШchild-killerтАЩ Saudi Arabia  17 November 2020  YemenтАЩs Houthi Ansarullah movement has praised countries that have adopted measures to halt arms sales to the тАЬchild-killerтАЭ regime in Saudi Arabia, calling on other world states to follow suit.  тАЬWe express our appreciation to the countries that have taken steps to stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, which is a child-killer regime,тАЭ the Ansarullah spokesman, Mohammed Abdul-Salam, said in a statement on Monday evening, referring to the Riyadh regimeтАЩs crimes against Yemeni children.  He called on other world states to adopt similar steps, emphasizing that freezing such exports to the kingdom is the least humanitarian position that could be taken in the face of the brutal Saudi-led aggression against Yemen, which poses threats to global security and stability.  The comments come as Germany is set to discuss extending its ban on arms exports to the countries involved in the war on Yemen in the coming weeks ahead of its expiry on December 31.  Despite opposition from France and Britain, two major arms suppliers to Saudi Arabia, Chancellor Angela MerkelтАЩs coalition enacted the ban in late 2018, in response to the devastating consequences of the Saudi-led war in Yemen and following the state-sponsored murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Along with Germany, a number of other European countries, including Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, have also suspended arms sales to Riyadh.  France urged to give MPs control over arms sales  Meanwhile, 14 of the worldтАЩs top human rights organizations on Monday called on the Paris government to тАЬend FranceтАЩs opacity on arms sales,тАЭ ahead of the publication of a parliamentary fact-finding report on arms export control to be published on November 18.  A joint press release, co-signed by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Federation for Human Rights FIDH, Oxfam, and a number of local organizations said parliamentary control was тАЬessential since French arms sales have been shown to be responsible for certain serious violations of humanitarian law, particularly in Yemen, where those violations have dramatic consequences for the civilian population.тАЭ  Heavily relying on Western-supplied arms, the Saudi regime has been leading a military coalition of allied countries in a bloody war against Yemen since 2015 with the aim of reinstalling a Riyadh-friendly government in SanaтАЩa.  The military campaign has largely targeted ordinary people and YemenтАЩs civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, drawing calls from leading human rights groups for a halt to weapons sales to the aggressors.  The US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit conflict-research organization, estimates that the war has claimed more than 100,000 lives for over the past five years.  The Ansarullah movement, backed by armed forces, has been defending Yemen against the Saudi-led alliance, preventing the aggressors from fulfilling the objectives of the atrocious war.

For all the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.  тАЬAccordingly, the relationship with #Israel will return to how it was,тАЭ he added.  In February, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that his country would cut all ties with the United States and Israel, including those relating to security, after rejecting a Middle East peace plan presented by US President Donald Trump.  Israel and the Palestinian AuthorityтАЩs security forces have long cooperated in policing areas of the occupied West Bank that are under Palestinian control. The PA also has intelligence cooperation agreements with the CIA, which continued even after the Palestinians began boycotting the Trump administrationтАЩs peace efforts in 2017.  In a Zoom video conference organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said the decision to resume contacts with Israel was based in part on confronting the health crisis.  Between the hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers who live in the West Bank, and the tens of thousands of Palestinian workers who commute to Israel daily for work, coordination was needed to help prevent the virusтАЩs spread, Shtayyeh said.  тАЬOur life is so interconnected between us and the Israelis, and there is no way that we can fight viruses by ourselves only,тАЭ he said.  Palestinian sources said cooperation with Israel would resume immediately. An Israeli official said тАЬwe are very closeтАЭ to renewing coordination, citing exchanges of messages between IsraelтАЩs defense minister and Palestinian authorities.  тАЬOne thing that certainly helped the Palestinians (reach their decision) was (Joe) BidenтАЩs election (as U.S. president), which gave them ... an excuse to climb down from the tree,тАЭ said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/11/17/Palestine-to-resume-relationship-with-Israel-after-monthslong-pause-Official  --------   India   Muslim Family Hands Over Temple Land Ownership Papers On Which A Shiva Temple Is Built To Temple Committee, In Meerut  Nov 17, 2020  A Muslim family of the city set an example of communal harmony on Diwali day when they handed over ownership papers of a piece of land, on which a Shiva temple is built, to the templeтАЩs management committee.  According to the family members, in 1976 their grandfather had verbally donated the land in the cityтАЩs Indira Nagar locality for the temple.  The temple was constructed on this donated land almost 25 years ago but land was still in the name of late Kasim Ali of Shakoor Nagar here.  Meanwhile, a group of local residents tried to take control of the temple as there was no management committee to take care of it. Another group of local residents, led by Sumit Kumar Sharma, opposed them and formed a committee of 11 members for management of the temple. тАЬWe submitted all required documents in the registrarтАЩs office almost a month ago for registration of the committee,тАЭ said Sharma, president of the committee.  They then came to know that Kasim Ali had verbally donated the land for the temple and the committee members approached AliтАЩs family last week with a request to hand over the papers of the land. Kasim AliтАЩs sons Hazi Asim, Sajid and Sabir assured them of handing over the documents of the land soon.  Kashif Ali, son of Sajid and a TV artiste in Mumbai, said his family got the papers of the land prepared and handed them over to the committee on Diwali day.  Showing their gratitude towards the Ali family, members and officials of the temple committee and local residents felicitated the three brothers and Kashif Ali inside on temple premises on Monday and expressed their gratitude to them for honoring the will of their grandfather. тАЬThey set an example of communal harmony by their gesture,тАЭ said Sharma  Kashif said: тАЬWe believe that people should respect each otherтАЩs religion and spread the message of harmony and brotherhood.тАЭ  https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-meerut-muslim-family-hands-over-temple-land-ownership-papers-to-mgmt-committee/story-lep3mq9kr48PCQfZixPJKJ.html  --------  Congress, CPI(M) plan to woo Muslims in Bengal ahead of AIMIM march for 2021 elections  November 18, 2020  In a bid to stall the march of AIMIM in West Bengal, opposition CPI(M) and Congress on Tuesday chalked out a detailed plan to reach out to the politically crucial minority community of the state ahead of the 2021 assembly polls.  Political equations in the polarised state are set to witness significant changes as the sway of non-BJP parties over minorities, a key factor in several seats, appears to be set for a stiff challenge with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM announcing that it will contest Bengal assembly polls, sources in the two parties said.  AIMIM has clinched five seats in Bihar in the state polls.  The CPI(M) and the Congress, which has decided to fight the next assembly polls as alliance partners, Tuesday night held a two-hour-long meeting to determine the strategy for the next assembly polls.  ""As a part of our outreach programme, apart from reaching out to the community leaders and eminent personalities from the minorities community, both the parties have decided to conduct special outreach programme on the National Minorities Day on December 18. We have chalked out a detailed plan,"" said a senior state Congress leader who is privy to the development said.  Before the meeting, West Bengal PCC president Adhir Chowdhury and state Leader of the opposition Abdul Mannan met Muslim religious leader Toha Siddique and appealed to the community o stand by the secular forces, he said.  ""We met Toha Siddique at Furfura Sharif and appealed to minority community not to get confused by the forces who are B-team of the BJP,"" Chowdhury later told reporters.  When asked about Owaisi's plan to venture into West Bengal, Chowdhury iterated ""AIMIM is nothing but the B-team of the BJP, whose sole aim is to divide the Muslim votes and cause damage to the secular parties"".  According to state Congress and CPI(M) sources, both the parties are concerned about AIMIM's entry into Bengal as 34 out of the 76 seats it had won in the 2016 assembly polls as an alliance were from minority-dominated districts of Malda, Murshidabad and North Dinajpur. These are districts which AIMIM is eyeing.  A deciding factor in nearly 100-110 seats in the state, minorities specially the 30 per cent Muslims, till 2019 had acted as a bulwark of the TMC against its rivals, with most of them voting in favour of the party. The minorities had considered TMC to be a ""credible"" force that can resist saffron surge.  But AIMIM's decision to fight the assembly polls is likely to affect it.  During the meeting, it was also decided that the Congress and the CPI-M will set up a joint core committee to look into the aspects of district-wise seat-sharing in the assembly polls.  It has also been decided to increase the number of joint rallies and programmes in the state, the senior Congress leader said.  https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/congress-cpm-woo-muslims-in-bengal-1741794-2020-11-18  --------  тАШWas BJP-PDP alliance to bring back terror in J&K?тАЩ asks Kapil Sibal after ShahтАЩs тАШGupkar gangтАЩ remark  Posted by Shivani Kumar  Nov 18, 2020  Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday lashed out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his тАЬGupkar gangтАЭ remark and asked him if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-PeopleтАЩs Democratic Alliance (PDP) alliance was done to тАЬbring back terrorтАЭ in Jammu and Kashmir.  тАЬAmit Shah alleges: Congress wants to take тАШJ&K back to the era of terror and turmoilтАЩ when in talk with other parties in the upcoming District Development Council elections. Amitji was BJP -PDP alliance to тАЬbring back terror in J&K ..тАЭ ? Which gang were you then part of?тАЭ Sibal tweeted.  On Tuesday, Shah had said that the PeopleтАЩs Alliance for Gupkar Declaration wants foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir and asserted that Indian people will no longer tolerate an тАЬunholy global gathbandhanтАЭ against national interest.  Taking to Twitter, Shah had asked Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi if they support the PeopleтАЩs Alliance for Gupkar Declaration which, he said, insults IndiaтАЩs tricolour.  The Home Minister said that тАЬCongress and the Gupkar Gang want to take Jammu and Kashmir back to the era of terror and turmoilтАЭ.  However, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala clarified that тАЬCongress party is not a part of Gupkar alliance or PeopleтАЩs Alliance for Gupkar Declaration.тАЭ  In 2015, BJP entered into an alliance with PDP as no party could get a majority in 2014 Assembly polls in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. However, in 2018, BJP pulled out of its coalition government with the PDP.  Parties including the National Conference, PDP, Peoples Conference and CPI(M), formed the PeopleтАЩs Alliance for Gupkar Declaration and are fighting the maiden District Development Council (DDC) elections together.  While Farooq Abdullah was chosen as president of the PeopleтАЩs Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, Mehbooba Mufti was picked to play a role of vice-president.  On October 24, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah had said that the PAGD has been formed to ensure the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are restored. тАЬAll of us united that the pre-August 5th, 2019 position must be restored,тАЭ he added.  The DDC polls will be conducted in Jammu and Kashmir in eight phases between November 28 and December 19, and the counting of votes will take place on December 22.  https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-bjp-pdp-alliance-to-bring-back-terror-in-j-k-asks-kapil-sibal-after-shah-s-gupkar-gang-remark/story-JI033SrQ4GOhT5xbirYkML.html  --------  Madhya Pradesh plans law to check тАШrising love jihadтАЩ with five-year prison term  by Iram Siddique  November 18, 2020  The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is planning to introduce a Bill in the next session of the state Assembly to тАЬcheck rising incidents of love jihadтАЭ, state Home Minister Narottam Mishra said on Tuesday.  The Bill, to be called Dharma Swatantrya (Freedom of Religion) Bill, 2020, proposes five years of rigorous imprisonment for тАЬluring a person through fraud and forcing marriage by religious conversionтАЭ, Mishra told reporters, adding that such an offence would be non-bailable.  The Bill, modelled on the MP Dharma Swatantrya Adhiniyam, 1968, aims to prevent conversion through marriage and will not only prohibit conversion or attempt to convert by use of financial тАЬallurementтАЭ, as specified in the earlier Bill, but also add тАЬconversion through fraudтАЭ and тАЬmisrepresentationтАЭ, along with тАЬforceтАЭ.  The earlier Act only specified imprisonment of up to one year, but the new Bill, which will supersede the existing Act, will be more stringent, Mishra said.  Other proposed provisions include making it mandatory for the kin of the person тАЬbeing forced to convert to another faith for the purpose of marriageтАЭ to file a complaint.  Talking to The Indian Express, Mishra said, тАЬSuch incidents are on the rise, which you call тАШlove jihadтАЩ. Such cases are on the rise in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.тАЭ  When asked about the rise in alleged тАШlove jihadтАЩ cases, Mishra said there are intelligence reports of such cases and тАЬthatтАЩs the basis for making this lawтАЭ.  An official from the state government said statistics showing a rise in such cases were тАЬnot immediately availableтАЭ.  Mishra added the Bill would have a provision to declare such marriages тАЬnull and voidтАЭ. However, such a move will need the concurrence of the Central government since both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act are Central Acts.  When asked about this, Mishra said, тАЬWe are working on the details but will take the Central governmentтАЩs view into consideration before finalising it.тАЭ  Under the proposed Bill, those assisting тАЬforced conversions for marriageтАЭ will be made co-accused, Mishra told reporters.  The draft proposal of the Bill will be sent for vetting to the law department and is expected to be finalised over the next two weeks. Mishra said the Bill is expected to be introduced in the state Assembly by December.  A senior official from the state government said, тАЬThe previous Act prohibiting religious conversion enforced in 1968 was upheld by the High Court in 1977. This is modelled on it and we see no reason why it wonтАЩt be approved.тАЭ  Earlier, the Madhya Pradesh government had in a letter to the Uttar Pradesh government sought details of the law being proposed by them to counter love jihad.  BJP-ruled Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are also moving in the direction of a law against religious conversion in the name of тАЬlove jihadтАЭ.  On Tuesday, after chairing a ministry meeting to discuss the modalities for such a law, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said, тАЬA strict law will be enacted to control love jihad cases in Haryana. A committee shall be constituted to draft this law.  https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sc-slams-centre-affidavit-on-tablighi-reporting-silent-on-tv-content-7055231/  --------  Omar, Mufti react, say itтАЩs a legitimate political alliance  Nov 18, 2020  SRINAGAR: Omar Abdullah of National Conference and Mehbooba Mufti of PDP, constituents of the Gupkar Alliance, have hit out at Amit Shah for saying that the alliance was involving foreign forces to intervene in J&K.

The elections were held on Sunday in Gilgit-Baltistan in 24 constituencies of the Legislative Assembly.  Thousands of people turned up on the streets, carrying flags to protest against the rigged polls.  While speaking to his supporters, Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said: ""Your mandate has been stolen. The votes of Gilgit-Baltistan have been stolen.""  Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz Sharif was also seen addressing a crowd of protesters.  One of the protesters said: ""Whoever oppresses us, we will stand up against them and die fighting. Today, through pre-poll rigging our mandate has been stolen. Till our demands are not met, we will continue protesting.""  Meanwhile, human rights activist Amjad Ayub Mirza said that the Gilgit-Baltistan elections were a 'scam'.  ""There has been a scam in the Gilgit-Baltistan elections. From three areas, the polling boxes were stolen, and so, the two big leaders of Pakistan, Bilawal and Maryam, have refused to accept the outcome of the elections. Bilawal has also stated that if the three seats, which were previously won by PPP but later lost through a scam, are not returned, he will not leave Gilgit-Baltistan,"" said Mirza.  According to sources, thousands of people had taken to the streets in Skardu and Gilgit areas against vote-rigging in the elections on Monday, with incidents of several tires being set on fire and many roads blocked for hours were reported in the region.  Bilawal had alleged rigging in three constituencies. Addressing a sit-in in Gilgit, he said rigging was made to snatch the mandate of PPP in Gilgit 1, Ghizer 3 and a constituency in Skardu.  Dawn quoted Bilawal as saying at a press conference that results were manipulated ""overnight"" for elections on seats that the PPP was winning and the party was declared to have lost them during the day.  In addition, PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz Sharif claimed that Imran Khan's PTI won a few seats in Gilgit Baltistan's elections through 'rigging', 'bullying', and with the help of turncoats.  Maryam, on her Twitter, wrote that Imran's PTI failing to achieve an absolute majority in the northern region (illegally occupied) is a ""shameful defeat"" for the incumbent government, the News International reported.  Elections were held amidst relentless protest by the people of Gilgit Baltistan against the Pakistan government's ""illegal occupation"" in the region.  India has slammed Pakistan for its decision to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan and said any action to alter the status of the militarily-occupied region has no legal basis.  https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/massive-protests-continue-in-gilgit-baltistan-against-rigged-elections-by-imran-khans-pti-govt/articleshow/79275471.cms  --------  Prosperity linked with commitment to democracy, says army chief  Saleem Shahid  18 Nov 2020  QUETTA: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa visited the provincial capital on Tuesday and interacted with the participants of a workshop.  The National Workshop Balochistan aims to enhance understanding of the participants about critical national security issues, timely decision-making process, national security management system and elements of national power.  Speaking on the occasion, the COAS said progress and stability in Balochistan was critical to the prosperity of Pakistan. All stakeholders, including the army, had synergised their efforts for socio-economic uplift of the people of Balochistan, he added.  The army chief said measures like fencing of borders with Afghanistan and Iran, effective articulation of security apparatus deployed across the province and Quetta Safe City project would have positive impact on the overall security paradigm of Balochistan. Nefar┬нious efforts of hostile elements to foment terrorism and create chaos in the province would not be allowed to succeed, he emphasised.  The COAS reiterated that PakistanтАЩs peace and prosperity were linked with commitment to democracy and its values.  Later, Gen Bajwa visited School of Infantry and Tactics.  He was briefed on new training modules, online examination systems enacted for young leadership and innovative systems/techniques being incorporated in training regime.  The COAS asked the faculty and students to stay abreast with developments in modern warfare. He appreciated the hard work and dedication of the faculty and staff in grooming the young officers and soldiers for taking on the future challenges befittingly.

The decision marks the first time a peer has ever been recommended for expulsion.  тАЬLord Ahmed breached the Code of Conduct by failing to act on his personal honour in the discharge of his parliamentary activities by agreeing to use his position as a member of the House to help a member of the public but then; sexually assaulting the complainant, lying to the complainant about his intentions to help her with a complaint to the Metropolitan Police regarding exploitation by a faith healer, exploiting the complainant emotionally and sexually despite knowing she was vulnerable,тАЭ read the preamble to the report published on Tuesday.  House of Lords inquiry recommends his expulsion for misconduct and dishonesty  The report added: тАЬ...the Commissioner found that Lord Ahmed knew that he was dealing with a vulnerable person, who was undergoing treatment for anxiety and depression and who had already made clear that she did not want a sexual relationship. He nonetheless misleadingly induced her to visit him at his house under the pretext of offering to assist her as a member of the House of LordsтАжтАЭ  UK media reports suggest 43-year-old Tahira Zaman approached Lord Nazir three years ago in the hope that he would help her in getting the police to investigate a Muslim healer who she thought was a danger to women.  Ms Zaman told BBC that Lord Nazir repeatedly asked her for dinner and she finally agreed.  Weeks after she contacted him about the case, he asked her to come to his east London home. The two had a consensual sexual relationship. However, she said: тАЬI was looking for help and he took advantage of me. He abused his power.тАЭ  Lord Nazir hails from Azad Kashmir and was made a life peer on the recommendation of Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1998. Currently living in Rotherham, he sat in the House until he retired this week.  Many of his political activities relate to advocating for the Muslim community both in the UK and abroad. In his Twitter bio, he describes himself as тАЬa campaigner for KashmirisтАЭ and the тАЬfirst Muslim member appointed to the House for lifeтАЭ. He resigned from the Labour party in 2013.  He came to Pakistan to meet Prime Minister Imran Khan after his victory in the 2018 general elections. The two discussed how to improve PakistanтАЩs relations globally.  In the inquiry report, the head of the committee found тАЬthat, while Lord Ahmed was taking no steps to help Ms Zaman for the majority of their interactions, he allowed and encouraged her to believe that he wasтАЭ.  The commissioner added: тАЬ[On] important issues Lord Ahmed persistently gave deliberately inaccurate and misleading accounts to conceal his behaviour towards Ms Zaman тАж I consider that in conducting himself in this manner he has failed genuinely to cooperate with my investigation. He has failed to act on his personal honour, as evidenced.тАЭ  Although Lord Nazir admitted to having a brief relationship with the complainant, тАЬhe did not accept that any of the potential breaches of the Code of Conduct had taken placeтАЭ, the report said.  In a statement last year, he told BBC: тАЬI completely deny the allegation that I have exploited my position to pursue an inappropriate relationship with any member of the public (vulnerable or otherwise) or that I have acted inappropriately in the presence of women either in my personal or professional capacity.тАЭ  Child abuse trial pending  In a separate case, the former Labour peer Lord Nazir and two of his brothers in 2019 were charged with historical sexual offences against minors. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.  Lord Nazir was charged with serious sexual assault against a boy under the age of 11 and the indecent assault of the same boy; two counts of attempting to rape a girl who was under the age of 16. All charges relate to dates between 1971 and 1974.  His brother Mohamed Farouq was charged with four counts of indecent assault against a boy. One of these counts relates to when the boy was under eight, in the late 1960s. His other brother Mohammed Tariq was charged with two counts of indecent assault against a boy under 11.  The trial was set to commence in January this year but has been postponed to resume in January 2021 because of Covid-19 restrictions on jury trials.  https://www.dawn.com/news/1590926/uk-committee-publishes-scathing-report-on-lord-nazir  --------  Breaking news of Osama raid to Pakistan was easier than thought, says Obama  Anwar Iqbal  18 Nov 2020  WASHINGTON: Barack Obama has claimed in his memoirs that breaking the news to Pakistan of a US raid into Abbottabad to kill Osama bin Laden was easier than he had expected as the then president Asif Ali Zardari understood the US position.  The book тАФ тАЬA Promised LandтАЭ тАФ was released on Tuesday and gives a blow-by-blow account of the raid by American commandos that killed the worldтАЩs most wanted terrorist on May 2, 2011 inside his compound in Abbottabad.  Obama wrote that he knew ordering a military strike inside an allied state violated its sovereignty but he decided to go for it as he did not want to miss the chance to take out the Al Qaeda leader.  тАЬWhatever we chose to do in Abbottabad, then, would involve violating the territory of a putative ally in the most egregious way possible, short of war- raising both the diplomatic stakes and the operational complexities,тАЭ he wrote.  The former US president revealed that his two closest aides, the then vice president Joe Biden and defence secretary Robert Gates opposed the raid. The revelation shows why Obama released the book after the Nov. 3 elections as it would have hurt Biden, who is now the President-elect.  After the raid, Obama called many American and world leaders, including the then president of Pakistan.  Zardari тАЬshowed genuine emotion, recalling how his wife, Benazir Bhutto, had been killed by extremists with reported ties to Al Qaeda,тАЭ Obama wrote.  тАЬI expected my most difficult call to be with PakistanтАЩs beleaguered president, Asif Ali Zardari, who would surely face a backlash at home over our violation of Pakistani sovereignty,тАЭ he wrote.  тАЬWhen I reached him, however, he expressed congratulations and support. тАШWhatever the fallout,' he said, тАШitтАЩs very good news'.""  Obama then asked his military Chief, Mike Mullen, to call his counterpart in Pakistan.  тАЬMullen had put a call in to PakistanтАЩs army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and while the conversation had been polite, Kayani had requested that we come clean on the raid and its target as quickly as possible in order to help his people manage the reaction of the Pakistani public,тАЭ he said.  Obama said he ruled out involving Pakistan in the raid because he believed that certain elements inside Pakistan maintained links to the Taliban and perhaps even Al Qaeda.  He wrote that when it became increasingly clear that Bin Laden was living in a hideout in Abbottabad, he decided to go for the kill.  тАЬBased on what IтАЩd heard, I decided we had enough information to begin developing options for an attack on the compound. While the CIA team continued to work on identifying the Pacer, I asked Tom Donilon and John Brennan to explore what a raid would look like,тАЭ he wrote.  тАЬThe need for secrecy added to the challenge; if even the slightest hint of our lead on bin Laden leaked, we knew our opportunity would be lost. As a result, only a handful of people across the entire federal government were read into the planning phase of the operation,тАЭ he said.  Although he acknowledged that тАЬPakistanтАЩs government cooperated with us on a host of counterterrorism operations and provided a vital supply path for our forces in Afghanistan,тАЭ he decided not to share the information with Islamabad.  тАЬThe fact that the Abbottabad compound was just a few miles from the Pakistan militaryтАЩs equivalent of West Point only heightened the possibility that anything we told the Pakistanis could end up tipping off our target,тАЭ he added.  https://www.dawn.com/news/1590958/breaking-news-of-osama-raid-to-pakistan-was-easier-than-thought-says-obama  --------   South Asia   Abdullah Abdullah: US, Taliban Agreement No Basis for Peace Talks in Afghanistan  2020-November-17  тАЬThe peace agreement between the US and the Taliban may not be the basis for all talks in peace negotiations with the Taliban,тАЭ Abdullah was quoted by Tolou News as saying on Tuesday.

Meantime, The Taliban in Afghanistan last Tuesday urged US President-elect Joe Biden to stay committed to the Doha peace accord with the group, signed during the Donald Trump administration.  In its initial public response to the victory of Democrat Joe Biden in the US presidential elections, the Taliban said in a statement that the Doha agreement was ""an excellent document for bringing an end to the war and for a better future for both countries.""  The statement posted on the group's propaganda site addressed Biden and future US administrations that withdrawing all American forces from Afghanistan would be in the interest of both ""our peoples and our nations.""

Saleh wrote on his Facebook page, Wednesday, that a member of the ISIS-Taliban named тАЬEzatullahтАЭ had been arrested.  The first vice president says the man wanted to extort $ 100,000 from money changers and previously had thrown a hand grenade at them to set a grown fear among the Shroves.  Saleh also said that another Taliban member, тАЬMohammad ZahirтАЭ, who had recently killed a national security official, had also been detained by security forces.

Saudi authorities recently announced that a seven-decade-old sponsorship system, known as kafala, was to be abolished.  The reforms, due to come into effect in March, are aimed at making the Saudi labor market more attractive by granting more than 10 million foreign workers the right to change jobs and leave the country without employersтАЩ permission.  Shameem Ahmed Chowdhury Noman, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA), told Arab News: тАЬWe welcome the decision of the Saudi government. ItтАЩs a very positive move. Now the workers can easily change their jobs which will definitely help them explore better opportunities in the job market of the Kingdom.тАЭ  He said that his organization was eagerly waiting to learn more about the new system and was looking forward to its implementation.  Saudi Arabia is the single largest destination for Bangladeshi migrant workers and more than 2 million of them are living in the Kingdom.  Every year, they send billions of dollars back to their home country. Remittances from Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia reached $4 billion in the last fiscal year, according to data from the Bangladeshi Bureau of Manpower, Employment, and Training (BMET).  Shariful Hasan, migration head at Bangladesh-based international development agency BRAC, told Arab News that the new system would make life easier for migrant workers.  тАЬItтАЩs obvious that migrant workers will be benefitted through the reformation of the kafala system,тАЭ he said.  Under the current kafala system, migrant workers are generally bound to one employer.  Bangladeshi workers praised the new system which will base the relationship between employers and workers on a standard contract certified by the government, and will allow workers to apply directly for services via an e-government portal, instead of a mandatory employersтАЩ approval.  тАЬMy shop is not doing good business since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and I was planning to switch over the job. Now, I can take the decision on my own,тАЭ migrant worker Mohammed Hossain told Arab News.  Shams Joarder, who plans to work in Saudi Arabia, said the reform was a great relief as it would allow workers to search for new jobs on the expiry of their contracts while still residing in the Kingdom. тАЬNow we can all change employer without any hassle,тАЭ he added.  https://www.arabnews.com/node/1764461/world  --------   North America   After 9/11, US military should have invaded Saudi Arabia  17 November 2020  By Tony Gosling  So it's very interesting that President Trump is using his last month or so in power to do this drawdown of troops, 2,000 from Afghanistan, which is about 40% of the contingent there, and 500 from Iraq, which is 20% of the troops in Iraq.  I mean, he's had to replace his defense secretary to do this, replacing him with Chris Miller which is interesting because it shows that the previous defense secretary basically wasn't cooperating with the president, even though he chooses these people.  He's given often in this sort of situation, the President is given a choice of people, none of whom agree with him, but he's now in his last month asserting himself a bit more. Now, what Chris Miller has said the new defense secretary is that he doesn't want this perpetual war, which is great news.  Although it's I'm afraid it's 19 years, which is too late. You know, itтАЩs 19 years to 2001 when the Americans went into Afghanistan under George Bush Jr., and under what pretext ? Under the pretext of these 9/11 attacks which are actually carried out by Saudi Arabia.  So maybe back in 2001, the US military should have been going into Saudi Arabia, to occupy Saudi Arabia instead.  I mean it was just an excuse to go into Afghanistan at the time. It was a media hype around bin Laden, hiding in these fictitious caves in Afghanistan, and it's about time that these troops were withdrawn, absolutely right.  But the other thing to look at here is this perpetual war is also what we're getting now is it's being replaced, or in fact added to domestically with the perpetual war on the virus, so that this perpetual war idea seems to be spreading like a virus itself within the deep state in the United States.  Also worth mentioning that you've got to look at individual presidents as individuals, like for example President John F Kennedy was very much... he was in charge, he wanted to be in charge. He wasn't co-opted by the deep state or the CIA to be their little poodle president.  And what we saw with Trump was somebody that they were having to manage him right the way through. They would have to push him, cajole him, etc into doing what they wanted. And he kept his promise at no big new wars. He was making all sorts of threats against North Korea, but then he went and made friends with Kim Jong-un.  So it's very interesting that I think we're going back now to a George Bush Jr., an Obama-type president, with Biden, somebody who the deep state know they can just write a script for him and he'll read it out for them.  So the end of the Trump era I think people are going to be a little bit looking back with nostalgia towards President Trump - somebody that when he was stood in front of the podium and the microphone was actually speaking his mind and actually kept his promise not to start new wars.  *Beginning his working life in the aviation industry and trained by the BBC, Tony Gosling is a British land rights activist, historian, and investigative radio journalist.

He further asserted that TrumpтАЩs decision тАЬis based on continuous engagement with his national security Cabinet for the past several months, including ongoing discussions with me and my colleagues across the United States government.тАЭ  The move comes on the heels of Trumps ouster of Defense Secretary Mark Esper, which led to a flurry of resignations at the Pentagon, yielding gaps now filled by TrumpтАЩs loyalist.  National security adviser Robert OтАЩBrien told reporters at the White House that the Trump campaign has kept its promise of returning US troops back home.  тАЬFour years ago, President Trump ran on a promise to put a stop to AmericaтАЩs endless wars,тАЭ OтАЩBrien said. тАЬPresident Trump is keeping that promise to the American people.тАЭ  He further emphasized that this has been the administrationтАЩs policy from the get-go.  тАЬBy May, it is President Trump's hope that they will all come home safely and in their entirety,тАЭ OтАЩBrien said. тАЬI want to reiterate that this policy is not new. This has been the presidentтАЩs policy since he took office.тАЭ  In an agreement reached between the US and the Taliban in February, the Trump administration promised to pull out all its troops by mid-2021 in return for the Taliban to stop their attacks on US-led occupation foreign forces in Afghanistan.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/17/638823/US-to-pull-some-2,500-troops-from-Afghanistan,-Iraq  --------  Sudan minister reveals US pressured Sudan to normalize with Israel  17 November 2020  US President Donald Trump placed Sudan under тАЬheavy pressureтАЭ to normalize relations with the occupying regime of Israel and sought to use the normalization deal as a card in his favor during the US presidential election on November 3, a Sudanese government minister has told Press TV.  SudanтАЩs Minister of Information Faisal Mohamed Saleh made the revelation in an exclusive interview with Press TVтАЩs correspondent in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, Ahmed Kaballo, on Monday.  Trump announced at the White House in October that Sudan and Israel had agreed to normalize relations. Sudan thus became the third Arab country тАФ after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain тАФ to agree to a normalization deal with Israel since August.  But no signing ceremony has been held between Sudan and Israel so far.  SudanтАЩs Acting Foreign Minister Omar Gamareldin has said the accord would depend on approval from its yet-to-be formed legislative council under a power-sharing deal between the countryтАЩs military and civilian leaders.  The US has promised to remove Sudan from WashingtonтАЩs list of so-called state sponsors of terrorism (SST). That has widely been seen as the sole incentive for SudanтАЩs normalization with the Israeli regime.  тАЬIn the last few months, the question of normalization with Israel was raised and that was not raised only with Sudan, as you may see, with Emirates, Bahrain, and other countries. And we insisted on two things, the separation of the two issues. We used to say to them, and that was said to US Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo when he came to Sudan, that these are two separate issues, delisting Sudan from SST, [which] we are negotiating on that for 17 or 18 months, and normalization with Israel, that is a very controversial issue,тАЭ Saleh told Press TV on Monday.  тАЬOur response to him (Trump) was that we are a transitional government and this issue is not one of our mandateтАж This should be left to an elected government to discussтАж Then, the American pressure on Sudan startedтАж,тАЭ the Sudanese minister said.  тАЬHe (Trump) used to raise the issues until maybe the last two weeks before the American election, and I think Sudan was used as a card in the election,тАЭ he added.  Trump had been attempting to use the normalization deals as foreign policy achievements in the run-up to the November election. Both Israeli and US officials had repeatedly hinted since August that other Arab countries would follow suit.  Trump was declared the loser of the presidential election.  The Sudanese minister went on to say that, тАЬTrump wanted to have some cards in his favor. Part of it was convincing some Arab countries to normalize relationship with Israel. So it was linked directly, Sudan was put under very heavy pressure.тАЭ  тАЬIt was said clearly this is linked, [that] тАШif you want Sudan to be delisted from the SST, then you have to normalize relationship with Israel.тАЩ It was a very difficult situation,тАЭ he added.  Defending his country against the illegal sanctions by the US administration, Saleh said, тАЬSudanese people have nothing to do with terrorism and that was an act of our state government and it is not fair. The Sudanese people should continue paying the price of that because the old regime hated Sudanese people more than they hated the Americans or the people of other countries. So we shouldnтАЩt pay the price twice, we have paid the price for 30 years.тАЭ  Sudan was put on the so-called terrorism list in 1993 over allegations that its ousted ruler, Omar al-Bashir, was supporting terrorism. Under Bashir, Sudan was an enemy of the Israeli regime.  SudanтАЩs inclusion on the list has made it difficult for the transitional government to access debt relief.  All Palestinian officials have roundly condemned the normalization deals as betrayals of their cause.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/17/638807/Sudan-minister-reveals-US-pressured-Sudan-to-normalize-with-Israel-exclusive  --------  Accused Canadian Neo-Nazi Soldier Offered U.S. Terror Group Paramilitary Training  17.11.20  A former Canadian soldier facing terrorism-related charges in the U.S. promised fellow members of a neo-Nazi terror group that he could train them at a secretive paramilitary camp in the U.S.  Patrik Mathews, 27, made the comments in a call with members of the Base, a recording of which was obtained by VICE News.  Mathews disappeared in August 2019 along the U.S.-Canada border near Minnesota only to reappear months later in handcuffs after a January 2020 FBI raid in Delaware. In the January phone call, Mathews is heard recounting how he could drill the group in military tactics at a paramilitary camp that was to be held in Michigan later that month.  тАЬWe want to go from point A, to point B [with] as much stealth as possible,тАЭ he said in the call. тАЬAnd then when we're there, we strike like thunder. At least I see that being proper guerrilla operations.тАЭ  Mathews, arrested along with two other members of the Maryland cell of the Base, was allegedly plotting to shoot up a gun-rights rally in Virginia and derail trainsтАФattacks meant to help incite a тАЬSecond Civil WarтАЭтАФbefore the FBI intervened.  Mathews has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer, Joseph Balter, filed a series of motions to quash evidence pointing to MathewsтАЩ role in the plot. Balter did not respond to a request for comment from VICE News.  During the call, Mathews said he could lead a training program built around the models of guerilla warfare and тАЬsmall unit tacticsтАЭ common among jihadist organizations and insurgencies in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. (In October 2019, at a separate paramilitary training camp held in Georgia, Mathews also allegedly trained members of the Base in military drills.)  тАЬI know how to teach what I've been trained in,тАЭ said Mathews, who went under the pseudonyms ""PunishedSnake"" and ""Dave"" in the BaseтАЩs encrypted chat. тАЬSo what I figured out in terms of what I learned or somebody that looks like me, so to speak, learned from the military, that I believe can apply to guerrilla warfare is: recce (reconnaissance) patrols, maybe some section; like a fire and move type stuff. Aside from that, it's more just understanding how the military operates. And then from there, it's just [тАж] patrolling, it's like how to use terrain so that you can be max stealth.тАЭ  At the time of the phone call in early January, Mathews had been in the U.S. illegally for nearly five months. One of his co-conspirators, Brian Lemley Jr., an American veteran of the war in Iraq who went by the alias ""CantGoBack"" while operating as a cell leader for the Base, harbored the Canadian in a series of safehouses in Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, according to authorities. (In the same call, Lemley seemingly admits to hiding тАЬSnakeтАЭ and helping him freely move around inside the U.S.). Lemley, who is facing several federal charges of his own, did not respond to a request for comment sent through his attorney.  Mathews was a trained combat engineer and reservist in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), but was booted from the military once his ties to the Base came to light in the summer of 2019 following a report in the Winnipeg Free Press. According to court documents, after the RCMP, CanadaтАЩs federal police force, raided his home and seized multiple weapons, Mathews went on the lam and was covertly ferried across the border by members of the Base.  The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), which has well documented issue with the far-right joining its ranks, declined to comment on Mathews allegedly using his military taught skills to train other members of the Base.  The call also revealed some of the internal problems plaguing the Base at the time, including personal grudges that spilled over into death threats. Lemley and Mathews described ongoing issues with the Georgia cell leader, Luke Austin Lane, who went by ""TMB"" or ""The Militant Buddhist"" in the groupтАЩs encrypted chat room.  тАЬHe kind of urged a fatwa,тАЭ said Mathews. тАЬIf we say anything in particular, if I say anything that, oh, I don't know, he is going to use his extensive reach and God knows what he can do to, I don't know, [hurt] us with something.тАЭ  Do you have information about the Base or other extremist groups? WeтАЩd love to hear from you. You can contact Mack Lamoureux and Ben Makuch securely on Wire at @benmakuch and @mlamoureux, or by email at mack.lamoureux@vice.com or ben.makuch@vice.com.  Lemley mentions that prior to the Georgia training camp, he had contacted the groupтАЩs leader, Rinaldo Nazzaro, a New Jersey native and ex-Pentagon contractor now living in Russia (with possible links to the Kremlin, which he denies), about LaneтАЩs instability. тАЬSo when we went down to the Georgia meet, I was telling [Nazzaro] тАШYou know, like there's a huge problem.тАЩтАЭ  The death threats against members of the Base were first revealed in an FBI affidavit against three Georgia members, including Lane, who were raided by the FBI days after the Maryland arrests, for a plot to assassinate a local antifascist activist and his wife. The operation to takedown Lane and the other cell members in Georgia, included an undercover agent who infiltrated the Base for close to five months.  The Base, along with the Atomwaffen DivisionтАФa parallel neo-Nazi organization with a similar terroristic mantraтАФhas been the subject of a broader nationwide FBI counterterrorism operation resulting in the arrests of several accerlationist terror suspects, including another member of the Base in Wisconsin and Justen Watkins, 25 (whose alias was ""AK""), the Michigan cell leader that was supposed to host the paramilitary camp Mathews spoke of.  Mathews is due to appear in court again in January.  https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzdaj/accused-canadian-neo-nazi-soldier-offered-us-terror-group-paramilitary-training?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1726020_  --------   Europe   Armenians return to Nagorno-Karabakh after Russia-brokered cease-fire with Azerbaijan  17 November 2020  Joyous scenes of smiles and hugs could be seen Tuesday on the main square of Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, as ethnic Armenians returned to their homeland a week after a cease-fire between Armenia and Azerbaijan halted the fighting that had raged over the separatist region for more than six weeks.  The Moscow-brokered truce called for territorial concessions in favor of Azerbaijan and left many Armenians bitter, but allowed those who fled from the violence to return to their homes.  For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.  тАЬI feel great because IтАЩm coming back to my sons,тАЭ said None Agasyan, whose two sons were injured during the fighting.  According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian peacekeepers deployed to the region in accordance with the cease-fire agreement have accompanied more than 1,200 people returning to Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia since Saturday. TurkeyтАЩs parliament, meanwhile, granted President Recep Tayyip ErdoganтАЩs government permission to deploy peacekeepers to Azerbaijan to monitor the cease-fire.  Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994.  That war left not only Nagorno-Karabakh itself but substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.  Heavy fighting that flared up Sept. 27 marked the biggest escalation of a decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of people.  The truce last week stipulated that Armenia turn over control of some areas its holds outside Nagorno-KarabakhтАЩs borders to Azerbaijan. It halted the fighting after several failed attempts to establish a lasting cease-fire, but prompted mass protests in the Armenian capital Yerevan and calls for Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian's ouster.  In a sign of the political crisis deepening, Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan resigned Monday after the ministry publicly contested Pashinian's claims about the course of the peace talks. Another Cabinet member, Emergency Minister Feliks Tsolakyan, submitted his resignation on Tuesday.  On Monday evening, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian added to the pressure, saying in an address to the nation that holding an early election, which implies Pashinian stepping down, is тАЬinevitable.тАЭ  But politics appeared far away from residential buildings of Stepanakert, where residents were unpacking their belongings after returning from Armenia.  Bela Khachateryan, a doctor at a maternity clinic, found her apartment in the region's capital untouched by shelling, but without electricity or gas. Still, for Khachateryan, who came back to Stepanakert on Tuesday with her mother and daughters after nearly two months away, there is no place like home.  тАЬWherever we are staying, even with Armenians (in Yerevan), weтАЩre drawn to here, to our home, to our city,"" Khachateryan said after unpacking heavy bags with groceries she brought from Yerevan. ""We are used to this place. We love our city.тАЭ  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said the United States welcome the cease-fire and is providing $5 million in humanitarian assistance тАЬto support the operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organization and non-governmental organization partners to assist people affected by the recent fighting.тАЭ  The assistance will go towards local efforts to provide food, health, shelter, and other emergency assistance to conflict-affected persons, Pompeo said.  https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2020/11/18/Armenians-return-to-Nagorno-Karabakh-after-Russia-brokered-cease-fire-with-Azerbaijan  --------  Trial in France for extremist foiled by 3 Americans on train  17 November 2020  PARIS -- Head lowered, an Islamic State operative listened silently as a Paris judge on Monday detailed his alleged plot to unleash mass slaughter on a high-speed train before he was tackled and subdued by American vacationers whose heroics inspired Clint Eastwood to direct a Hollywood re-enactment.  Opening a month-long trial for Ayoub El Khazzani, the judge said the 31-year-old Moroccan with ties to a notorious mastermind intended to тАЬkill all the passengers"" aboard the Amsterdam to Paris train in 2015 but тАЬlost control of events.тАЭ  El Khazzani, who is on trial with three suspected accomplices, acknowledged the charges against him with a simple тАЬYes.тАЭ  He risks life in prison if convicted of attempted terrorist murder.  The heavily-armed and bare-chested El Khazzani wounded a French-American who managed to briefly yank a Kalashnikov from his hands before the three vacationing Americans took him down.  The drama on the train is portrayed by investigators as one of a series of IS-linked attacks in Europe that include the Nov. 13, 2015 massacre in Paris at a music hall and cafes that killed 130 people. A failed 2015 attack in Verviers, Belgium, and 2016 attacks in Brussels are also among them.  The suspected mastermind of the Paris massacre, Abdel Hamid Abaaoud, also worked as behind-the-scenes leader of the train attack, according to investigators. Their probe showed that Abaaoud and El Khazzani traveled together from Syria to Belgium and holed up with Chatra in a Brussels apartment.  French special forces killed Abaaoud days after the Bataclan attack.  The alleged train attack plot went awry when passengers moved in on El Khazzani.  One of the Americans who tackled the gunman told investigators that he seemed high on drugs and тАЬcompletely crazy,тАЭ the judge said.  A lawyer for the two U.S. servicemen and their friend, whose electrifying capture of El Khazzani inspired Eastwood's movie тАЬThe 15:17 to Paris"", said their heroics during the drama on Aug. 21, 2015 thwarted a тАЬslaughter.тАЭ  тАЬThis terror attack could have killed up to 300 people based on the number of ammunition that was found on the terrorist and in his bag,тАЭ said the attorney, Thibault de Montbrial.  With El Khazzani and his three alleged accomplices seated behind protective glass in a heavily-secured courtroom, the trial opening was largely taken up with procedural issues including whether EastwoodтАЩs presence is needed. That question wasn't immediately resolved. The actor-director so far hasn't responded to a summons. The three Americans hailed as heroes are to testify.  El Khazzani boarded the train in Brussels armed with a Kalashnikov, nine clips with 30 rounds each, an automatic pistol and a cutter, according to investigators. A bottle of high flammable yellow liquid also was found in black suitcase, the judge said.  His lawyer, Sarah Mauger-Poliak, said El Khazzani тАЬregrets having allowed himself to become indoctrinatedтАЭ by extremist propaganda and wants ""to demonstrate his remorse.тАЭ He wants to speak to the victims if allowed, she said.  El Khazzani, bearded under his mask and his hair pulled back in a bun, said when asked about his prison conditions after several reprimands, тАЬIt's hard,тАЭ but тАЬI deserve it.тАЭ  Three others, who were not on the train, are being tried as alleged accomplices.  Bilal Chatra, 24, an Algerian member of the Islamic State group, would have been the second man on the train but dropped out of the plot a week earlier. He left Syria for Europe a week before to set up the exit route.  Mohamed Bakkali allegedly sheltered the attackers in Budapest, Hungary, which he denies. The two were arrested in Germany in 2016. A third man, Redouane El Amrani Ezzerrifi, allegedly piloted a boat to help in their return to Europe.  The trial ties into the massacre of 130 people in Paris three months later, on Nov. 13, 2015, at the Bataclan music hall and restaurants and cafes.  Once aboard the train, El Khazzani lingered in a restroom between cars and emerged bare-chested with the Kalashnikov. One waiting passenger struggled with the attacker, then a French-American, Mark Magoolian, wrestled the Kalashnikov away тАФ before being shot himself by a pistol. He jumped in after a French banker, who has asked to remain anonymous, wrestled unsuccessfully with El Khazzani.  Spencer Stone, then a 23-year-old U.S. airman, has said he was coming out of a deep sleep when the gunman appeared. He said Alek Skarlatos, then a 22-year-old U.S. National Guardsman recently back from Afghanistan, тАЬjust hit me on the shoulder and said тАШLetтАЩs go.тАЩтАЭ  The men, all from California and following what Skarlatos has said was тАЬgut instinct,"" snapped into action. Stone and Skarlatos moved in to tackle the gunman, helped by a third man, Anthony Sadler, 23, then a student. Stone said he choked El Khazzani unconscious. A British businessman also joined the fray.  Stone, whose hand was injured by the cutter, is also credited with saving Magoolian, whose neck was squirting blood. Stone said he тАЬjust stuck two of my fingers in his hole and found what I thought to be the artery, pushed down and the bleeding stopped.тАЭ  The train rerouted to Arras, in northern France, where El Khazzani was arrested.  https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trial-france-extremist-foiled-americans-train-74228268?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1726020_  --------   Arab world   UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed, Israel's President exchange visit invitations  Tuqa Khalid  17 November 2020  Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, exchanged with Israel's President Reuven Rivlin invitations to visit their respective countries, state news agency WAM reported on Tuesday.

Any non-comprehensive deal will not achieve lasting peace and security in our region,тАЭ Prince Turki said during the 29th Annual Arab-US Policymakers Conference.  Biden was ObamaтАЩs VP and has previously expressed his willingness and intention to re-enter the JCPOA, which was heavily criticized and withdrawn from by President Donald Trump.  тАЬIranian disruptive regional behavior in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, by attacking directly and indirectly the oil installations is as much of a threat as is its nuclear program,тАЭ Prince Turki said.  Any new deal should include all issues of concern, and this means WashingtonтАЩs friends and allies need to be part of potential negotiations, Prince Turki suggested.  The JCPOA has been criticized for focusing on IranтАЩs nuclear program and ambitions without discussing TehranтАЩs terrorist proxies and militias in the region as well as its ballistic missile program.  Prince Turki also warned against American retrenchment from the Middle East, тАЬwhich widens тАж the existing strategic vacuum that is increasingly coveted by regional and other great powers.тАЭ  However, this increases the тАЬappetite of radical states and forces in the region,тАЭ he said, which is detrimental to US interests and those of its allies.  https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2020/11/17/Saudi-Arabia-s-Prince-Turki-warns-Biden-against-same-mistakes-of-Iran-nuclear-deal  --------  Iran diplomat: Saudis must drop blame game if they want to develop nuclear weapons  17 November 2020  IranтАЩs permanent representative to Vienna-based international organizations says Saudi officials should stop engaging in blame-shifting if Riyadh is down the path of developing nuclear weapons and seeks to invent an excuse for avoiding cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  In two tweets posted late on Tuesday, Kazem Gharibabadi responded to recent anti-Iranian remarks by Saudi ArabiaтАЩs Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir, who told the DPA news agency in a recent interview that the kingdom тАЬreserves the rightтАЭ to arm itself with nuclear weapons if Iran cannot be stopped from making one.  тАЬScapegoating and fearmongering are two common and classic methods used by demagogues!тАЭ Gharibabadi wrote.  тАЬIf you want to pursue a nuclear weapon program, or you are seeking for an excuse to justify your lack of cooperation with the IAEA or your outdated safeguard system, at least have the courage to admit it and pay the price for it, donтАЩt blame your wrongdoings on others by lies,тАЭ he added.  RiyadhтАЩs nuclear ambitions have become a source of heightened concern for the global community in recent years, especially after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first hinted in 2018 that the kingdom may go for nukes.  During a trip to the US in mid-March 2018, the heir to the Saudi throne said if Iran develops a nuclear bomb, тАЬwe will follow suit as soon as possible.тАЭ  The kingdom has so far kept its nuclear activities secret, defying calls for it to implement the IAEAтАЩs Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements, a system of inspection and verification of the peaceful uses of nuclear materials.  Reports about Saudi ArabiaтАЩs undeclared nuclear activities were confirmed earlier this year by satellite images, which showed a large compound in a suspicious location in the heart of the desert.  Citing Western officials, The Wall Street Journal reported in early August that Saudi Arabia, with Chinese help, has built a facility for extraction of yellowcake from uranium ore near the remote town of al-Ula.  The New York Times also said American intelligence agencies had spotted what appeared to be an undeclared nuclear site not too far from the town of al-Uyaynah, located 30 kilometers northwest of Riyadh, and its Solar Village.  The agencies, the report said, are scrutinizing attempts by the kingdom to build up ability to produce nuclear fuel that could potentially lead to the development of nuclear weapons.  Unlike Saudi Arabia, Iran showed the peaceful nature of its nuclear program to the world by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with six world states тАФ namely the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China тАФ in 2015. The nuclear deal was also ratified in the form of a UN Security Council Resolution 2231.  The US, however, unilaterally pulled out of the deal and re-imposed unilateral sanctions against Tehran in a move supported by the regimes in Saudi Arabia and Israel.  Tehran remained fully compliant with the JCPOA for an entire year as confirmed by the IAEA, waiting for the co-signatories to fulfill their end of the bargain, but as the European parties failed to do so, it moved in May 2019 to suspend parts of its commitments with the AgencyтАЩs supervision under Articles 26 and 36 of the deal covering TehranтАЩs legal rights.  Iran says its retaliatory measures are reversible as soon as the other sides fulfill their contractual obligations.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/18/638840/Iran-Saudi-nuclear  --------  Iraqi military says four rockets struck BaghdadтАЩs Green Zone  18 November 2020  The Iraqi military says four rockets have targeted the Green Zone in the capital Baghdad, an area that houses government buildings and foreign missions, including the US embassy.  The Iraqi military announced in a statement on Tuesday that four Katyusha rockets had landed near the US Embassy in the heavily fortified Baghdad Green Zone, with reports of sirens having gone off in the diplomatic mission.  The statement added that the rockets had been fired from the New Baghdad district located in the east of the capital.  #╪╣╪з╪м┘Д |╪│┘В┘И╪╖ 4 ╪╡┘И╪з╪▒┘К╪о ╪╣┘Д┘Й ╪з┘Д┘Е┘Ж╪╖┘В╪й ╪з┘Д╪о╪╢╪▒╪з╪б╪М ╪г╪╖┘Д┘В╪к ┘Е┘Ж ┘Е┘Ж╪╖┘В╪й ╪н┘К ╪з┘Д╪г┘Е┘К┘Ж ╪з┘Д╪л╪з┘Ж┘К╪й ┘Б┘К ╪┤╪▒┘В ╪и╪║╪п╪з╪п pic.twitter.com/vmAazOjT3o  тАФ ╪┤╪и┘Г╪й ╪з┘Д╪╡╪н╪з┘Б╪й ╪з┘Д╪╣╪▒╪з┘В┘К╪й +INP (@INPPLUSarabi) November 17, 2020  There were no immediate words on possible damage or casualties, but Iraqi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press news agency that at least two Iraqi security personnel had sustained injuries in the attack.  The heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, which hosts foreign diplomatic sites and government buildings, has been frequently targeted by rockets and explosives in the past few years.  Washington, each time, has been quick to point the finger at popular anti-terror groups, which are now integrated into Iraq's armed forces.  The US has time and again targeted positions of IraqтАЩs Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), also known as Hashd al-ShaтАЩabi, after blaming the major anti-terror force for the rocket attacks. The popular group has strongly denied any involvement in the strikes.  The Tuesday incident marks the first such attack after anti-terror groups in Iraq agreed last month to stop military operations against US and foreign forces in Iraq to allow them to leave the Arab country.  Anti-American sentiments have been running high in Iraq since the US assassinated IranтАЩs anti-terror commander Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, and the deputy head of IraqтАЩs Popular Mobilization Units, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in Baghdad on January 3.  Just days later, Iraqi lawmakers unanimously passed a bill mandating the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq.  The US has refused to withdraw its troops, with US President Donald Trump balking at the idea with the threat to seize Iraq's oil money held in bank accounts in the United States.  Iraqi resistance groups have pledged to take up arms against US forces if Washington fails to comply with the parliamentary order.  The US announced on Tuesday that it would slash troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq to 2,500 in each country, their lowest levels in nearly 20 years of invasion.  Washington still has some 3,000 troops stationed across Iraq.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/18/638827/Iraqi-military-rockets-Green-Zone-Baghdad  --------  Iraqi army jets target Daesh remnants in eastern Diyala Province  17 November 2020  The Iraqi Army F-16 aircraft have targeted the positions of remaining Daesh terrorists in the eastern province of Diyala.  The Iraqi Security Information Cell said in a statement that the aerial operation was conducted on DiyalaтАЩs Khanaqin district on Tuesday morning.  Groups of armed terrorists have recently increased their activities in Diyala as well as the provinces of al-Anbar and Saladin, prompting the Iraqi armed forces and the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) to jointly carry out several large-scale operations, arrest a number of militants and destroy their hideouts, the statement read.  Lately, it added, DiyalaтАЩs al-Muqdadiya and Abi Sayda districts have witnessed attacks against security forces, civilians and local figures.  On Saturday, the Security Information Cell announced that Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had called for the reinforcement of the armed forces in Diyala in the face of terrorists.  Almost two dozen executed on terrorism charges  On Monday, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said in a statement that 21 convicted terrorists and murderers had been hanged at a prison in the southern city of Nasiriyah.  Among those executed were people involved in two deadly attacks in the city of Tal Afar, in northern Nineveh Province, according to the statement.  It did not elaborate on the identities of the executed people or their convictions.  Daesh began a terror campaign in Iraq in 2014, overrunning vast swathes in lightning attacks.  The PMU or Hashd al-ShaтАЩabi played a major role in reinforcing the Iraqi army, which had suffered heavy setbacks against the Takfiri elements.  Iraq declared victory over Daesh in December 2017 after a three-year counter-terrorism military campaign, which also had the support of neighboring Iran.  The terror outfitтАЩs remnants, though, keep staging sporadic attacks across Iraq, attempting to regroup and unleash new era violence.  Daesh has intensified its terrorist attacks in Iraq since January, when the United States assassinated top Iranian anti-terror commander Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani and PMUтАЩs deputy commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Baghdad International Airport.  The two commanders were highly popular because of the key role they played in eliminating Daesh in the region.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/17/638771/Iraqi-army-jets-target-Daesh-remnants-in-Diyala-Province  --------  Iraqi Leader: Popular Forces Ready to Give Crushing Response to Any Threat by Trump  2020-November-17  тАЬThe resistance front is fully prepared and vigilant and will reciprocate any threat by the mad Trump with twice more powerful response,тАЭ al-Kaabi wrote on his twitter page on Tuesday.  He stressed that the resistance front will not withdraw, fail or fear, adding that occupiers will be confronted until their complete pull-out from Iraq.  In a relevant development in August, the Iraqi resistance groups in a statement threatened to target the American interests in the Arab country if the US fails to withdraw its forces from the Iraqi soil.  The statement was released concurrent with the premier's meetings with American officials at the White House -- by the resistance groups that form part of IraqтАЩs Hashd al-ShaтАЩabi or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) anti-terror force, LebanonтАЩs al-Mayadeen television network reported.  The PMU, which includes such resistance groups as the KataтАЩib Hezbollah and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, has been integrated into the Iraqi Defense Forces as a result of its successful and indispensable contribution to the countryтАЩs defeating the Daesh (ISIL or ISIS) terrorist group in late 2017.  The groups considered expulsion of the troops to be BaghdadтАЩs top priority, urging the PM to accord primacy to a law approved by the parliament that mandates the forcesтАЩ withdrawal.  The legislature passed the law in January shortly after a US drone strike assassinated Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of IranтАЩs Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the PMUтАЩs second-in-command, in Baghdad alongside many others. The attack came while General Solemani was paying an official visit to the Iraqi capital.  тАЬIf an agreement on the expulsion of US forces from Iraq is not concluded in Washington, we reserve the right to target AmericaтАЩs interests in Iraq,"" the statement warned.  https://www.farsnews.ir/en/news/13990827000193/Irai-Leader-Pplar-Frces-Ready-Give-Crshing-Respnse-Any-Threa-by  --------  Saudi Arabia rejects, condemns Israel's settlement moves near East Jerusalem  Tuqa Khalid  17 November 2020  Saudi Arabia rejects and condemns Israel's move decision to invite contractor bids to build 1,257 new settlements near East Jerusalem, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday.  ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms the Kingdom's condemnation and rejection of the move, which contravenes international resolutions, undermines efforts towards the two-state solutions and affects efforts to achieve peace in the region,"" the ministry said in a tweet.  Israel moved ahead on Sunday with a settler housing plan in a sensitive area near East Jerusalem, a step critics said aimed to shore up the project before US President-elect Joe Biden takes office.  On its website, the Israel Land Authority (ILA) invited contractor bids for building 1,257 homes in Givat Hamatos, under a plan revived in February by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after it had been effectively frozen by international opposition.  Bidding ends on Jan. 18, the ILA said, two days before Biden is to be sworn in to replace President Donald Trump, whose administration has been supportive of Israeli settlement on occupied land Palestinians seek for a state.  Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said in a statement that settlements were illegal under international law and the tender was part of Israeli efforts ""to kill the internationally-backed two-state solution"".  Opponents of the project say it would sever parts of East Jerusalem from the nearby Palestinian town of Bethlehem in the West Bank, an issue European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell raised, saying he was ""deeply worried"" by the tender.  ""This is a key location between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Any settlement construction will cause serious damage to the prospects for a viable and contiguous Palestinian State,"" Borrell said in a statement.  The ILA gave no date for the start of construction.  Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group, accused Netanyahu's government of ""taking advantage of the final weeks of the Trump administration in order to set facts on the ground"" at Givat Hamatos.  Israel cites historical, political and biblical links to the West Bank and over 440,000 Israeli settlers live there, among three million Palestinians.  https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2020/11/17/Saudi-Arabia-rejects-condemns-Israel-s-settlement-moves-near-East-Jerusalem  --------   Mideast   Netanyahu had тАШwarmтАЩ talk with US President-elect Biden: IsraelтАЩs PM office  Tuqa Khalid  17 November 2020  IsraelтАЩs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a тАЬwarm conversationтАЭ with US President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, the PMтАЩs office said.  тАЬPrime Minister Netanyahu spoke this evening with US President-elect Joe Biden. In a warm conversation, the President-elect reiterated his deep commitment to the State of Israel and its security,тАЭ the PMтАЩs office said.

Netanyahu had congratulated Biden and running mate Kamala Harris on Twitter on November 8, a day after the Democrat declared victory in the US ballot.  However, in that message and subsequent public remarks, Netanyahu had refrained from referring to Biden as ""president-elect"", in what was widely seen as Israel as an attempt to avoid angering Trump, who has challenged his rival's victory.  But the statement issued after Netanyahu and Biden spoke used that term and said they had ""a warm conversation.""  https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/11/17/Netanyahu-had-warm-talk-with-US-President-elect-Biden-Israel-s-PM-office  --------  Iranian, Iraqi Air Forces Stress Cooperation in War on Terrorism  2020-November-17  During the meeting, General Nasirzadeh and General Jahid discussed grounds to further reinvigorate mutual cooperation and regional synergy between the two countries.  They also underscored the existence of grounds for cooperation in joint operations, overhauling and maintenance of different aircraft and training human resources.  Cooperation and operational synergy in fighting the Takfiri terrorists and other forces which threaten Iran and IraqтАЩs sustainable security were among other issues reviewed by the two commanders.  In a relevant development on Saturday, Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a meeting with his Iraqi counterpart General Juma Anad Saadoun in Tehran underlined his countryтАЩs preparedness to supply the Armed Forces in Iraq with needed weapons and military equipment.  тАЬThanks to its abundant capacities and infrastructures which are the fruits of the cruel sanctions era after the victory of the Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Republic of IranтАЩs defense ministry is ready to provide the Iraqi Armed ForcesтАЩ needs to strengthen IraqтАЩs defense power,тАЭ General Hatami said in the meeting.  Earlier this month, Iranian Army Airborne Commander General Yousef Qorbani announced that the Iraqi Army has demanded Iran to sell and mount its indigenous night vision systems on the Arab countryтАЩs helicopters.  тАЬThe Iraqi airborne officials visited Iran recently and we also decided to pay a reciprocal visit and the Iraqi side was highly interested in purchasing (helicopter) parts from Iran and wanted the Iran-made night vision systems to be mounted on their helicopters,тАЭ General Qorbani said.

""Supreme Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei had stressed that the occupied part of Azerbaijan should be given back to that country,"" he said.  In relevant remarks on Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said that establishment of peace in the Karabakh region will be to the benefit of all the regional nations, but meantime underlined that his nation stands firm against the deployment of any Takfiri terrorists near its borders.  ""There have been numerous reports on the presence of Takfiris, but we constantly hear from (official Azeri) sources that these reports are not accurate,"" he noted, adding that Tehran would not tolerate presence of militants across its borders.  ""The Islamic Republic of Iran has played and will continue to play a strategic role in all equations in the region,тАЭ the spokesman stated, and added, тАЬThe only permanent solution to this crisis is to consider the sovereignty of countries and respect borders.""  Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but it has been held by ethnic Armenian separatists backed by Armenia since 1992, when they broke from Azerbaijan in a war that killed some 30,000 people.  The conflict re-erupted in late September, becoming the worst fighting in the region in decades.  After weeks of fighting in and around Karabakh, the separatist junta government of the region finally acknowledged last week that it had lost control of the mountain enclaveтАЩs second-largest city of Shusha and that Azerbaijani forces were closing in on the main city of Khankendi, which Armenians call Stepanakert after a Bolshevik militant in the early 20th century.  Armenia and Azerbaijan eventually agreed to end hostilities earlier this week, under the deal that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Karabakh and seven surrounding districts.  In the meantime, Russia has deployed a peacekeeping contingent to Nagorno-Karabakh, to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire deal.  Moscow announced on Sunday that two Antonov An-124 Ruslan military transport aircraft carrying Russian peacekeepers and equipment had arrived in Yerevan.  тАЬThe aircraft delivered 10 BTR-82A armored personnel carriers, logistics equipment, as well as about 30 military personnel from peacekeeping units,тАЭ the military announced in a statement.  President Vladimir Putin on Saturday called on Azerbaijan to protect Christian shrines in the lands that are being given back to Baku.  Putin тАЬunderscored the importance of securing safety and normal church life of these shrinesтАЭ in a phone call with his Azeri counterpart Ilham Aliyev on Saturday, according to the Kremlin.  Aliyev noted that was how Azerbaijan, the Muslim nation, will act, according to the Kremlin.  Azerbaijan says almost all mosques and other Azerbaijani landmarks have been destroyed by Armenian forces during about 28 years of occupation.  https://www.farsnews.ir/en/news/13990827000633/Leader's-Aide-Warns-agains-Presence-f-Takfiri-Terrriss-in-Azerbaijan  --------  Israel says air strikes in Syria hit Syrian, Iranian military targets  18 November 2020  Israel launched air strikes against Syrian and Iranian targets in southern Syria on Wednesday after explosive devices were planted in the Israeli-held Golan Heights, the Israeli military said.

Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz, on a visit to the northern border on Tuesday, said Israel would not tolerate the planting of explosives in the Golan, territory captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.  тАЬWe cannot turn a blind eye to this. ItтАЩs a grave incident,тАЭ Gantz told reporters.  Israel has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets in Syria and those of allied militias, including LebanonтАЩs Hezbollah. Gantz said Israel held Syria responsible for тАЬeverything that occurs on [Syrian] territory.тАЭ  President Bashar al-AssadтАЩs government has never publicly acknowledged that there are Iranian forces operating on his behalf in SyriaтАЩs civil war.

In a show of hands, legislators voted in favor of a one-year mandate allowing the government to send troops to Azerbaijan, where they would observe possible violations of the truce from a joint Turkish-Russian monitoring center. The cease-fire ended six weeks of intense fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.  ErdoganтАЩs government would determine the number of troops to be sent and it wasn't immediately clear how many the country planned to deploy. The motion states that civilian personnel could also be deployed as part of the peacekeeping mission.  Last week, the defense ministers of Russia and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint monitoring center in Azerbaijan, although technical details of the mission are still being worked out.  Azerbaijan has been pressing for its ally Turkey, which has backed in in the conflict, to take an active role in the peace talks and was the first to announce its involvement in the monitoring of the cease-fire agreement.  Russian officials have said that AnkaraтАЩs involvement will be limited to the work of the monitoring center on Azerbaijani soil, and Turkish peacekeepers wouldn't go to Nagorno-Karabakh. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the center will operate remotely, using drones and other technical means to monitor possible violations.  Russia, which negotiated the cease-fire, is sending about 2,000 peacekeeping troops under a five-year mandate.  Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994.  https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/11/17/Turkey-s-parliament-grants-Erdogan-permission-to-deploy-peacekeepers-to-Azerbaijan  --------  Israel finds explosive devices in Golan, blames Syria for тАШviolating sovereigntyтАЩ  Emily Judd  17 November 2020  Israel blamed the Syrian regime on Tuesday for violating its тАШsovereigntyтАЩ in the Golan Heights after finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on the Israeli side of the countryтАЩs border with Syria.

In response, our aircraft struck military targets in southern Syria belonging to the Syrian Armed Forces,"" the IDF said in a post on Twitter.  In August, the Israeli military targeted a militant group placing explosives along the border fence with Syria on the Golan Heights.  Israel seized the territory of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and officially annexed the land in 1981.

Seeking to uphold the ideals of democracy, sustainable equity policies, and ultimately advancing Malay politics through progressive ideas, these mostly professional Umno members have formed the group calling itself тАШтАЩProgresif Umno"".  Speaking to Malay Mail, one of the movementтАЩs founding members, Muhammad Shaqib Shahrilnizam, said the creation of the caucus was meant to provide a voice for what he deemed as тАЬthe silent majorityтАЭ within the party who lack an avenue to express their ideas or concerns.  тАЬThe idea of the caucus is to bring a new narrative that is more friendly towards the people. We need to find a new narrative so that people would appreciate Umno and they feel Umno is one of the places where they can express their ideas, concerns, and even a place where they can fight for,тАЭ said the Pulai Umno Youth information chief.  тАЬAt the moment, Umno is perceived to be so conservative, an Islamist party, a party that propagates propaganda, this is what is clouding the party now but Umno is not like that.  тАЬThere are a lot of professionals within the party but they feel there is a lack of a caucus or a platform for them to be empowered. By establishing a caucus, it is like a beacon for all these silent progressives within the party to come together,тАЩтАЩ the 24-year-old said.  So who are the тАШprogressivesтАЩ in Umno?  The group said that members of the progressive caucus include those from the Barisan Nasional Youth Volunteers group, overseas Umno supporters clubs, and local university students.  тАЬThese people believe in the progressive value of Umno. So we are not a small group,тАЭ Shaqib said.  Another founding member, Ariff Zaky Zolkafly, who is also a committee member of Sg Siput Umno Youth, said the party has yet to possess a new тАЬrecipeтАЭ in accepting progressive members within their ranks.  He recalled that Umno during its early years comprised many teachers, working professionals and pertinent members of their respective communities.  тАЬIn the past, it's true that Umno used to consist of teachers, who were deemed as professionals as many of them had graduated with diploma and degrees and what's more is that they understand the problems at their respective locality.  тАЬAs time progress, we see engineers, doctors and other professionals joining the party, that in itself is progressive. But looking at the dynamic of politics right now, Umno have to accept these people but we have to find a new recipe to accept them being progressive within the party,тАЩтАЩ he said.  Making Malay politics progressive  So what exactly counts as тАЬprogressiveтАЭ ideas espoused by the caucus, considering the party by the virtue of its constitution will continue to be an ethnocentric one?  The group said these include ideas and policies that are directed towards advancing Malay politics, while at the same time pushing for equity and moving away from racial politics тАФ the last particularly associated with Umno, an exclusively Malay nationalist party.  тАЬWe need to go back to our roots. The true fundamentals of Umno. UmnoтАЩs ways of politics that focus on the peopleтАЩs wellbeing, not emphasising on hate speeches, or struggling for power.  тАЬWe do this for the people, not asking for people to listen to Umno, but that Umno should listen to people, change the voice and demand of the people, into a better collective policy-driven approach,тАЭ Shaqib said.  Both Shaqib and Ariff also claimed that progressive ideas are hardly new in the party, citing the names of its four influential pioneers: Datuk Onn Jaafar, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra al-Haj, Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, and Tun Dr Ismail Abdul Rahman.  Onn was the founder and first president of Umno; Tunku Abdul Rahman was the countryтАЩs first prime minister and Abdul Razak his immediate successor; while Dr Ismail was the latterтАЩs deputy.  тАЬProgressive ideas are not new, nor unappealing within Umno. From Tunku's brotherhood spirit, the policy framework brought by both Tun Dr Ismail and Tun Abdul Razak, the value of Datuk Onn's unification. ThereтАЩs a deep progressive tradition in Umno,тАЩтАЩ said Shaqib.  тАЬProgressive means the way we carry this party forward, strongly with the idea of UmnoтАЩstrue principle and ideologies.  тАЬWe are pro-welfare, we want to advance Malay politics, we emphasise on equitable distribution of wealth, without leaving anyone behind. It wonтАЩt be a stumbling block, progressive is a caucus, not just a rebellious group,тАЩтАЩ said Shaqib.  Reforming Umno from the inside  Since its inception, Umno has identified itself as a centre-right party, with an emphasis on nationalism, communal politics, and pro-Malay-Muslim policies.  However following the historic 2018 general elections which saw them fall from power for the first time in six decades, political observers have cautioned of the rise of more right-wing politics as Umno and their once political enemy PAS, banded together.  Political experts have stated the cooperation of the two parties dubbed as Muafakat Nasional has adopted a populist stance reinforced by communal and religious politics, a move to appeal to some within the Malay community.  While attracting like-minded progressive to Umno may prove to be challenging on itself, Ariff said the faction itself needs to be active in participating within their own respective party branches and divisions.  тАЬWe want them to learn the partyтАЩs system and along the way, we will support them and teach them on how to position themselves within the party,тАЭ he told Malay Mail.  тАЬSome were reluctant to voice their concerns before but now through this movement, we can help them and from work towards changing Umno from within.тАЭ  Ariff also stressed that the progressive caucus is not a platform for any popular figures within the party, saying they are only intending for genuine work towards change within the party for the good of all.  тАЬWe are working independently as we do not want to be labelled as anyoneтАЩs platform but rather a genuine means of getting likeminded people together and working towards a goal,тАЩтАЩ he said.  https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/11/18/were-not-rebels-young-leaders-form-progressive-caucus-to-push-for-reforms-i/1923624  --------  Parliament to discuss issues on undocumented migrants, religious sentiments today  18 Nov 2020  KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 18 тАФ Efforts by the government in managing illegal immigrants and enforcement of laws pertaining to religious sentiments are among matters to be discussed at the Dewan Rakyat sitting today.

The UNHCR said on Tuesday that an average of 4,000 women, men, and children had crossed the border into eastern Sudan every day since November 10.  UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch also told a briefing in the Swiss city of Geneva that in total, over 27,000 people had traveled into Sudan at three border locations over the past few days.  тАЬUNHCR is warning that a full-scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding as thousands of refugees flee ongoing fighting in EthiopiaтАЩs Tigray region each day to seek safety in eastern Sudan,тАЭ Baloch said.  тАЬPeople are coming out of Ethiopia really scared, afraid, with stories saying they have been fleeing heavy fighting and thereтАЩs no sign of the fighting stopping,тАЭ he said.  Sudan, one of the worldтАЩs poorest countries, is now faced with the massive influx. UN agencies were mobilizing resources and trying to assist the refugees, who have been arriving in growing numbers with few possessions or provisions.  Jens Laerke, another spokesman of the OCHA said, тАЬThere may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible.тАЭ  The Ethiopian government has been fighting local rebels in Tigray since late last month.  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said earlier on Tuesday that a three-day deadline given to the rebels in Tigray to lay down their arms had ended, warning of a final push to retake the regional capital, Mekelle.  The fighting has left hundreds dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee across the border into Sudan. The crisis also risks destabilizing the wider Horn of Africa region.  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/17/638805/Full-scale-humanitarian-crisis-unfolding-in-Ethiopia-UNHCR  --------  Ethiopian PM declares deadline given to rebels in north over  17 November 2020  Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says the three-day deadline given to rebel forces in the northern region of Tigray to lay down their arms has ended, warning of a final push to retake the regional capital, Mekelle.  ""The three-day ultimatum given to Tigray Special Forces and the militia to surrender to the national defense... ended today,"" Abiy said in a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday. ""Following the expiration of this deadline, the final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days.""  Abiy gave Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), three days to surrender to the national army on Friday. He said they were ""in the final throes of death.""  The prime minister announced a military offensive in Tigray on November 4, saying it was in response to assaults by the TPLF on federal troops.  The fighting has left hundreds dead and forced around 25,000 Ethiopians to flee across the border into Sudan. The crisis also risks destabilizing the wider Horn of Africa region.  The warning came after government forces conducted ""precision-led and surgical air operations"" outside Makelle, according to a government emergency task-force, and after ground troops pushed forward, reportedly on Monday morning.  Tigrayan leaders accused the government of having attacked a sugar factory and a dam.  Abiy, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has resisted calls by the United Nations, the African Union, and various countries for talks with the armed rebels in the north.  The fighting is now set to continue as Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael said on Tuesday that ""the government and people of Tigray"" would hold their ground.  ""This campaign cannot be finished. As long as the army of the invaders is in our land, the fight will continue. They cannot keep us silent by military force,"" he told AFP.  Nobel Committee calls for end to fighting  The Nobel Committee, which awarded Abiy the 2019 Peace Prize for his efforts to heal divisions with Eritrea, expressed its deep concern about the fighting in Ethiopia and urged all parties to de-escalate.  ""The Committee is following developments in Ethiopia closely and is deeply concerned,"" its Secretary Olav Njolstad told AFP on Monday.  ""It reiterates today what it said before, namely that all parties involved share responsibility for halting the escalation of violence and contributing to resolving differences and conflicts by peaceful means.""  https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/11/17/638769/Ethiopian-PM-declares-deadline-given-to-rebels-in-north-over  --------  URL: https://www.newageislam.com/islamic-world-news/new-age-islam-news-bureau/tired-of-cattiest-cpm-dalit-woman-chithralekha-in-kerala-to-seek-solace-in-islam/d/123504  New Age Islam, Islam Online, Islamic Website, African Muslim News, Arab World News, South Asia News, Indian Muslim News, World Muslim News, Women in Islam, Islamic Feminism, Arab Women, Women In Arab, Islamophobia in America, Muslim Women in West, Islam Women and Feminism Sultan Shahin, E-22, Indra Prastha Apts., 114, I.

Will a sizeable section of the community continue to vote for the National Democratic Alliance or NDA as they did in 2019? Or will the vote get fragmented among the four major players: the NDA, the Lok Janshakti Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party-led alliance, and the opposition Mahagathbandhan? According to the latest Lokniti-CSDS survey, the anti-incumbency sentiment within the social coalition of the NDA is strongest among the Dalits. The upper castes favour the return of Nitish Kumar by a 53 per cent to 32 per cent margin and the non-Yadav OBCs by 56 per cent to 28 per cent. The potential deserter that can unravel this NDA coalition are the Dalits who favour the removal of the Nitish Kumar government by 48 per cent to the 34 per cent who do not. The exact same thing happened in 2015, when the Dalits dumped the BJP and its allies. The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) won just three out of the 60 seats allotted to them, and thus dragged down the NDAтАЩs final tally. Why do Dalit voters in Bihar remain elusive to political players? And what explains the remarkable stability in Dalit voting patterns in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh? In socio-economic profile as well as cultural influences, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are close cousins. There isnтАЩt a yawning difference between the Dalit populations of the two states: 21 per cent in Uttar Pradesh and 16 per cent in Bihar. The indicators of socio-economic depredation of Dalits are also much the same. This is particularly true of eastern UP and Bihar, both characterised by semi-feudal land relations and persistent underdevelopment. Yet, while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was a strong force in eastern UP, it is virtually absent in Bihar. In a broad sense, the Dalit energy in UP was cultivated by the BSP in the politics of Ambedkarism and the idiom of everyday assertion, whereas in Bihar, it grew in the politics of Marxism and the idiom of class war. As Marxism atrophied under its own contradictions, the political consciousness of Dalits got subsumed within the mainstream politics of Bihar. Also read: UP DalitsтАЩ attitude to bloc voting different from Tamil Nadu. Research tells us why Why did the lower-caste political assertion in Uttar Pradesh split into two streams тАФ OBC politics, which eventually coalesced around the Samajwadi Party, and Dalit politics, around the BSP тАФ while being monopolised by OBCs in Bihar? We suggest a historical path dependence in the nature of political mobilisation of Dalits in UP and Bihar.  First, Bihar lacked the political leadership that could foment a distinct Dalit political consciousness. As Badri Narayan has noted, the Kanshi Ram-led BSP didnтАЩt simply focus on electoral competition, but laid a strong emphasis on the construction of a Dalit identity and adopted a confrontationist stance against the upper castes. In contrast, the Dalit parties of Bihar like the LJP and HAM, have mainly concerned themselves with getting a good deal from mainstream parties and thus, Ambedkarite consciousness remained weaker in Bihar. Jagjivan Ram, in some ways, set the template in the stateтАЩs politics тАФ modest reform and staying clear of any radical politics тАФ and this was imbibed by the next generation of Dalit leaders. Perhaps for these reasons, Jagjivan Ram is said to be the central object of ridicule in Kanshi RamтАЩs famous book The Chamcha Age. Without having formed a distinct ideology, the Dalit leaders of Bihar тАФ Ram Vilas Paswan, Shyam Rajak and Jitan Ram Manjhi тАФ only command the following of their own Dalit sub-castes. In fact, Paswan publicly disapproved of the anti-upper caste rhetoric of the BSP and had a chilly relationship with both Kanshi Ram and Mayawati. Second, Uttar Pradesh had a numerically strong and upwardly mobile Dalit caste тАФ the Jatavs тАФ around which Kanshi Ram initially built the BAMCEF (All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation), and later the BSP. Formed by central government employees, the BAMCEF catered to upwardly mobile and office-seeking SC elite who encountered a representational blockage within the Congress party. Jatavs form approximately 56 per cent of the Dalit population in UP, and along with a fraction of Muslims and backward castes, provided the BSP a resilient vote share above 20 per cent in the four-cornered polity of Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, the Dalits of Bihar are more fragmented in sub-castes. Both Jatavs and Dusadhs (Paswans) account for nearly one-third each of the stateтАЩs Dalit population, and then there are numerous others. In the post-1990s era, Ram Vilas Paswan was the most likely candidate to build a Dalit party in Bihar, but he was both unwilling and unable to do so. For one, Paswan was more inclined to play a central role in national politics, functioning inside mainstream parties, than devoting himself to create a distinct platform for Dalits. PaswanтАЩs popular reputation of divining electoral winds and shifting allegiances (the notorious тАЬmausam vigyanikтАЭ tag) also held little validity in terms of state politics, where he repeatedly ended up on the side of the losing coalition. Instead, he adopted a conciliatory line and courted upper castes, especially Bhumihars. This strategy was partly driven by the fact that the other Dalit castes were indifferent to Paswan. Indeed, while the BSP regularly won two-thirds of the Jatav vote since the 1990s, Paswan never managed to command more than 50 per cent of his Dusadh vote base. Third, the mobilisation energy of Dalits was appropriated both by backward caste and Left parties in Bihar. In a 2004 National Election Survey, over 50 per cent of Dalits saw Lalu Prasad Yadav as a тАЬmessiah of the poorтАЭ. YadavтАЩs platform of dignity for the downtrodden and rhetorical attacks on upper-caste landlords made Dalits a key vote-bank of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) through the тАЩ90s. Mulayam Singh Yadav in UP was perhaps more seen as a leader of the upwardly mobile Yadavs than of the poor or Bahujans, which led to antagonism between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and BSP by the mid-90s. Similarly, Nitish Kumar mobilised the Mahadalits (mostly everyone excluding the Dusadhs) with concrete promises of social welfare and protection. Therefore, as political scientist Amit Ahuja has written, while Dalits in UP saw Mayawati as their leader, they saw Lalu Yadav and later Nitish Kumar as their leader in Bihar. Also read: Who are the Paswans? тАШUpwardly mobile, powerfulтАЩ Dalit group at centre of Bihar polls buzz The Left parties mobilised the Dalits of central Bihar during the 1980s in violent confrontations with upper-caste landlords, promising security and an end to exploitation. The Indian PeopleтАЩs front, the political wing of the CPI(ML), mostly backed by Dalit labourers of central Bihar, was carried to seven seats in the 1990 election with a voteshare marginally above 10 per cent in the seats contested. This was a much better performance compared to the BSP of the time in Uttar Pradesh. However, Dalit support for the Left had imploded by the early 2000s. This happened because the Left parties in Bihar fell between two stools: as middle castes grew stronger in terms of land ownership in the countryside, it lost much of its backward-caste support on the land question. And it failed to adopt a more representative character on the Dalit question since the leadership role in these parties continued to be held by upper castes and dominant backward castes. Furthermore, it got stuck on the land-reform question even as other parties such as the Janata Dal (United) and the RJD mobilised Dalits on development and government benefits, much like the BSP had done in Uttar Pradesh. Dalit politics in Bihar is undergoing an unprecedented churning and how they choose to vote may not only decide who forms the next government in the state, but can also herald the fourth major shift of Dalit voters in Bihar тАФ the first being the shift from the Congress to the Left and OBC parties, the second being the consolidation of the Dalit vote for the RJD, and the third being the shift to pre-2020 NDA constituents тАФ the BJP, LJP and JD(U).

The National Council of Churches in India (NCCI) and the Catholic BishopsтАЩ Conference of India (CBCI) urged the entire Christian community to renew their responsibility toward sisters and brothers of Dalit origin, especially the women, who suffer the most. NCCI is the apex body and ecumenical expression of Protestant and Orthodox Churches as well as ecumenical organizations, regional councils and agencies in India. CBCIтАЩs Office for Scheduled Castes/Backward Classes is the official body formed for the overall development of the Dalits, Tribals and Backward Classes. CBCIтАЩs Office Chairman, Reverend Sarat Chandra Nayak said in his message that тАЬThis land, where female deities are worshiped as power, knowledge and wealth, has become the most unsafe place for women. Facts show that Dalit women suffer the horrors more than Dalit men.тАЭ тАЬIn recent months, many Dalit women have been targeted, attacked and brutally killed. We bewail the fact that justice often eludes the Dalit survivors, while the perpetrators, backed by their political patrons, manipulate the law and move around scot-free.тАЭ тАЬViolence against Dalits is often based on caste prejudice. The perpetrators consider Dalit women as mere objects to be used and thrown away. At the core, unless such a discriminatory and dehumanizing mentality changes, there won't be a reduction in the crimes against the marginalized. ThatтАЩs possible only when every family consciously and practically promotes at home the equal dignity and right of every child,тАЭ the Christian leader added. тАЬLamentably, the intellectual luminaries, human rights activists, civil society members and the unprejudiced media are strategically silenced, while others become the mouthpiece of the power of the day and slaves of the privileged class,тАЭ he said. According to The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, no person who professes a religion different from the Hindu (the Sikh or the Buddhist) religion shall be deemed to be a member of a Scheduled Caste. For several years, Dalit Christians and Muslims in the country have been pressing on the government seeking for the scheduled castes status, but have seen no hope. Throughout India, Dalits are considered as the lowest caste of all people. Irrespective of the religion, they are highly vulnerable to social discrimination, especially the women. According to government data, there are more than 200 million Dalits in India. Of the 25 million Christians in the country, 60 percent are of Dalit/tribal origin. тАЬNo one can serve Christ and caste тАФ the practice of caste is a sin and untouchability a crime. Practice of caste in its many manifestations despite it being rendered illegal is a blot on Indian social life and polity. Unfortunately social institutions including churches and political parties practice caste either tacitly or sometimes even openly,тАЭ NCCI said in its November 8 press release.
