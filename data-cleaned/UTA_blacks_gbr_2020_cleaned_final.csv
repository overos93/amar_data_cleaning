(WAFB) - On Tuesday, Jan. 28, Governor John Bel Edwards announced changes to Louisiana State Police‚Äôs (LSP) Protective Services unit. Captain Treone Larvadain has been promoted to lead the unit, making her the first African American female captain in LSP history. She succeeds Captain Clay Chutz, who recently retired after 30 years of service with LSP under six different governors (Buddy Roemer, Edwin Edwards, Mike Foster, Kathleen Blanco, Bobby Jindal, and John Bel Edwards). I am happy to announce Captain Treone Larvadain has been promoted to lead the @LAStatePolice Protective Services division, becoming the first African-American female captain in State Police history. #lagov #lalege üì∞: https://t.co/6SvYeF93ar ‚ÄúI am extremely proud of both Captain Larvadain and Captain Chutz and congratulate them on their accomplishments. They have both provided excellent service to the people of our state and exemplify the best of the Louisiana State Police. My family and I are especially grateful for the professional work Captain Chutz has provided to us over the last four years and have the utmost confidence in Captain Larvadain, who has worked alongside him and has now taken over the reins. The longevity of Captain Chutz‚Äôs career and the promotion of Captain Larvadain are a direct reflection of their dedication and commitment to the force and our great state,‚Äù said Gov. Edwards. RELATED: History in the Making: La. State Police‚Äôs first mother, daughter troopers A representative with the governor‚Äôs office says Larvadain was hired in March of 2006 and began her career with Troop C. She worked in Protective Services from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, she was promoted to sergeant in the Bureau of Investigations and also served as an instructor at the training academy. Then in 2018, Larvadain was promoted to lieutenant in Internal Affairs. Also in 2018, Treone and her daughter Tiah became the first-ever mother and daughter to serve in the Louisiana State Police. According to LSP‚Äôs website, the Protective Services unit is ‚Äúa unique section that allocates manpower based on the needs of the current Governor.‚Äù ‚ÄúProtective Services is responsible for the safety and security of the Governor and the Governor‚Äôs immediate family. Additionally, Protective Services provides security details to the Lieutenant Governor and other dignitaries at the Governor‚Äôs request. Protective Services also assists in protecting the President of the United States when requested by the Secret Service and further provides protection and logistics for visiting Governors and leaders from other states and countries. Louisiana State Police troopers and Department of Public Safety officers are assigned to the Governor‚Äôs Mansion 24 hours a day, year-round and are responsible for the physical protection of the Mansion and its grounds. Protective Services also has a detail assigned to the Louisiana State Capitol overseeing the day-to-day physical security operations at the Governor‚Äôs office in the Capitol.‚Äù Copyright 2020 WAFB.

It marks the first time a flattop has paid homage to an African American, a Navy Cross recipient and an enlisted service member. And it was decreed on a day set aside to remember the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his lifelong crusade to end racial discrimination across the United States. With the USS Arizona Memorial his backdrop, Modly sketched how Miller rose to battle on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, a mess attendant in a racially segregated rating that made African American men servants to white officers. Instead of collecting the morning‚Äôs laundry, Miller carried wounded shipmates from the blazing battleship West Virginia after it was hit by enemy fire. He fought the flames as they erupted on the vessel and then manned a .50 caliber machine gun ‚Äî a weapon he never operated previously ‚Äî to swat away Japanese planes during the ongoing surprise attack that launched the United States into World War II. His ammo spent and ordered to abandon ship, he was one of the last three sailors to escape the West Virginia. Advanced to mess attendant first class on June 1, 1942, and awarded the Navy Cross for combat valor, Miller was killed 17 months later when a Japanese submarine sank the escort carrier Liscome Bay off Makin Atoll during the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. ‚ÄúHe died as he lived, an American sailor defending his nation, shoulder to shoulder with his shipmates, until the end,"" said Modly. ""Dorie Miller stood for everything that is good about our nation. His story deserves to be remembered and repeated wherever our people continue to stand the watch today. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not just the story of one sailor. It is the story of our Navy, of our nation and our ongoing struggle to form ‚Äî in the words of our Constitution ‚Äî a more perfect union.‚Äù The future aircraft carrier Miller won‚Äôt be the first Navy vessel to honor the hero. On June 20, 1973, the Navy commissioned the destroyer escort Miller ‚Äî which was reclassified as a frigate two years later. Modly said that when completed, the new Doris Miller, a Gerald R. Ford-class carrier, will be the most powerful and lethal warship ever built by man. Designed to operate deep into the 21st century, more than 100,000 officers and crew will serve on the carrier, many of them yet to be born. The bulk of those sailors and Marines will be enlisted, the men and women Modly called ‚Äúthe steel spine of our ships.‚Äù He said the faces of a great and diverse crew will go with their carrier to every corner of the globe as a visible symbol of American values. The name of the carrier also will remind the nation of its everlasting debt to the veterans of World War II who, like Miller, sacrificed so that future American generations would be free. The acting secretary traced a similar journey Miller‚Äôs legacy took in the mid-20th century, from his day of courage in Pearl Harbor to a budding civil rights movement that leaned on him as an example to force a wartime nation to open up its defense plants to African Americans. Modly pointed to the bitter irony of African American service members who fought tyranny abroad in World War II only to return home to a nation that denied them liberty simply because of the color of their skin. He drew a moral arc from Miller‚Äôs heroism and quietly persuasive call for positive change during the war to the core message of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail: ‚ÄúInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.‚Äù That same line continued to Aug. 28, 1963, on the National Mall, when King stood before the Lincoln Memorial and uttered his ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech to thousands of peaceful protesters during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. And then it all returned to Pearl Harbor, where Modly officially named a new carrier in Miller‚Äôs honor, only a short distance from where he became one of the first Americans to fight in World War II. ‚ÄúIn selecting this name, we honor the contributions of all our enlisted ranks, past and present, men and women, of every race, religion and background,‚Äù said Modly. ‚ÄúDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. observed, ‚ÄòEverybody can be great - because anybody can serve.' No one understands the importance and true meaning of service than those who have volunteered to put the needs of others above themselves.‚Äù That spirit was bipartisan. U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, a Republican who represents Miller‚Äôs hometown of Waco, pointed to the importance of a carrier named after an enlisted hero, saying that it will serve as inspiration to future generations of young service members. Also born in segregated Waco but today representing Dallas, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson recalled hearing the tale of Miller‚Äôs heroism from her father. She continues to spearhead the push on Capitol Hill and inside the Pentagon to upgrade Miller‚Äôs Navy Cross to the Medal of Honor. ‚ÄúMy journey‚Äôs not quite over,"" she said. Prine came to Navy Times after stints at the San Diego Union-Tribune and Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He served in the Marine Corps and the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. His awards include the Joseph Galloway Award for Distinguished Reporting on the military, a first prize from Investigative Reporters & Editors and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

By Raymond Joseph National Lotteries Commission COO Phillemon Letwaba signed off a multi-million rand Lottery grant to a non-profit organisation directed by his family member. Photo copied for fair use from NLC website According to leaked bank statements, R2 million was paid to Upbrand Properties by I Am Made For God‚Äôs Glory (IAM4GG), which received a R11,375,000 grant from the Lottery to develop an ‚Äúintegrated sports facility‚Äù in Limpopo. The sole director of Upbrand is Kenneth Tomoletso Sithole, first cousin of NLC chief operating officer Phillemon Letwaba. GroundUp has previously revealed how Upbrand received a R15-million contract to build a rehabilitation centre near Pretoria at a time when Letwaba‚Äôs brother, Johannes ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù Letwaba, was a director of the company. Johannes Letwaba subsequently resigned, leaving Keneilwe Constance Maboa, the wife of Karabo Sithole, another first cousin of the Letwaba brothers, as the company‚Äôs sole director. When Maboa resigned 17 months later, Kenneth Sithole was appointed as Upbrand‚Äôs sole director. The bank statements are for an IAM4GG account opened at Nedbank on 10 January 2017. The account lay dormant for over a year until an amount of R380 was transferred into it to reactivate it on 16 February 2018. Once again there was no activity on the account and by 25 April 2018 bank charges had reduced the available credit to just R190.55. The next day the NLC paid R9.1-million into the account, the first of two tranches of the IAM4GG grant. The second tranche of R2,275,000 was paid into the account on 6 July 2018. The application for funding submitted to the NLC listed lawyer Lesley Ramulifho as IAM4GG‚Äôs chairperson and Karabo Sithole as secretary. In other words, money passed from the National Lotteries Commission, of which Letwaba is COO, through IAM4GG, of which Letwaba‚Äôs cousin Karabo Sithole is secretary, to Upbrand, of which Kenneth Sithole, cousin of both Karabo Sithole and of Letwaba, is sole director. And the chairman of IAM4GG is Ramulifho, who has already received at least R60 million in Lottery funds, as GroundUp has previously revealed. Moreover, Phillemon Letwaba signed the grant agreement for the NLC on 16 April 201 8. In its application for funding, IAM4GG said the plan was ‚Äúto provide infrastructure in order to advance sport, recreation and physical activity in communities across the country‚Äù. The project was aimed at sports ‚Äútransformation‚Äù and athletes from ‚Äúdisadvantaged ‚Ä¶ especially our rural communities‚Äù. It would create 60 full-time and 40 part-time jobs and benefit over 16,000 people, according to the application. GroundUp has not been able to establish where this ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù is located because the NLC failed to answer our questions. But the commission told GroundUp in a November 2018 statement that the ‚Äúproject work is complete‚Äù and the project had been handed over to the local municipality. The grant allocated R10,440,000 for ‚Äúcapacity building (integrated sports facility)‚Äù; R500,000 for ‚Äúsports equipment and apparel‚Äù and R435,000 for administration. But only five payments in the leaked IAM4GG bank statements appear to be directly connected to the sports facility: R500,000 on 7 May 2018, for ‚Äúconstruction sports stadium‚Äù and a further four payments for ‚Äúsports centre‚Äù that totalled R22,500. The payments were made on 17, 19 and 20 July 2018. If there were any further payments related to the sports facility, they are not recorded as such on the bank statements. There were two mystery payments from the IAM4GG account for R5 million on 4 May 2018, and a further R700,000 on 7 July, paid into an account identified only by a number. An amount of R3 million was paid into the same account on 26 January 2018 by Denzhe, an NPO controlled by Ramulifho. This number refers to a Nedbank ‚Äúinvestment account‚Äù, according to a source at the bank. However there are other deductions for management fees (R50,000 on 30 April 2018 and R25,000 on 7 May), and deductions to Hush Interiors, an upmarket decor company (R40,000 on 3 May 2018), Bradlows (R19,599.95 on 8 May 2018) and Vaja Products (saunas and steam rooms ‚Äì R132,000 on 8 May 2018). Within days of the first R9.1 million tranche of the Lottery grant landing in IAM4GG‚Äôs account, the first of a series of payments totalling R644,000 were made for ‚Äúlegal drafting‚Äù.The payments, ranging from R10,000 to R200,000, were made between 30 April and 30 May 2018. And, after the second tranche of R2,275,000 was paid on 6 July 2018, a further R373,900 was paid out for ‚Äúlegal drafting‚Äù over the next two weeks. The bank statements also list payments totalling R672,000 that are described as ‚Äúfranchise fee‚Äù from the NPO‚Äôs bank account. By 30 June 2018, the Lottery funding was almost exhausted with only R1,708.79 left in the account. But six days later, on 6 July, the account was topped up again with a deposit of R2,275,000 ‚Äî the second tranche ‚Äî by the NLC. However, after a series of payments ‚Äî including R373,900 for ‚Äúlegal drafting‚Äù, R700,000 into the mystery account, R100,000 for ‚Äúmanagement fees‚Äù and R50,000 to a courier company ‚Äî the account balance was reduced to just R81,706.99 by 14 July, a week after the NLC payment. Neither Ramulifho nor his employee Liesl Moses responded to emailed questions about the project and the information contained in the bank statements. GroundUp also contacted two people listed as directors of IAM4GG when the organisation was registered with the Department of Social Development in 2012: Thomas Nkuna, deputy chairperson, and Mpho Maphanga, treasurer. Neither responded. The NLC failed to respond to detailed questions sent to Commissioner Thabang Mampane and spokesman Ndivuhuho Mafela. Instead the NLC‚Äôs head of legal affairs, Tsietsi Maselwa, responded by email, noting the ‚Äúserious allegations‚Äù, and claiming to be unaware of most of the information on which we based our questions. Phillemon Letwaba is suing Raymond Joseph (the author of this article), Nathan Geffen (the editor of GroundUp), and Community Media Trust (the owner of GroundUp) for defamation.

He is for the African cause and reckons Africa shall regain its rightful place in world affairs soon. Although ‚ÄòPolicy‚Äô- a game of chance was operated through various states in the U.S., it was in Chicago‚Äôs South side where it was operated and run by African-Americans that Policy became a multi-million dollar enterprise. Its success of the 1930s, 40s and 50s eventually led the state to move in setting up the state lottery. In 1946, the Jones Brothers comprising Edward, George, and McKissack (Mack) were at the top of the $25 million-a-year policy syndicate in Chicago. Anger in Nigeria as president‚Äôs daughter uses presidential jet for private task ‚Äô52 Blocks‚Äô, the Afrocentric martial art technique that inspired Mike Tyson, Wesley Snipes, others Chicago‚Äôs black ‚ÄòPolicy Kings‚Äô who bankrolled stars and projects from their criminal activity Nigerian church accountant jailed 18 years for stealing church money Money derived from Chicago‚Äôs lottery or policy game also financed banks, insurance companies, restaurants, Provident Hospital, Negro baseball league teams and even a cemetery. ‚ÄúProvident Hospital now a public hospital was the first African-American owned and operated hospital in America. Provident was established in Chicago in 1891 by Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, an African-American surgeon during the time in American history where few public or private medical facilities were open to black Americans. It was founded to provide health care and medical training. Its initial officers were president John M. Brown, vice president Richard Mason Hancock, treasurer John T. Jenifer, secretary Louis H. Reynolds, and auditor Lloyd D. Wheeler. ‚ÄúIn 1893, the first documented heart surgery was performed by Dr. Daniel Williams at Provident Hospital and Training School.‚Äù Given that Policy Sam alias Samuel Young is remembered for bringing the illegal numbers game ‚ÄòPolicy‚Äô to Chicago in 1885, it lends credence to talk that the hospital was financed through proceeds from that endeavor. Policy came to an end with the launch of the Illinois State Lottery in 1974. With funds no longer coming through to run it, the historic Provident Hospital was forced to close in 1987 due to financial difficulties. When it reopened in 1993, it did so as a public hospital, part of the Cook County Hospital System to provide services to residents of Chicago‚Äôs South Side. It is now known as Provident Hospital of Cook County. ‚ÄúThe Illinois Health Facilities & Services Review Board approved Cook County Health‚Äôs application to build a new hospital to serve the needs of members of the community. The eight-story, $240 million facility for Provident Hospital in Bronzeville is expected to be ready by April 2023. The new hospital will offer MRI imaging, bariatrics, orthopedics, dental and sports medicine.‚Äù Although authorities plan to demolish the Provident Hospital structure once the one on a new site is up, it is hoped the beacon of hope which also served as the first nursing school for black women in Chicago will be in the hearts and minds of many Africans-Americans for its significant place in the Black advancement story.

Walters‚Äô wife, Patricia Turner Walters, gifted her collection to the school. ‚ÄúIt is an incredible honor to receive this generous gift of precious art from the Walters family,‚Äù said President Wayne A.

Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly will honour hero Doris Miller on Martin Luther King Day tomorrow, during a ceremony in Honolulu. Miller was born in Waco, Texas, and is widely regarded as a national hero as well as a civil rights hero because of the actions he took at Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941, when Japanese planes attacked the battleship West Virginia, where he was working as a mess attendant. At the time, African Americans were not allowed to man a gun in the Navy, but Miller took charge amid the chaos and took hold of an anti-aircraft machine gun, which he fired against enemy planes. When his ammunition ran out, Miller raced to assist the fatally wounded commanding officer and others before the West Virginia sank. His bravery earned him the Navy Cross, the second-highest military decoration, though many believe he deserved the top award, the Medal of Honor. Miller died nearly two years after Pearl Harbor while serving aboard the USS Liscome Bay. According to Navy records cited by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Miller will be the first African American to have an aircraft carrier named after him. As of December, 14 ships had been named for African Americans, including destroyers and a ballistic missile submarine. Doreen Ravenscroft, president of Cultural Arts of Waco and team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial, spoke about Miller‚Äôs accomplishments and the impact they had. She commented: I think that Doris Miller is an American hero simply because of what he represents as a young man going beyond the call of what‚Äôs expected. Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy. In the end, the fact that he didn‚Äôt think about what could be repercussions ‚Äî that wasn‚Äôt a thought when, at the time and in war, he did what was needed in his way to defend the United States of America. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Waco native who has been encouraging the Navy to posthumously award Miller the Medal of Honor, will speak at the ceremony. Two of Miller‚Äôs nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.

Fans in the Senegalese star's village of Bambali jumped up and down, waving shirts above their head after he beat Mohamed Salah and Riyad Mahrez to the prestigious award. It was the first time Mane, 27, has won the award - with Reds team-mate Salah winning the last two. Mahrez had won the award in 2016, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ended Yaya Toure's four-year winning streak in 2015. Mane is a hero in his home town after generously building schools and hospitals there over the years. And locals crowded around a big screen in the heart of the village, as they nervously waited for the announcement. Mane was the deserved winner of the award, having scored a staggering 31 goals in 52 games for the Reds in 2019. He was a key man as Jurgen Klopp's men lifted the Champions League trophy and then stormed to the top of the Premier League table, too.

"12",150,"https://www.blackenterprise.com/ceo-seeks-to-increase-african-american-homeownership-through-legacy/","CEO Seeks to Increase African American Homeownership Through LEGACY","Ben Slayton, president and CEO of LEGACY Home Loans, has recently opened two new branch offices located in predominantly black communities. Slayton‚Äôs company is based in Las Vegas and is considered to be one of the most successful black-owned mortgage banking firms with a focus on building homeownership due to its unwavering loyalty to black communities throughout America. Slayton has been a prominent community leader since he became the first African American realtor in America in 1964. The reason behind Slayton‚Äôs use of the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù lies in the fact that it has a special meaning to black Americans. Legacy is basically our desire to leave a large amount of wealth for our families. Homeownership is one of the main ways Americans gain wealth. However, African American homeownership is at an all-time low with only 41% of black Americans owning their own homes. According to Slayton, ‚ÄúIf we work together, we can increase that 41% to something close to where the White population is at 72%, which is over a 30% homeownership gap. We all need to do something about this, and one way is to start building sustainable wealth through homeownership and start leaving legacies for our families.‚Äù The new branch offices are located all over the country including Hyde Park in Illinois, a suburb that was Barack Obama‚Äôs hometown and downtown Atlanta which is the hometown of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. According to BlackNews.com, the Illinois location is managed by Leonard Pollard, a 25-year veteran of the mortgage business while the Georgia location is managed by Tony Bryant who is also a 25-year veteran of the mortgage business. What separates LEGACY Home Loans from other mortgage companies is that it uses the profits of the branches to not only open additional locations but to be able to hire people in predominantly black communities and donate to resources that serve the black community as a whole. According to BlackNews.com, Slayton‚Äôs vision for the future of LEGACY Home Loans is to make it a household name in the black American community ‚Äúwhen it comes to the purchase of a new home or a refinance of an existing home, by opening branch offices in every city in the United States that has 25% or more of African Americans in the population. And, by hiring local mortgage professionals in the black communities and giving them the tools, loan programs, and resources, they can compete head-to-head with any mortgage lender in the United States.‚Äù    !function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document;c=n.createElement('script'),c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document); cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: '54515f60-b777-49b5-9cdd-1ec71c3b2620' }).render('1b37e0aabe7e47acbf988f0bd583eba5'); });  EVENTSWomen of Power SummitEntrepreneurs SummitBlack Men XCELWomen of Power TECH PODCASTSSistersInc.Your Money, Your Life LATEST LISTSBE 100sB.E.

(WIS) - It‚Äôs a piece of Columbia history, left forgotten for the last fifty years. The Good Samaritan Waverly Hospital served Columbia‚Äôs African American community during the Jim Crow Era, a time when the color of your skin dictated what doctors you could visit. Today, Allen University breathed new life into the hospital, breaking ground on a renovation of the building to host the Institute on Civility, and the School of Education, along with other spaces. ‚ÄúIt signifies that progress is always possible,‚Äù Allen University President Ernest McNealey said. A former nurse at the hospital said when the shovels went into the ground today, she watched a dream 50 years in the making come true. The hospital, which sits now with windows missing and doors boarded up, restored to its former glory here in the Columbia community. ‚ÄúIt has always been my dream that we will have Waverly good Samaritan hospital as a vital part of the community because that‚Äôs what it was, a vital part of the community,‚Äù former Good Samaritan Waverly Hospital nurse Jean Sanders Hopkins said. Hopkins said she dreamed of becoming a nurse at Good Samaritan Waverly Hospital since she was 11 years old, and in 1959 that dream came true. ‚ÄúWe trusted our patients. We rubbed their backs, combed their hair, and we would help them do whatever they needed for wellness,‚Äù Hopkins said. Hopkins, along with the other nurses and doctors, gave critical care to African Americans during a time when many hospitals wouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWe wanted to give good care because we know that people needed good care. People of color needed good care. And that‚Äôs important because every patient was treated with respect and number one with love,‚Äù Hopkins said. The building housed state of the art facilities with a pharmacy, x-ray room, two operating rooms, and fifty beds. ‚ÄúAnd we had doctor Spann here who was awesome as a surgeon. And we had some wonderful medical doctors who practice here who could get you well in no time,‚Äù Hopkins said. Dr. Cyril Spann was the first African American surgeon in South Carolina. Hopkins said he inspired many who worked with him, including her. ‚ÄúEverything had to be perfect. The operating room. The instruments. Dr. Spann did not tolerate any laxity, that was not going to happen,‚Äù Hopkins said. Waverly closed it‚Äôs doors in 1973, struggling under mounting debt. ‚ÄúMany of the people who were cared for here didn‚Äôt have insurance, so they couldn‚Äôt pay for their hospital bill,‚Äù Hopkins said. The civil rights act and the integration of hospitals also served as a blow to Waverly‚Äôs finances, struggling to attract white patients. However, today‚Äôs groundbreaking signifies a new era. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the rebirth,‚Äù Hopkins said. Dr. Cyril Spann opened up a private practice just two doors down from the hospital. Both the hospital and Spann‚Äôs private practice are part of the National Register of Historic places, a signal of not on the hospital‚Äôs place in history, but of all the nurses and surgeons who worked inside of it. The renovated hospital will also be a permanent memorial to the Emanuel Nine, the nine clergy and church members who were murdered at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015. Copyright 2020 WIS.

The President of Nigeria Union in South Africa, Adetola Olubajo, made the disclosure in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos. Mr Olubajo said the development was as a result of an ugly incident that took place on Wednesday between a police officer and a Nigerian. He said that the Nigerian man, an indigene of Abakaliki in Ebonyi State, allegedly stabbed to death the police officer, Nico Visagie, during a disagreement at 5 a.m. Mr Olubajo said the details of the disagreement were still not very clear as the major witness was also stabbed multiple times and was still in critical condition at the hospital. ‚ÄúAfter the horrific incident, the community members of Keimoes and environs went on rampage burning and destroying properties belonging to foreign nationals, Nigerians in particular. ‚ÄúThese attacks spread to Upington and Nigerians and other foreign nationals were also expelled from Upington. ‚ÄúPrompt Police intervention this morning brought about calm but the situation is still tensed. Some locals were arrested by the police for public disturbance and malicious damage to properties. ‚ÄúThey appeared in a magistrates‚Äô court this morning for bail hearing,‚Äô‚Äô he said. He added that the suspect who stabbed the police officer had been arrested and would appear in court on or before next Monday.  ‚ÄúWe commend the swift intervention of the members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the arrest of the suspect is a welcome development. ‚ÄúWe hope the police will continue to maintain law and order in the area,‚Äô‚Äô Mr Olubajo said. Keimoes is a town in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. It lies on the Orange River and is about halfway between Upington and Kakamas.

"16",201,"https://www.aerotechnews.com/nellisafb/2020/01/31/shawna-kimbrell-first-african-american-female-fighter-pilot/","Shawna Kimbrell: First African American female fighter pilot","Lt. Col. Shawna Rochelle Kimbrell is the first female African American fighter pilot in the history of U.S. Air Force. She flew the F-16 Fighting Falcon during combat missions in Operation Northern Watch over northern Iraq. She is stationed at Nellis Air Force Base where she is a member of the 78th Attack Squadron, an Air Force Reserve Command unit under the 926th Wing, Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., where she serves as an MQ-9 Pilot and mission commander. Kimbrell was born in Lafayette, Ind., the youngest of four children, to Guyanese parents. Her mother and father, Eve Blackman Ng A Qui and Dr. Norman Ng A Qui migrated to the United States for educational opportunities and became naturalized U.S. citizens by the time she was born. Their hard work and dedication paid off in her father earning a degree from Howard University and a doctorate from Purdue University, which in turn earned him a job offer in Parker, Colo. That focus on education was a big part of life for Kimbrell and her three older siblings as they spent their school years in Parker. ‚Äú(Education) was the thing that opened doors,‚Äù Kimbrell said. ‚ÄúIf you got your education, you could do whatever you wanted to do. That was how our house was run.‚Äù On top of that family modus operandi, Kimbrell had a goal-driven personality from an early age. While in kindergarten, for example, she decided she wanted to be an astronaut, so she wrote a letter to NASA asking how she could join the program. But as she got older and did more research into joining the astronaut corps, she realized the career wasn‚Äôt as exciting as she wanted it to be. ‚ÄúI decided to focus on something I could do every day versus maybe going to the moon one time ‚Ä¶ which would be awesome, but it‚Äôs just one time,‚Äù the major said. ‚ÄúSo I started to look at the jets and flying fighters.‚Äù In fourth grade, Kimbrell decided she wanted to become a fighter pilot. She joined the Civil Air Patrol, worked at air shows, had her first flying lesson at 14, and earned her private pilot‚Äôs license. Eventually, she was accepted into the Air Force Academy. She did all of this despite people telling her as a child that there were no female fighter pilots, people asking her about all the what-ifs that would derail her plans. ‚ÄúI think what kept me on the straight and narrow is that I didn‚Äôt give myself any other options,‚Äù Kimbrell said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think about a back-up plan, I didn‚Äôt think about a ‚Äòwhat if it doesn‚Äôt work out plan.‚Äô ‚ÄúI think sometimes you lull yourself into thinking, ‚ÄòOK, I have that plan, and if it gets hard I‚Äôll go to the back-up plan,‚Äô‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have it, you push through.‚Äù And push through she did. Kimbrell graduated from the Academy in 1998 and was accepted into pilot training. She earned her pilot wings in August 1999. ‚ÄúI was in constant competition with myself, trying to do better, to make the grade,‚Äù the F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot said. ‚ÄúThere were times when I didn‚Äôt think that I was going to make it through. It was in those times I learned to be humble and realize there is a point in everyone‚Äôs struggle ‚Äî no matter how strong they are ‚Äî when they need help, and the key is to seek it out before it is too late.‚Äù Kimbrell attended undergraduate pilot training at Laughlin AFB, Texas, and received her commission in 1998 after graduating from the Air Force Academy. Later, she attended Undergraduate Pilot Training at Laughlin AFB, Texas, and was awarded her pilot wings in August 1999. She then completed Introduction to Fighter Fundamental training at Randolph AFB, Texas, in November 1999. In August 2000, she graduated from her initial F-16 training at Luke AFB, Ariz., becoming the first African American female fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force. She was assigned to the 13th Fighter Squadron, Misawa, Japan, for her first operational assignment. During this time she was deployed to Turkey and Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Northern and Southern Watch. Her flights in Operation Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly combat missions for Misawa‚Äôs 35th Fighter Wing. Additionally, during Operation Northern Watch she became the first African American female pilot to employ ordnance in combat. ‚ÄúThe sorties (in Operation Northern Watch) were actually anticlimactic until I recognized that people were actually shooting at us,‚Äù Kimbrell said. In July 2004, she graduated from the Joint Fire Control Course and was assigned to the 15th Air Support Operations Squadron. Later she deployed as the 2nd Brigade Air Liaison Officer in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Over the years, Kimbrell finds time to speak to children about dreaming big. She said she finds that a lot of children aren‚Äôt told that they can achieve their dreams and don‚Äôt realize that a lot of barriers have been knocked down. ‚ÄúI literally see the lights turn on in kids‚Äô eyes when I talk to them when they realize that someone like me can go do something as cool as (being a fighter pilot),‚Äù Kimbrell said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really awesome to be able to go out and talk to them and have them light up and say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve heard people say that you can do whatever you want, but now I can put a face to the story and I can see that it can be done, which means I can go out and do whatever I want to do.‚Äô That is what I focus on and what I think is really important.‚Äù Of course part of her speeches focus on education, as that is what her parents instilled in her. But she also tries to show the children and even the adults that reaching those big dreams, no matter what age you are or what you look like, starts with setting a goal. She uses an analogy of building a road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to build a road if you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going,‚Äù Kimbrell said. ‚ÄúA lot of people have goals, but don‚Äôt really put them into context. If a goal is really your end state, you have to look at the terrain you have to go through to get there, how you‚Äôre going to build that road and what you‚Äôre going to do. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs easy,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúExpect road blocks, expect that there are going to be people out there who don‚Äôt want you to succeed, expect people are going to tell you no. But the desire that comes from within ‚Äî if it‚Äôs something that you really want ‚Äî will carry you through.‚Äù Editor‚Äôs note: Tech. Sgt. Benjamin Rojek contributed to this report.

Image via Pexels South African‚Äôs living and working abroad are bracing themselves ahead of the implementation amendments to the Income Tax Act which have been dubbed the expat tax. The National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) announced major changes in the tax exemption on South African expatriates as far back as 2017, but the amended legislation takes effect from 1 March 2020. Under the amended legislation, South African tax residents working in other countries will only be exempt from paying tax on the first R1 million they earn abroad. Once an individual crosses the R1 million mark, they will be required by law to pay tax on all foreign earnings. South African tax residents who provide paid services outside of South Africa on behalf of an employer for longer than 183 days during a 12 month period will be granted an exemption. Director at law firm Garlicke & Bousfield, Graeme Palmer explained that the exemption only applies if during the same 12 month period a person rendered services outside South Africa for a continuous period of at least 60 days. ‚ÄúIf this criterion is met the resident is exempt from income tax on such foreign income in South Africa,‚Äù Palmer is quoted by BusinessTech. ‚ÄúThe amendment now provides that a person who meets these requirements will only be exempt from income tax in South Africa up to the first R1 million of their employment income earned abroad.‚Äù Palmer explains that the changes in legislation will only affect South African tax residents working abroad not former citizens or long-term expatriates who live and work abroad. In other words, South Africans who have permanently moved abroad will not be subject to double taxation. Such individuals will only need to pay tax in the country where they now live and work. For the law to apply a person would have to be present in South Africa for a certain amount of time through the tax year. ‚ÄúIt is important for expatriates to understand that the exemption only applies to South African tax residents working abroad,‚Äù Palmer said. ‚ÄúThese are persons who are still ordinarily resident in South Africa or have been physically present in South Africa for a statutory specified number of days each year over a five year period. ‚ÄúExpatriates who have been living abroad for many years or who have emigrated are unlikely to be effected by this law. They will only pay tax in the country where they now live and are employed.‚Äù Take our survey & stand a chance to WIN R6 000 in cash. CLICK HERE!

The drive-through attraction has been closed since a fire hit their location late last November in which several animals perished. Unfortunately, the reopening will have to wait a little longer. On Friday afternoon, the park announced that following Gov. Mike DeWine's clarification of his 'Stay Safe Ohio' order, it will not be permitted to open yet. ""The interpretation of the Order is currently under question, and the Park wants to ensure they are following all of the guidelines set forth by Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine. The Park is currently working with State and Local Ottawa County Officials to clarify when the Park will be permitted to open,"" African Safari Wildlife Park wrote in a statement on its website. African Safari Wildlife Park is expected to receive an update from the Ottawa County Health Department on its opening by early next week. The Park is asking ""its community members, friends, fans, and animal lovers around the Midwest to show their support for the Safari by purchasing a ticket through their online sale, hosted on their website. All proceeds from the promotion directly benefit the animals and their care."" All tickets purchased that were due to expire on June 30, 2020 are being extended to December 6, 2020. Once the Park is open and returns to Business-As-Usual, all purchasers of the May Reopening Sale tickets will receive two free cups of animal feed before entering the Drive-Thru Safari. The attraction gives guests the opportunity to come face-to-snout with more than 400 animals along the way, including alpacas, llamas, bactrian camels, elk, bison and zebra. Once the park reopens, giraffe and antelope will return to the drive-thru experience ""once the weather permits.""

This is how I ended up here. (Guest viewpoint)","Rumbila Abdullahi, second from left, visits family and friends at Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya in 2019. (Submitted photo) Have you ever been told that you don‚Äôt belong? Have you ever had the experience of being told that people like you aren‚Äôt welcome here? I know what that feels like. I am a member of the Somali Bantu community and a refugee here in Springfield. Now, let me tell you how I ended up here: At one time, my parents had a peaceful life in Somalia. It was 1991 when my parent‚Äôs whole life turned upside down. The civil war broke out in Somalia and the minority Somali Bantu became a target. Everything was taken away from my parents. The farm that they had worked so hard for was stolen from them. They were robbed and violently attacked. Knowing things were getting worse my parents made the difficult choice to leave Somalia and find safety in a refugee camp in Kenya. After years of being in the camp in Kenya, and when I was 7 years old, half of my family was granted the opportunity to come to America. We were resettled in Springfield and have now been here for 14 years. We consider Springfield our home. An executive order issued in September gave states and cities more say as to their willingness to continue refugee resettlement. For many decades, these decisions have been made at the federal level. Because he was given a choice, and after more than thirty years of welcoming refugees to Springfield, our city‚Äôs mayor now claims that refugees are a burden to the city and has decided that people like me are no longer welcome. As a proud graduate of Springfield Central High School and now a junior at Smith College, I ask myself why the leader of my city sees me and people like me as weighing Springfield down. As I pursue my chemistry degree and move forward on the pre-med track, I plan to become either a pediatrician or family medicine doctor. In the future, I plan to open my own clinic in Springfield. I am just one of the many refugees that aspire to do great things and take advantage of the opportunity that we have been given here in the United States. This past summer, I had the opportunity to travel back to Kenya to see my brothers, sisters, uncle, aunt, and grandmother in the refugee camp for the first time in 14 years. It broke my heart to see the harsh conditions in which they were living. Even more painful is knowing that there‚Äôs now even less possibility for them to get the same opportunity that I had to come to America. Because of our president‚Äôs executive order, my family back in Kenya may never be able to escape the grim reality they live in and my family may never be reunited. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Maryland blocked the president‚Äôs executive order which means that at least for now, Mayor Sarno will not be able to prevent refugees from being resettled in Springfield. This is good news, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that our mayor made it clear that he wants to end refugee resettlement in Springfield. His intent hasn‚Äôt changed because of a court ruling. We now know where he stands and that he sees people like me as a burden to this community. I may not have been born here, but Springfield is my city, too. Whether your family came to Springfield in the last few years or even two hundred years ago, perhaps you can relate to my story just a little bit. Our families and our ancestors all came here seeking an opportunity to build a better life. That‚Äôs what America is all about. We all have something to offer, no matter where we come from. Please don‚Äôt let anyone ever tell you or your family anything different. Mayor Sarno, you and your family are more than welcome to come visit my clinic here in Springfield once it‚Äôs open.

"24",383,"https://thefedupdemocrat.home.blog/2020/01/19/african-american-health-freedom-fighters/","African American Health Freedom Fighters","Fed Up Democrat Blogging for FREEDOM and CHOICE in New York City: Follow me on Twitter @DemocratFed Frederick Douglass, Dick Gregory, Jamel Holley and beyond! January 19, 2020 ‚Äî As we celebrate the life and sacrifice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I want to draw attention to all of the brave African American Health Freedom Fighters throughout our history and with us today. While many on this list will be perceived as controversial that is irrelevant: if you are African American and you fight, or have fought, for Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice, you belong on this list. (1) Frederick Douglass I first learned of Frederick Douglass‚Äô opposition to mandatory vaccination from the great Mary Holland. Douglass is, of course, the legendary 19th century African American abolitionist and civil rights leader. Very few people know that Douglass was staunchly opposed to mandatory vaccination. He noted that many who were vaccinated for small pox still died of small pox, so what was the point of the vaccination?! In 1882 Douglass told a reporter that mandatory vaccines encroached on people‚Äôs liberty and freedom of choice. (2) Jamel Holley I had never heard of Assemblyman Jamel Holley until January 10, 2020 when he boldly stood against the corrupt New Jersey Democratic party boss Stephen Sweeney. Holley opposed a bill that would have made the religious exemption to vaccination illegal in New Jersey public schools yet still allowed in private religious schools. He opposed the bill as segregationist and racist, which it clearly was. Not only did he oppose the bill, he lobbied his fellow African American legislators and got them to oppose it along with him. Currently Holley is standing firmly not only with the Black Community, but with the Health Freedom Movement as a whole, and my contacts are assuring me that Holley is the real-deal when it comes to Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice. The opportunistic, Big Pharma shill Stephen Sweeney is taking the racist position that Black legislators in New Jersey led by Holley are hurting children by not segregating them; a position that has no evidence to support it. This battle in New Jersey is now ground-zero for for America‚Äôs Health Freedom Movement in 2020. Jamel Holley is a brave man who needs and deserves all of our support! (3) Curtis Cost Curtis Cost is by far the most important African American Health Freedom Fighter alive and active today. His 1991 book ‚ÄúVaccines are Dangerous‚Äù was the first book penned by an African American on the topic of vaccine safety. Cost has been educating thousands of people for decades on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and continues his invaluable activism today. His controversial Harlem Vaccine Forum was far and away the most important Health Freedom event of 2019, and he ended the year with the very successful Great Harlem Vaccine Debate. Cost is in the midst of planning resistance and protests to Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs Big Pharma sponsored vaccine promotional tour. (4) Dick Gregory The late, great comedian and activist Dick Gregory may be the man responsible for popularizing and spreading the vegan lifestyle within the African American community. Gregory would often appear publicly with Dr. Gary Null to discuss issues of health and healing. While Gregory didn‚Äôt always get all of the facts correct when he spoke on matters of health and science, it didn‚Äôt matter; that is not what made him so incredibly important. If it wasn‚Äôt for him hundreds of thousands, if not millions of African Americans would have never even heard that a vegetarian lifestyle was a healthy option and that vaccination posed immediate dangers. The last few years of his life Gregory had grown very bitter, and when looking at the world around us I can understand why. But I don‚Äôt remember Gregory just for the last few years of his life; his legacy is far too powerful for that as he has awoken many people and saved many lives. (5) Virstyne Henry Virstyne Henry is a vaccine-injured Health Freedom Activist. She has been researching the dangers of vaccines ever since she learned her asthma ‚Äì which she thought was from birth ‚Äì didn‚Äôt arise until after she was given a DTaP vaccine as an infant. Upon realizing this she researched the topic veraciously. Henry participated as a panelist in The Great Harlem Vaccine Debate in December of 2019. She continues to pursue all types of truths on https://www.truthertalk.com/ where you can catch her interviewing many guests on a wide range of topics, especially on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. (6) Nancy Turner Banks Dr. Nancy Turner Banks MD is author of ‚ÄúAIDS, Opium, Diamonds and Empire,‚Äù and is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. Trained in surgery, obstetrics, gynecology, and gynecological oncology, she practiced general obstetrics and gynecology for twenty-five years. In addition, she earned an MBA in finance. Banks is an extremely outspoken critic of the CDC‚Äôs vaccine schedule for children. (7) Minister Louis Farrakhan The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan is nothing if he is not controversial. When his name is mentioned the very first thought to all who devour mainstream media is ‚Äúantisemitism.‚Äù Regardless of these controversies I know for a fact Minister Farrakhan is 100% correct on his stance regarding vaccination as well as fluoridation. Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam (NOI) have helped many truths regarding health and healing to access and assist the Black Community. There are at least two other members of NOI that need to be mentioned here as well. (8) Tony Muhammad Minister Tony Muhammad has been fighting to get the truth out regarding the dangers of vaccines for years. He has protested in front of the CDC Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia as well as lectured and given multiple interviews on the topic. To quote him directly from the speech he gave in front of CDC Headquarters: ‚ÄúThe Pharmaceutical industry is very powerful. They are the richest lobby group in the world. Minister Farrakhan‚Äôs love is so deep for Black and oppressed people that no forces on earth can get him to sell our people out. He loves the truth and is a warner to our people.‚Äù (9) Rizza Islam Rizza Islam is a young NOI brother who speaks very clearly and boldly, and when it comes to vaccination he pulls no punches stating there is a plot to kill and disable Black men through the childhood vaccination schedule. As wild as that may sound to many people, the movie VAXXED uncovered that the CDC has known for years that the MMR vaccine given at 18 months of age results in an autism rate 340% higher in African American boys than in any other group. Rizza Islam is able to reach many Black youth regarding the dangers of vaccination, and he recognizes that fighting forced vaccination is a universal struggle for all regardless of race, ethnicity, social status, or class. (10) Sheila Ealey Sheila Ealey became internationally known from the movie VAXXED, where she was featured along side her autistic son Temple Ealey. She told her story of how her son was accidentally given 2 MMR shots at the same time. From that point on her boy was never the same again. Ealey has been a strong, passionate voice for Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice ever since. She has traveled the country and the world to help educate and advocate on the dangers of vaccines. To hear this Warrior Mom speak is a true spiritual experience! (11) Dr. Phil Valentine I first heard of the Reverend Dr. Phil Valentine at The Harlem Vaccine Forum. He is extremely knowledgeable and has helped hundreds of African American families receive religious exemptions to vaccination in New York (before the religious exemption law was repealed). Valentine said his exemptions were challenged in court three times by the Department of Education, and all three times he won. When he went to the courts to receive the transcripts for those three cases either the court transcripts had been sealed or lost, according to Valentine. He has a powerful message that covers many topics, including child sex trafficking where he gives a little praise to President Donald Trump for combating the horrifying practice. (12) Dead Prez Stic Man & M1 form the Revolutionary Hip-Hop duo known as ‚ÄúDead Prez.‚Äù While they have never explicitly spoken out against mandatory vaccination it is clearly & loudly implied through the lyrics in their songs and the vegan lifestyles they choose to live. In their song ‚ÄúBe Healthy‚Äù they say, ‚ÄúLet your food be your medicine, no excederin, strictly herbs that I raise in the sun ‚Äôcause I got melanin‚Ä¶They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy. My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy, ‚Äôcause true wealth comes from good health and wise ways, we got to start takin‚Äô better care of ourselves.‚Äú In their youth the duo would rhyme about atheism and Marxist Revolution, however as they matured I have been told they have gone deep into Eastern Mysticism exploring and expanding their spiritual quests. (13) Charles Barron Charles Barron is a former Black Panther Party member and a current state Assemblyman representing Brooklyn. He is a member of the Assembly Health Committee in Albany, NY. When the religious exemption to vaccination was up for repeal Barron voted NO in the Health Committee and NO on the floor of the assembly. His words in the Health Committee were clear and powerful. Unfortunately he did not lobby other New York Democrats to join him in voting NO, the way Jamel Holley did and continues to do in New Jersey. (14) Rodneyse Bichotte Rodneyse Bichotte is an Assemblywoman representing Brooklyn and, like Barron, is also a member of the Assembly Health Committee. She also voted NO to repealing the religious exemption to vaccination in both the committee and floor votes. Bichotte stated on the floor of the Assembly that she had been given the MMR vaccine as a child yet still got measles twice after that. She reminded everyone that when the HIV/AIDS epidemic first came on the scene it was wrongly blamed on Haitians, just as unvaccinated children were being blamed for spreading measles today; both of those claims are false and there is no evidence to support either of them. I only wish that the Assemblywoman will take the next, natural step of actively seeking support for Health Freedom from her fellow Democratic colleagues in Albany. (15) Chantel Jackson Chantel Jackson is a Bronx candidate for Assembly that is gaining major endorsements on her path to Albany. She is firmly, and completely, a Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice candidate. She is also a Democrat. The FED UP DEMOCRAT enthusiastically and completely endorses Chantel Jackson! Jackson has spoken firmly in support of allowing religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccination, she has spoken out against making the HPV vaccine mandatory to attend school, and she has expressed reservations regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine. The Daily News reported all of this as if Jackson was out of her mind. However the reality is that Jackson is part of a growing voice of African American female politicians who believe in the principals of Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice. Rodneyse Bichotte and Tremaine Wright are two African American assemblymembers who voted against the repeal of the religious exemption to vaccination on June 13, 2019. Both are from Brooklyn and already hold seats in Albany as they continue to be rising stars in the Democratic Party. Bichotte is now the Democratic Party Boss in Brooklyn, and Wright may be headed for the Senate this election season as Senator Velmanette Montgomery has announced she is leaving her Senate seat and has endorsed Wright to succeed her. Jackson has also been endorsed by Assemblyman Michael Blake, Senator Luis Sepulveda and Senator Brian Benjamin. It is interesting to note all of these endorsements come from Democrats who voted to repeal the religious exemption to vaccination on June 13, 2019 even though Jackson would have never supported such a Draconian measure. The Democratic party in New York is split on this issue and ‚Äì due to continued Health Freedom activism ‚Äì the principals of parental choice and medical freedom are gaining traction within the party. *** I am sure there are many important Health Freedom Fighters I left out that belong on this list. Nick Canon is woke too. LikeLike Great article ‚Äì thanks for sharing! I‚Äôm in NJ and watching the situation closely. Proud of Jamel Holley! LikeLike I have to say I am really, really impressed with Jamel Holley. He has come out the gate as a true champion of Health & Religious Freedom. All of the Democrats in New York who supported us never came out full force the way I am seeing Holley come. Holley is helping Health Freedom & Vaccine Choice to become a nationally recognized voting issue. LikeLike Comments are closed. You must be logged in to post a comment.","none","black",0,0,0,0

"26",406,"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/1/29/why-african-countries-seek-greater-role-in-libya-peace-process","Why African countries seek greater role in Libya peace process","Summit in DRC comes almost two weeks after world powers met in Berlin to end foreign meddling in North African state. African Union leaders are expected to renew calls for greater involvement in efforts to resolve Libya‚Äôs long-running conflict at a summit held on Thursday in the Republic of the Congo. The meeting in Brazzaville will be held almost two weeks after international stakeholders ‚Äì including many who back opposite sides in the months-long battle over Libya‚Äôs capital, Tripoli ‚Äì gathered in Berlin and agreed to push the warring sides for a permanent ceasefire and respect an existing United Nations arms embargo. The oil-rich North African country has been beset by war and insecurity since the 2011 overthrow and killing of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi during a NATO-backed uprising, with rival factions and militias fighting over control of the county. Libya has since been split into rival western and eastern administrations: the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) holds Tripoli in northwestern Libya, while a rival administration in the east is aligned with renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces in April 2019 launched a military offensive to seize the capital. ‚ÄúThe whole African continent is worried about the consequences of what is happening in Libya,‚Äù Senegalese President Macky Sall said on Tuesday during a news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Dakar. Sall called for the bloc‚Äôs involvement ‚Äúin any search for a solution‚Äù, which he said could only be political. The push for greater AU say is led by the countries bordering Libya, especially in the Sahel region, which fear the crisis will have a greater knock-on effect on an escalating conflict with armed groups operating across the region including in Chad, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. The worsening violence in the region involves fighters linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) and last year killed more than 4,000 people. At the root of the Sahelian countries‚Äô concerns is the number of arms flowing into the region from Libya. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no doubt that the 2011 war in Libya had ripple effects across the Sahel in the form of weapons being transferred from Libya into neighbouring countries to the south,‚Äù Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst for the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera. ‚ÄúWhat that is creating is a different perspective between Sahel countries and European countries on what the solution in Libya should be,‚Äù she added. Divisions among European countries, particularly France and Italy, have hampered efforts to find a solution to the conflict, with Rome backing the UN-brokered GNA and Paris widely seen as supportive of Haftar. ‚Äú[In Africa,] Chad sees Haftar as the necessary strongman for Libya. It has encouraged other African countries to take a pro-Haftar line ‚Ä¶ at the expense of support for the GNA who Sahel countries do not see as a strong and long-term counterpart,‚Äù Gazzini said. Armed groups operating in the Sahel, especially Jama‚Äôat Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), are also able to find safe haven within some of most Libya‚Äôs most unstable regions, where aligned armed groups hold territory. Heni Nsaibia, a senior researcher for the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), said ‚Äúthe links between Libya and the Sahel consist of movements by Sahelian [mostly JNIM] militants back and forth between the two locations‚Äù, especially along Libya‚Äôs border with Niger and Algeria. ‚ÄúThe links to Ubari are strong,‚Äù he told Al Jazeera. Located in southwestern Libya, Ubari has long been used by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar Dine fighters for leisure and recovery. Several senior AQIM trainers have been repeatedly targeted by US drone attacks there. Niger meanwhile shares border with Nigeria to the south, which has allowed armed groups from all three countries to form a geographical chain from North to sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äì for example, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) was recently incorporated into Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) or Boko Haram, which has its origins in Nigeria. ‚ÄúThe Sahel is suffering from this crisis. Proliferation of arms in the region has facilitated the spread of terrorism,‚Äù Chad‚Äôs Foreign Minister Mahamat Zene Cherif said last week. The Brazzaville gathering will not be the first time the AU has sought to play a more prominent role in solving the Libyan crisis. Previous efforts however have failed, including a bid last year for a joint UN-AU envoy for Libya, and Thursday‚Äôs meeting of the AU High Level Committee on Libya looks unlikely to offer a breakthrough. ‚ÄúThe AU has been in and out of peace negotiations in Libya for the last 10 years,‚Äù Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera. ‚ÄúThe African Union regards Libya as within its mandate, even though its peace initiatives there have consistently fallen flat,‚Äù he said. Libya remains a top priority for the UN Security Council and so far the body has given little attention to AU calls for more involvement. Egypt, another stakeholder in the peace talks which shares a border with Libya, sees Libya as an Arab issue and is also unlikely to give backing to any AU-brokered deal. When peace talks started nine years ago, African presidents who tried to become involved in brokering peace found difficulties establishing links with rebels based in Benghazi. AU countries meanwhile have only a small diplomatic presence in Libya and in neighbouring Tunisia, where many of the international stakeholders‚Äô embassies are located and meetings on peace in Libya usually take place. ‚ÄúThey keep a relatively low profile apart from demanding a greater role to solve the conflict,‚Äù Gazzini said. ‚ÄúThis demand is not matched with political knowledge about the conflict.‚Äù Follow Al Jazeera English:","none","none",0,0,0,0
"27",410,"https://blog.ucsusa.org/rachel-cleetus/east-african-locust-crisis-shows-climate-change-threatens-food/","East African Locust Crisis Shows how Climate Change Threatens Food Security","Huge swarms of desert locusts are advancing across the Horn of Africa, threatening crops that millions of people depend on for food. UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) Director-General Qu Dongyu has called this ‚Äúa situation of international dimensions that threatens the food security of the entire subregion.‚Äù The unprecedented scale of this infestation has been fueled by climate change, which has contributed to ocean conditions favorable for the unusually high number of cyclones (8 in 2019) and extreme rainfall in the region, creating ideal breeding conditions for locusts. For many, the word ‚Äòlocusts‚Äô conjures up images of a biblical plague. And, indeed, these are among the oldest migratory pests in the world. Although they are related to and look like grasshoppers, their behavior is decidedly more devastating when they enter their so-called ‚Äògregarious‚Äô phase. When food and environmental conditions are favorable, locusts congregate in swarms that can travel hundreds of miles. They are ravenous eaters, capable of decimating pasture and food crops quickly. The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is the most damaging of the species. While locusts have always existed in the areas affected by the current crisis, the scale and rapid spread of this infestation are exceptional. And with many millions of people in harm‚Äôs way, the potential repercussions for food security and livelihoods are grim‚Äîwhich is why the FAO, local governments and humanitarian organizations are sounding the alarm. This locust crisis has been building for a few months now, dating back to last summer. But it has now reached proportions that have not been seen in over 70 years in Kenya and 25 years in the Horn of Africa. Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia are among the countries worst affected. Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Sudan and Uganda could also face increasing risks if the threat is not quickly contained. Locust swarms have also been a menace in India, Iran, Oman, Pakistan and Yemen. Map of the current situation of the desert locust infestation, Jan 28 2020. In Africa, the swarms cover a rapidly growing area. According to the FAO, swarms can move 150 kilometers (about 90 miles) a day, a similar distance as the crow flies between Washington DC and Richmond, VA. The size of these swarms is hard to comprehend from a distance. An article in the Washington Post noted: ‚ÄúA single swarm can contain up to 150 million locusts per square kilometer of farmland, an area the size of almost 250 football fields, regional authorities say. One especially large swarm in northeastern Kenya measured 60 kilometers long by 40 kilometers wide (37 miles long by 25 miles wide).‚Äù (That is nearly 90% of the land area of Rhode Island!) Alarmingly, left unchecked, the crisis is likely to grow a lot worse. Rains starting in March are expected to continue to favor rapid breeding of the locusts and could cause their numbers to grow 500 times by June! While desert locusts are known to affect this area, the conditions being experienced now are exceptional. According to the FAO and the World Meteorological Organization, the heavy rains and devastating cyclones that affected Eastern Africa last fall are major contributing factors. These wet conditions have provided the perfect habitat and food for locusts to thrive. An ocean circulation pattern called the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)‚Äîwhich affects weather from Eastern Africa to Australia‚Äîhad a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù phase in 2019 that was the strongest in 60 years. Evidence is mounting that strong positive phases of the IOD occur more often with climate change. The strong temperature difference on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean, associated with the positive phase of the IOD, contributed to the conditions leading up to the devastating Australian bushfires and severe rain and flooding in East Africa. In March and April 2019 Cyclones Idai and Kenneth‚Äîwhich hit within 6 weeks of each other‚Äîcaused devastating flooding in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Over a thousand people lost their lives. Cyclone Idai ranks as one of the deadliest storms to hit the Southern hemisphere. The extreme wet weather created conditions that were very favorable for the locusts to reproduce and multiply quickly, including promoting vegetation in normally arid areas for them to feed on. Climate scientists and experts on the ground have emphasized these connections in their comments. According to Guleid Artan, director of IGAD‚Äôs Climate Predictions and Applications Center. ‚ÄúThe Desert Locust outbreak was clearly worsened by the unusually heavy rains experienced in the region. This has been a year of extremes and climate anomalies for East Africa, a region that hosts some of the most vulnerable populations of the world. 2019 brought us unusual cyclonic activity ‚Äì 8 cyclones, the highest number in a single year since 1976, forming over the northern Indian Ocean -, droughts, floods and a desert locust outbreak. Our Climate is changing and it is already leading to hundreds of casualties and affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in our region‚Äù Nairobi-based climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker was quoted in an AP story: Heavy rains in East Africa made 2019 one of the region‚Äôs wettest years on record, said Nairobi-based climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker. He blamed rapidly warming waters in the Indian Ocean off Africa‚Äôs eastern coast, which also spawned an unusual number of strong tropical cyclones off Africa last year. Heavy rainfall and warmer temperatures are favorable conditions for locust breeding and in this case the conditions have become ‚Äúexceptional,‚Äù he said. Desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) The East Africa region already faces high levels of food insecurity, with over 19 million people in Crisis (measured as Phase 3 or above on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or IPC scale), according to the October 2019-Januray 2020 outlook from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. And climate change is making things worse. The 2018 IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5C highlighted the many ways climate change threatens food security. We have already increased average global temperatures by a little over 1 degree Celsius and are witnessing a range of changes around the world in worsening risks of drought, extreme rainfall, flooding, wildfire and destructive storms, all climate extremes that can destroy crops and kill livestock. This latest locust crisis in East Africa underscores that the threat to people‚Äôs food security is here and now. Many of the places in Eastern Africa that are affected by the locust plague‚Äîincluding Ethiopia and Sudan‚Äîhad been experiencing a prolonged multi-year drought prior to this, which had already placed a severe stress on food security. And now, cascading climate impacts‚Äîdrought, followed by extreme rain, followed by a plague of locusts‚Äîare set to take a devastating toll on regions and people that simply do not have the resources to cope. The FAO has estimated that there is an immediate urgent need for at least $70 million for Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia to take steps to limit the spread of locusts and to protect people‚Äôs livelihoods. Money is desperately needed for rapid assessments of the locust threat as it advances and for aerial spraying to limit the infestation. More will be needed to help those on the ground to rebuild livelihoods and ensure access to adequate food supplies in the months to come. Longer term needs in these countries and others affected must also be addressed. As the UN has pointed out, there is a narrow window to act to contain the crisis ahead of the next period of rain. Aid must flow quickly. At a briefing today, FAO chief Qu Dong said: ‚ÄúIf after April the money has come, it‚Äôs somehow useless. So the timing, location, is crucial.‚Äù USAID, NASA, NOAA and other US agencies have long played an important role in contributing to global early warning systems, monitoring, and ongoing assistance to cope with these kinds of humanitarian crises. Our government must step up to do more now in this hour of crisis. This is a matter of life and death for millions of people. The bigger picture challenge is clear: we must act swiftly to limit the harms from further climate change. We must cut our heat-trapping emissions rapidly, in line with what the science shows is necessary. We must invest in climate resilience‚Äîboth at home and in least developed nations enduring the ravages of climate change. We, the more affluent nations most responsible for carbon emissions to-date, also bear responsibility for the pain and suffering we are inflicting on people across the world right now‚Äîsuffering which inevitably falls hardest on those who have the least and live on the edge of subsistence already. The US has a unique responsibility as a rich nation that is responsible for a leading share of the heat-trapping emissions that are fueling the changes to our climate we see today. And right now, our government is completely failing to do its part‚Äîeven worse, it is actively trying to undermine global and domestic climate action. As we lay the groundwork for future climate policy in the US, let‚Äôs not forget our international obligations.

These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. Africa editor Last year, Africa had some of world‚Äôs fastest-growing economies and 2020 won‚Äôt be very different. A few of the countries on the top 10 list may have changed but the IMF, World Bank and other institutions all expect above global average GDP growth. The top performers will be South Sudan (8.2%), Rwanda (8.1%) C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire (7.3%), Ethiopia (7.2%), Senegal (6.8%), Benin (6.7%) and Uganda (6.2%) along with Kenya, Mozambique, Niger and Burkina Faso all expecting 6% growth. While these countries help push up Africa‚Äôs overall average economic growth rate forecast to 3.8% (or 3.6% for Sub Saharan Africa), these averages are weighed down closer to the global average (3.4%) by the two largest economies, Nigeria (2.5%) and South Africa (1.1%). Nigeria‚Äôs outlook has improved after a strong end to 2019, but most economic watchers believe it needs to grow much faster to pull large chunks of its 200-million strong population out of poverty. Economic reform has been slower than expected since February 2019‚Äôs presidential election. South Africa‚Äôs meager growth rates are exacerbated by its ongoing electricity crisis and overall political stasis. Its leaders will likely spend part of the year dreading an inevitable debt downgrade. Since 2020 is seen as the start of a new decade, Brookings Institution‚Äôs annual Foresight Africa report looked at the average economic growth forecasts for the next five years till 2024. This predicts Senegal (8.3%), Rwanda (7.9%), Niger (7.3% ), Uganda (7.2%) and Mozambique (6.9%) as the five fastest growing over that period. While these forecasts are promising, most economists and investors are paying more attention to how the reality of climate change will impact their economic prognostications. Brookings highlights research which shows lowered crop yields, lower labor and agricultural productivity and damage to human health due to climate change will significantly decrease GDP in Africa. Global temperatures rising as much as 3¬∞C by 2100 would have a disproportionate impact on Africa with aggregate GDP potentially dropping by as much as 8.6% after that year. But on a more hopeful note Brookings analysts say there‚Äôs a $16 billion opportunity if African countries fully implement the African Continental Free Tree Agreement (AfCFTA). In the ideal scenario where there‚Äôs a 100% liberalization of tariffs across African member states under the agreement, the continent‚Äôs aggregate GDP would jump to $3 trillion by 2030 from $2.1 trillion today. In this scenario there would be a 33% increase in intra-African exports and 1.2% increase in employment. One less optimistic economic highlight from the last few years has been growing concern about Africa‚Äôs rising debt and this continues into 2020. Most of the worry has been about eurobond debt with African countries issuing some $26 billion in eurobonds in 2019 more or less equivalent to 2018. Or, put another way, Africa issued more eurobonds in 2018 and 2019 that it did in all the years combined from 2003 to 2016. While African eurobonds have been great for international investors seeking higher yields away from US treasuries, ‚Äúthe scale of issuance keeps prompting questions about default even though it amounted to just 1% of Africa‚Äôs 2019 GDP ($2.4 billion),‚Äù writes Charles Robertson of Renaissance Capital. But of course, Africa is not a country and there will be trouble spots if care is not taken. üåç Keep up with developments and emerging industries in Africa.

In Barangay San Isidro Sur alone, more than 300 pigs will be subjected to culling to prevent the spread of ASF. Authorities have dug up an area where the pigs will be buried, according to a Balitanghali report on Wednesday. The local government said the calamity fund will be used to help affected hog raisers. Meanwhile, three other areas‚ÄîMalasiqui, Basista and Dagupan City‚Äîin the province started conducting the 1-7-10 protocol. Under the said protocol, pigs within the 1-kilometer radius from affected areas will be culled. Those within seven kilometers will be placed under surveillance, while cases of pigs who get sick and are within 10 km from the affected areas will have to be reported to the Department of Agriculture. Earlier this month, the DA said that the number of ASF cases is declining, but that the Philippines cannot yet be declared ASF-free. ‚ÄîKG, GMA News","none","none",0,0,0,0

They are perhaps the closet creatures, next to whales, we have similar to dinosaurs. Their sheer size is mesmerizing, but it‚Äôs their other features that make them one of our favorite animals. They have big floppy ears, long tusks, and of course, their insanely long trunks. Most folks only think of elephant trunks as their nose. However, it turns out that this part of their body is much more complicated. An elephant‚Äôs trunk is actually a fusion of their upper lip and nose. It‚Äôs used for smelling, breathing, touching, grasping, and making those adorable elephant sounds we all love. This all-purpose snozz even helps elephants eat and drink. And yes, they eat and drink a lot. In fact, the average elephant eats between 100 and 200 pounds of plants every day. And they drink about 30 to 50 gallons of water daily! In couple in South Africa were having a private pool party in 2010, when they had an unexpected visitor stroll in and crash their party. It was a massive male African elephant who decided to come over and help himself to a little drink from their pool. Now, some folks were concerned that the pool was chlorinated. However, the uploader of the video assures us it was not. And besides, I highly doubt the elephant‚Äôs sensitive nose would have allowed it to drink from a chlorinated pool. Source: YouTube Watching this graceful animal move is fun to watch, they seem to have such precise control over their trunk, it looks like they could use it to do anything we can do with our hands!

"34",455,"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/13/yinka-shonibare-london-nigeria-african-renaissance","Yinka Shonibare: √¢‚Ç¨ÀúI see what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening as an African renaissance√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢","The artist talks about his project spaces in London and Nigeria, and Africa‚Äôs untapped artistic potential Over the past decade, I‚Äôve been running a project space for emerging artists in east London called Guest Projects. Based just off Broadway Market, it supports practitioners in a variety of disciplines, from visual artists to musicians to theatre companies. Not long after setting it up in 2008, I decided I wanted to make the project international. As I have roots in Nigeria, and the creative scene there is so exciting, Nigeria seemed like the right place to do it. About eight years ago, I acquired some land in Lagos. Now we‚Äôre in the process of building a residency in Lekki, a rapidly developing area in the east of the city. It will house three artists at a time, with studio and gallery spaces on the ground floor, and residents‚Äô bedrooms above. The project also extends to a 30-acre farm in Ijebu, three hours northeast of Lagos. We‚Äôre in the process of landscaping and building a barn house and studios for artists, using sustainable materials such as mud, as well as a walled garden where people can learn about indigenous plants. Lagos is a very busy urban area with a lot of nightlife and music, so Ijebu will be for artists who need a more quiet space to produce work on a larger scale (there also will be a sculpture garden on the farm). The Guest Artists Space (G.A.S.) Foundation, as the new project is called, will be a two-way exchange. International visitors will be able to offer advice and support to local artists, but they will also receive knowledge. There‚Äôs so much to learn in Africa, and so many amazing artists and intellectuals, and the project spaces will provide a platform for exchange, for debate, for collaboration. There will be opportunities for visitors to work alongside African artists, to debate alongside them, to explore work, and leave with a completely different perspective. I‚Äôve done residencies myself in the past and I always come back with a changed view of the world. African artists have always been there, doing fantastic work, and the rest of the world is only just catching up. When I was growing up in Nigeria in the 1970s, the music scene was incredible, thanks to artists such as Fela Kuti, and culture was very much part of my early experience. The arts suffered under the military regime in the 1980s and 90s, but Nigeria is more democratic now and the liberal arts are thriving again. The city has the Art X Lagos art fair, which draws collectors and artists from around the world. The middle class is growing and people have more disposable income. And there is still so much untapped potential. I see what‚Äôs happening in Nigeria and across the continent as a kind of African renaissance. As well as facilitating cultural exchange and giving artists a space to work in, I want this project to support the local ecosystem and economy. In Ijebu, I have employed 12 farm workers, installed five greenhouses (growing tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables) and planted two acres each of maize, plantain and cassava. The point of all this is to help develop food security and sustainability in an area where unemployment is high and food supply is precarious. Bringing people to the farm, for arts events as well as residencies, should also provide a boost for the local economy. There have been challenges along the way. I‚Äôve learned that when you‚Äôre doing a building project, you have to be extremely patient with things like planning permission. And when you set up a foundation, you have to listen to the board of trustees. You can‚Äôt just go ahead and do things yourself, like you would in a studio. But the project is coming together. The farm is operational now and we should have the buildings and project spaces finished by the end of 2020. The building in Lagos will be ready by mid-2021 ‚Äì I may launch it to coincide with the art fair in November that year. And we‚Äôve got a very interesting, diverse range of trustees on our board, including artists El Anatsui, Njideka Akunyili Crosby, and Olafur Eliasson. As with the space in London, the residencies in Nigeria will be multi-disciplinary, rather than focusing narrowly on visual arts. Each residency will last three months, but we also want to offer long-term support for individual artists, equipping them to thrive not just survive, and I will be collaborating with other institutions and individuals to achieve that. International exchange has a very strong value, especially in a world where there‚Äôs a great deal of conflict, and I believe that going to see other cultures, and being creative with other cultures, is really a very positive way forward. It can be a true vehicle for social change.","UK","black",0,0,0,0
"35",464,"https://www.theroot.com/tom-steyer-picks-up-3-black-surrogates-from-the-carolin-1841062145","Tom Steyer African American Endorsements in South Carolina","Tom Steyer, who is making some surprising inroads with African-American voters in South Carolina, has just picked up two more endorsements from powerful members of the state‚Äôs Democratic leadership and one more from neighboring North Carolina. Johnnie Cordero, chairman of the Democratic Black Caucus of South Carolina, and South Carolina state representative Jerry Govan, chairman of the Black Legislative Caucus, are throwing their support behind the billionaire candidate, Steyer‚Äôs campaign told The Root exclusively. The former president of the North Carolina Democratic Party‚Äôs African American Caucus, Linda Wilkins-Daniels, is also endorsing Steyer. One of the reasons Cordero is backing Steyer is because of his campaign‚Äôs commitment to empowering black people with paid positions and what he feels is the candidate‚Äôs readiness to tackle tough issues like police brutality. ‚ÄúWhat I looked at was really simple: we need to have candidates who come into South Carolina and don‚Äôt come in and kiss babies and shake hands and say a couple of words,‚Äù Cordero said. ‚ÄúTom Steyer came into town, he put together his team of people from South Carolina. He didn‚Äôt bring people in from outside. They are people we know in the community and he‚Äôs spent his money with black businesses. He‚Äôs employing black people. That, to me, is significant. You demonstrate how serious you are by how you spend the money. Some candidates have spent 20 and 30 million dollars and want to come to South Carolina and want us to volunteer for everything. Tom Steyer is not like that.‚Äù Get 26% off and Spend 100% Less Time Cleaning Equipped with its own self-empty station, this vacuum connects to Alexa devices and allows you to create maps of your rooms, so you can be completely hands-off. State Representative Govan told me that while he was drawn to the candidate because of his views on climate change, he and Steyer really bonded over their shared Christian faith when the candidate visited the state last summer. ‚ÄúI at that point thought that his gentleman had a message that needed to be heard,‚Äù said Govan, who says he is good friends with Joe Biden and was his 2008 South Carolina presidential campaign co-chair. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Tom at that time was registering at one percent in terms of any polls. But I thought that he deserved to be heard. So, I did a deep dive in terms of his background in those causes and because we had so much in common, it just took off from there.‚Äù In a statement announcing her endorsement, Wilkins-Daniels stated that Steyer took a position on reparations when former President Barack Obama declined to do so and that he ‚Äúgets it.‚Äù ‚ÄúTom Steyer wouldn‚Äôt be the type of president to build walls to keep immigrants out and still exploit them while they‚Äôre here. He‚Äôs also not beholden to any political action committee, corporation, lobbyist, or large donor‚Äîwhich has been the way of Washington. In fact, Tom Steyer funded many Democratic candidates and causes that were beneficial for mankind. He has shown repeatedly that he sees the dignity and worth of all people regardless of whether a person resides in a penthouse, trailer, homeless shelter, or personal vehicle on the streets.‚Äù Cordero and Govan‚Äôs support, which does not reflect the bodies they represent, puts Steyer‚Äôs black surrogate number at 13. When Steyer jumped in the race, few people thought he would be one of the few remaining white men in the Caucasian male tsunami of the 2020 Democratic primary field. But a Fox poll has Steyer at second place behind Biden. Of course, being a billionaire helps. He‚Äôs spent more money on TV ads than the rest of the other candidates combined if you don‚Äôt count Michael Bloomberg, the other billionaire. One of the criticisms directed at Steyer has been of his extraordinary wealth and how it allows political novices to spend money on ads that keep him on voters‚Äô radars in ways Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former HUD Secretary Juli√°n Castro could not. Govan said Steyer‚Äôs wealth should not be held against him. If anything, he should be praised as one of the billionaires who have pledged to give his money to charity and that he has contributed to very worthy causes over the years. ‚ÄúAre we going to continuously penalize people for being successful in this country?‚Äù Govan asked. ‚ÄúI should hope not.‚Äù Everyone who made predictions on which candidates would still be in the race at this point are as accurate as most people who fill out a March Madness bracket. While few people expected Steyer to be in the race at this point, it is notable that he is gaining the traction he is enjoying‚Äîeven with his billions. We‚Äôll see how much his presence means for what will be a very interesting Democratic primary.","none","none",0,0,0,0

Africa, which has important trade relations with China, is closely monitoring the situation. The epidemic, which began in late December in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly around the world and now affects 13 countries. Some 5,974 people have been infected by the virus, according to Chinese officials. Over 80 people have already lost their lives. Will the coronavirus epidemic spread to the African continent? Africa is paying particular attention to the evolution of the epidemic, especially as the continent maintains a significant flow of trade with China. According to Beijing, trade between Africa and China increased by 2.2% in 2019, reaching $208 billion (189 billion euros), and the continent welcomed 121 million Chinese visitors in 2017 against 31 million in 2005. ‚ÄúEthiopia, Kenya and South Africa are the main countries receiving travellers from China‚Äù, says Dr Ambrose Talisuna, epidemiologist and WHO regional adviser for health security in Africa. ‚ÄúIn these countries, we have recommended to the authorities that they strengthen the screening of travellers at airports, including taking their body temperature.‚Äù READ The potential economic impact of coronavirus on Africa The World Health Organization recommends setting up quarantine rooms in airports, as well as preparing hospitals to receive potential patients. China is the largest market outside Africa for Ethiopian Airlines, which runs 35 passenger flights per week, direct and daily, and 15 cargo flights, serving the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Chengdu.

C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire reported Sunday its first suspected case of the coronavirus, according to the Ivorian Minister of Health, Dr Eugene Aou√©l√© Aka. ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene has been alerted by the airport authorities of Abidjan of the presence of a patient in an aircraft of Turkish Airlines from Beijing, bound for Abidjan,‚Äù read the statement. ‚ÄúIt is a 34-year-old student from C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire who has been living in Beijing for five years and who presented an influenza-like illness with coughing, sneezing, runny nose and breathing difficulty, which began on January 22, 2020 in Beijing.‚Äù The patient was transferred to the pandemic cell at the F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny Airport in Abidjan. Pending analysis results, this is the first suspected case of coronavirus on the continent. On 23 January, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced ‚Äúenhanced surveillance measures at ports of entry. Travelers arriving from Wuhan are subject to many questions upon arrival about possible symptoms of the disease and their travel itinerary,‚Äù it said. A similar measure and increased surveillance has been put in place at airports in Kenya. Algeria, Morocco, Burkina Faso, Togo, Niger, Mali, and Senegal. In addition to information campaigns for health workers, several countries have set up toll-free numbers for the population. In Senegal, the Ministry of Health and Social Action has recommended ‚Äúgoing to the nearest health facility as soon as you have a sudden onset respiratory illness‚Äù or to call 800 00 50 50, a toll-free information number. The Togolese authorities invited anyone who has recently been in China to contact 22 22 20 73. The Ivorian Minister of Health ‚Äúinvited the population not to give in to panic and to call 143 (toll-free number) for any information‚Äù. Equatorial Guinea issued a statement on 27 January about the impact that this epidemic could have on the oil market. The day before, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud, Saudi Energy Minister, expressed ‚Äúconfidence in the ability of the Chinese authorities to contain and eradicate the new coronavirus‚Äù, while adding that the Kingdom would be ready to react in case of ‚Äúpsychological factors affecting oil prices‚Äù. Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons in Equatorial Guinea, said, ‚ÄúAs a member of OPEC, Equatorial Guinea adheres to the declaration of Saudi Arabia and is fully prepared to engage in coordination action with the organisation if future developments of the coronavirus were to affect the stability of the world oil market.‚Äù Rabat announced Saturday the establishment of ‚Äúa crisis cell for the benefit of members of the Moroccan community established in China, to monitor their situation‚Äù. Dozens of students from the Kingdom are indeed quarantined in the city of Wuhan. For the time being, the WHO has not declared the disease as a public health emergency of international scope. According to Talisuna, the mortality rate ‚Äî about 4% ‚Äî remains low. ‚ÄúMany of the dead were over 50 years old, or already had other diseases,‚Äù he said. The disease manifests itself in flu-like symptoms that can lead to severe respiratory syndromes. ‚ÄúThe uniqueness of this virus is that it is a new strain that is still being studied,‚Äù said Talisuna. ‚ÄúFor now, the treatment is to treat the symptoms.‚Äù The WHO has provided a list of qualified laboratories around the world. According to Talisuna, the only laboratory on the continent capable of confirming coronavirus cases is in South Africa. The international organization has also issued a list of recommendations for populations to protect themselves from the virus. Among these are basic hand and respiratory hygiene, ‚Äúby adopting healthy eating practices and avoiding close contact with people with symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing, if possible‚Äù.

Charity Adams Earley was born in a segregated United States. This did not stop her from becoming the highest-ranked female, black officer in the army during World War II. Her mantra: ‚ÄúI just wanted to do my job.‚Äù When Charity Edna Adams was born on Dec. 5, 1918 in Kittrell, North Carolina, the United States was still celebrating its recent victory in the First World War. Despite the jubilation and the hope of the end of war forever, African Americans like Adams had dim prospects. The country was still heavily segregated, and racial discrimination was integrated into all aspects of American life. But Adams‚Äô parents hardly accepted the system as it stood. Her father, Eugene, was an episcopal minister who was fluent in Hebrew and Greek. Her mother, also named Charity, was a schoolteacher. U.S. ArmyCharity Adams with a fellow member of the WAC. In one instance, captured in Adams‚Äôs memoir, One Woman‚Äôs Army, Eugene cancelled a health insurance policy he took out for his daughter because the insurance agent refused to call her ‚ÄúMiss‚Äù since she was ‚Äúcolored.‚Äù In another example, a vegetable vendor called Adams‚Äô father ‚ÄúUncle,‚Äù a discriminatory term for black males during the segregated Jim Crow era. To this Eugene replied, ‚ÄúFine. And how is your mother, my sister?‚Äù This shut the merchant down completely. Eugene Adams would later become president of the local NAACP chapter in Columbia, South Carolina, where Adams spent most of her childhood. Charity Adams graduated valedictorian of her high school class with perfect attendance; she was two years younger than most of her classmates, as she started elementary school as a second grader. She had access to scholarships and chose Wilberforce University, a black college in Ohio. After graduating in 1938 with majors in physics, mathematics, and Latin, and a minor in history, she returned to South Carolina to teach while she attended graduate school at Ohio State University during the summers. Then the U.S. entered World War II. Wikimedia CommonsCharity Adams taking her oath as an officer in the U.S. Army. In 1942, Adams received a letter stating that the dean of Wilberforce University recommended her for the first class of the Women‚Äôs Army Auxiliary Corps, later known as the Women‚Äôs Army Corps (WAC). She decided that this was an outstanding opportunity for her with career and leadership potential. She applied that June, but when she didn‚Äôt receive an immediate response she forgot about it. She was on a bus to Ohio State to continue her graduate studies when she was summoned to the U.S. Army. After going through the interview and application process, she joined the WAC in July, one of only 39 black women in the corps‚Äô first training class. Although Adams bonded with her fellow recruits ‚Äì black and white ‚Äî on the train to her station in Iowa‚Äôs Fort Des Moines, in her words, ‚Äúthe Army soon shattered whatever closeness we had felt.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen we left the mess hall we were marched two-by-two‚Äôs to the reception center. A young, red-haired second lieutenant said, ‚ÄòWill all the colored girls move over on this side.‚Äô He pointed to an isolated group of seats. There was a moment of stunned silence, for even in the United States of the 40‚Äôs it did not occur to us that this could happen. The integration of our trip did not prepare us for this. What made things worse was that even after the ‚Äòcolored girls‚Äô had been pushed to the side, all the rest of the women were called by name to join a group to be led to their quarters. Why could not the ‚Äòcolored girls‚Äô be called by name to go to their quarters rather than be isolated by race?‚Äù In another instance, Adams was denied a seat in a dining car because of her race. The black waiters all put down their trays and refused to work. She was seated. Wikimedia CommonsCharity Adams leads her troops during World War II. Adams also was questioned for her race by a colonel and asked to show identification by MPs who were told to check her out, not believing a black woman could be an officer (she was one of Fort Des Moines‚Äô first black officers, and in September 1943 she was promoted to major). Adams‚Äô backbone was best displayed when an Army general inspected her unit. Not all of her personnel were available to line up, as many of them were working and others were sleeping. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit,‚Äù he told her, to which Adams replied, ‚ÄúOver my dead body, sir.‚Äù The general threatened to court martial Adams and she countered with a charge that the general was violating an Allied directive to refrain from using segregationist language. The general backed down. U.S. Army.Charity Adams and some of her subordinates. At the end of 1944, Adams received her first overseas assignment as the commanding officer of the first ‚Äî and only ‚Äî battalion of black WAC‚Äôs to head to Europe. Their first stop was Birmingham, England, where she worked and mingled with people of all races. She even dated a white British man several times ‚Äî something that would have been unheard of in the Jim Crow South. U.S. ArmyCharity Adams with staff members during World War II. Adams commanded the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, leading 850 African American female personnel in Birmingham. This unit was responsible for sorting and delivering months worth of backlogged mail for some 7 million American troops in stationed in the European theater. The monumental importance of letters from home to soldiers‚Äô morale cannot be understated. The assignment was also tricky since her unit was responsible for censoring mail that might have sensitive war information. Given six months to sort the mail, Adams split her battalion into three groups, each assigned an eight-hour shift. They worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and accomplished their task in only three months ‚Äî half the allotted time. From England the battalion moved to Rouen and Paris, France, where they continued to sort backlogged mail ‚Äî about 65,000 letters every day, by Adams‚Äô estimation. Not only did Adams make sure American soldiers received their morale-boosters, she looked after the morale of her own personnel as well. When she discovered that the Army hadn‚Äôt set aside funds for beauty equipment for its female officers, she went to work. ‚ÄúSolving this problem,‚Äù she later wrote, ‚ÄúI learned that if you ask the same question of enough people enough times, you can get the necessary information.‚Äù And she got what she asked for. Wikimedia CommonsCharity Adams inspecting WAC troops of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion Adams stayed with the army after the war‚Äôs end, but opted to leave the service shortly after receiving a promotion to lieutenant colonel. She was the highest-ranking black female officer in the American service. The National Council of Negro Women named her Woman of the Year in 1946. U.S. ArmyA mail unit during World War II. Adams returned to Ohio State and completed her masters degree in vocational psychology. She then served in academia and married Stanley A. Earley, Jr., a medical student, in 1949. The pair moved to Zurich, Switzerland for two years while he finished his studies, and they ultimately settled in Dayton, Ohio and had two children. She became a dean at Tennessee A&I College and Georgia State College, and served on the boards of many community organizations. She founded the Black Leadership Development Program in Dayton in 1982, educating and training African Americans to be leaders in their communities.  For her groundbreaking career Charity Adams Earley has been recognized by the National Women‚Äôs History Museum and the Smithsonian National Postal Museum.

The 51-mile trail would show the migration route used by newly freed slaves and other people of African descent in the 19th century. It‚Äôs based on the research of Naomi Mitchell Carrier, the founder of the Texas Center for African American Living History in Houston. ‚ÄúI was able to outline some 40 or more sites that have historical markers between Reedy Chapel in Galveston and Freedmen‚Äôs Town in Houston,‚Äù said Mitchell Carrier. ‚ÄúThat is the trail.‚Äù The route would include Independence Heights, Freedmen‚Äôs Town and Emancipation Park in Houston. It would also include the site of Galveston‚Äôs Osterman building, where a Union Army General told the people of Galveston that all slaves were free. ‚ÄúWhen Major General [Gordon] Granger arrived in Galveston with news that all slaves were free, he changed countless lives as well as the course of history,‚Äù Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement. ‚ÄúBy commemorating the trek so many families took to spread the great news, we can honor those families and celebrate the freedom we cherish as Texans and Americans.‚Äù The Texas Republican and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, sponsored the legislation calling for the study of the trail. It passed the U.S. Senate Monday, and was previously approved by the House in May. ‚ÄúThe historic passage of the Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act by the Senate will result in only the second trail in the United States that chronicles the experience of African Americans,‚Äù Jackson Lee said in a press release. According to Jackson Lee, there‚Äôs only one other trail of its kind that focuses on African Americans and their experiences: the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail. That heritage tourism attraction generates millions of dollars, which Jackson Lee said could also happen in Texas. ‚ÄúIn addition to preserving this important heritage, the Emancipation National Historic Trail is estimated to generate millions of dollars and hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs for the Texas region‚Äôs economy,‚Äù she said. Overall, Mitchell Carrier said creating the trail is a must for Texas and its African American history. ‚ÄúAnd, this history has either been wiped from memory or prohibited from memory,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe National Historical Emancipation Trail is about a restoration, resurrection, and ascension of historical memory.‚Äù  ","none","none",0,0,1,1

In putting together this list and its rankings, I took a look at quantity, critical acclaimed films and cultural impact (i.e films that moved the culture). Not to take anything away from other well known directors such as Spike Lee, the late John Singleton, Gina Prince-Bythewood, George Tillman Jr., and Lee Daniels, they have spent the last decade working on bringing exciting subjects to the small scene. 1.Ryan Coogler Coogler has emerged as the most prominent director with just three films. With Fruitvale Station, he won the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He then co-wrote and directed the seventh film in the Rocky series, Creed. That grossed nearly $175M worldwide and then he helmed Marvel‚Äôs Black Panther, which not only broke numerous box office records, but also became the highest-grossing film of all time by a black director. 2. Tyler Perry When the decade started, there was no consistent director making films and bringing in big box office receipts other than Tyler Perry. Love them or hate them, his films brought in an audience that no box office expert had seen before. Led by his signature character, Madea, folks couldn‚Äôt get enough laughs. He‚Äôs one of the few directors who also writes and produces his projects, which brings in average gross of at least $60M and generates a 2-1 return on his investment. 3. Jordan Peele With just 2 films to his directing credits, Jordan Peele has catapulted himself among this list. His feature film debut, Get Out, shook the world when it came out in 2017. A $4M budget for a horror film that starred relatively unknowns (Daniel Kaluyya, Alison Williams) in, the film grossed a whopping $280m worldwide and a became a cultural phenomenon. For his follow up Us, it became the highest grossing original film in 2019. 4. Steve McQueen McQueen had three films in this decade (Shame, 12 Years a Slave, and Widows) but it was 12 Years a Slave that made him the first Black director to have a film win Best Picture. McQueen makes gritty stories that are very in your face and very revealing in the character study. The public can see the soul of the character through the eyes of his lead actors/ actresses. 5. Barry Jenkins It had been over a decade when Jenkins had released his first film, Medicine for Melancholy, to critical acclaim. There was great anticipation for his next film Moonlight and when it came out in 2016, it not only captured everyone‚Äôs attention, but went on the win the Academy Award for Best Picture. This was the first time a film with an all-Black cast took such an honor and he also won an original screenplay Oscar. His next film, ‚ÄúIf Beale Street Could Talk‚Äù also garnered critical acclaim. 6. Ava DuVernay In this decade, DuVernay reinvented herself from film publicist to film director and she got her big break when she won the directing award in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival for her second feature film Middle of Nowhere, becoming the first black woman to win the award. Her second film, Selma, garnered her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director, and she also the first black female director to have her film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2017, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for her film 13th. In 2018, her film A Wrinkle in Time grossed over $100M at the box office, making her the first black female director to have that distinction. 7. F. Gary Gray F. Gary Gray had been relatively quiet in the beginning of the decade until he came back to the director‚Äôs chair with the NWA film Straight Outta Compton in 2015. Featuring mostly newcomers as part of the cast, this musical film did very well critically and financially. It not stood atop at the box office for 4 straight weeks, but it also grossed over $160M. Gray then went to direct the eighth installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise, The Fate of the Furious in 2017. With a total gross of $1.2B, it became the 18th highest-grossing film of all-time. With his last film being 2019‚Äôs Men in Black International, Gray is one of the few Black directors getting films with a $100M plus budget. 8. Antoine Fuqua Fuqua has been a muscular filmmaker who does action packed films that have been successful at the box office, includingThe Equalizer franchise with Denzel Washington doing his first sequel. Having done Southpaw and The Magnificent Seven remake to critical and financial success, let‚Äôs not forget that his direction of Olympus Has Fallen sparked two more sequels. 9. Tim Story Story is probably by quantity the most successful Black filmmaker when you throw in the Fantastic Fours from the previous decade to his successful run with the Think Like a Man and Ride Along franchises. One can say he‚Äôs a chameleon filmmaker who shows his versatility whether it‚Äôs action packed or comedy driven. He can work and do well in both fields. 10. Malcolm D. Lee Having worked over 15 years in the business, Lee finally gave us the sequel to his film debut Best Man with Best Man Holiday and it proved well at the box office, and then hit a home run with Girls Trip, which is one of the funniest Black films of the decade and introduced us to rising star Tiffany Haddish.

Anglophone ECOWAS members have criticized plans by the bloc's French-speaking states to change the CFA franc's name to 'Eco'. ECOWAS had planned to launch a common currency under the same name in 2020.   English-speaking members of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), plus Guinea, on Thursday condemned a recent announcement that the French-backed CFA franc used in eight West African countries would be renamed as the Eco. The move ""is not in line"" with plans by the regional bloc to adopt a single currency also called the Eco, they said in a statement issued after talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. In late December 2019, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara announced that the West African CFA franc, used by the former French colonies of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo, as well as by Guinea-Bissau, would be retired sometime in 2020 and replaced with a new currency ‚Äì called the Eco. ECOWAS member's Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone have their own currencies The Francophone Eco, like the outgoing CFA, will be pegged to the euro. It will eliminate the requirement for members to lodge half of their reserves in the French treasury. France will also quit the currency's managerial institutions. Ouattara's announcement came as a surprise to the six mainly Anglophone ECOWAS members who don't use the CFA franc. This is because back in June 2019, ECOWAS leaders had formally decided at a summit that the region's planned common currency should be called Eco ‚Äî the same name as the CFA zone group now plans to adopt. In a statement following Thursday's meeting, Nigerian Finance Minster Zainab Ahmed said the December announcement was ""inconsistent with the decision of the Authority of the Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS for the adoption of the Eco as the name of an independent ECOWAS single currency."" CFA franc hugely unpopular The CFA Franc, first introduced by France in 1945, has long been attacked as a colonial relic, triggering protests in countries such as Senegal and Ivory Coast. At this rally in Senegal in 2017, protesters called for an end to the CFA franc ""There has been a lot of pressure in these Francophone countries to reduce France's influence,"" said Tokunbo Afikuyomi, chief editor of the Nigerian business publication, Stears. ""So they have now decided that they need to act quickly and form a new arrangement for a new currency."" With Ivory Coast and Togo facing presidential elections in 2020, and Burkina Faso and Niger parliamentary elections, the announcement of the CFA franc's demise could be seen as an electorate pleaser, the economics expert said. The problem, Afikuyomi said, is that ECOWAS as a block wasn't moving fast enough to bring in its own regional currency that could potentially have replaced the CFA franc. ""What [the Francophone countries] have done has kind of blind-sided the rest of the ECOWAS group. They have almost taken it upon themselves to push ahead with the Eco plan."" 'Interesting timing' Afikuyomi also called the timing of the announcement ""politically and economically interesting"" considering the tensions between Nigeria and its neighbors, which include Francophone Benin and Niger, following Nigeria's decision to close its borders as of August 2019. ""Nigeria is trying to exclude everyone else with its protectionist policies, so it could be that [the Francophone countries] are thinking: 'Now, let's do something else that excludes Nigeria.' That is also coming into play,"" he said. ECOWAS countries not ready The idea of a common currency for the West African region was first mooted almost 30 years ago in the hope of boosting cross border trade and economic development. Its introduction has been postponed several times. In 2019, ECOWAS set a new target of 2020 for the single currency; most analysts, however, see this as highly unlikely. Currently, only Togo and Conakry Guinea met the criteria for joining the ECOWAS-planned currency, according to Nigerian economist, Akpan Ekpo ""But you cannot have a monetary union with these two small economies,"" he said in a written statement to DW, adding that Nigeria, West Africa's biggest economy, and other countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal must be part of the union for it to succeed. Nigeria makes up about two-thirds of West Africa's GDP, complicating the push for a common currency Nigeria, however, has been struggling economically. While Ghana is enjoying some economic stability, its debt has surged massively in the past few years meaning won't meet the criteria any time soon. Meanwhile, the economy of the Ivory Coast is booming, but it's facing political instability ahead of the October elections. ""This all needs to be dealt with before [ECOWAS] can move forward,"" said Ghanaian economist Kwame Pianim on the phone from Accra. Sola Jaiyesimi in Abuja contributed to this report. Brian Otieno's photo ""Dancing in the Streets"" is part of his ""Kibera Stories"" series, which reveal a different, poetic and beautiful side of daily life in Kibera, the largest slum in Nairobi, located in the southwestern part of the capital. Life there is particularly difficult for girls, who are often the victims of attacks. Otieno's picture shows a passionate 16-year-old dancer called Elsie. Groomsmen driving brides down a dirt road on a motorcycle: Freelance photographer Ley Uwera discovered the procession in Beni, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her photograph ""Motorcycle Marriage"" can be found on Instagram; Uwera has also published her works in international magazines. Mustafa Saeed lives and works in Hargeisa, Somalia. His photo shows Mahad (left) and Mohamed (right) competing against each other during the final of the Somaliland Chess Federation's championship. Mahad ended up winning. Sam Vox documents everyday life in Tanzania. He says he aims to share ""stories about people, places and their various cultures and traditions."" Vox has worked with organizations such as Water Aid and Everyday Education. ""We are made of salt water, so pure and so calm like the evening sea,"" he's written about his mysterious pictures of water. Edward Echwalu discovered tomorrow's cinema stars in a slum in Uganda's Kampala. He is proud to be part of ""Everyday Africa"": ""Never in the history of Africa has there been a period where the most photographed and shared photos are not about wars, poverty, diseases, but about everyday life on the continent, and most importantly, these stories are told by Africans,"" he wrote on Instagram. Nigerian photographer Yagazie Emez boasts a community numbering more than 140,000 followers on Instagram. Her pictures often tell stories about African women, and also about their hairstyles. For her work, Emezi travels through Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Gabon, Liberia and Uganda. Tom Saater is a documentary photographer and filmmaker from Nigeria. His work has been shown in countries around the world, including at Venice's famous Biennale. This photo shows a prospective lawyer on the way to her exam in Abuja, Nigeria. Like all the ""Everyday Africa"" photographers, Saater wants to show normal life in Africa, a perspective that is seldom seen in Western media. Rather than standing in line in front of banks or gas stations as many people do in Zimbabwe, these young people are enjoying their lives. The group called ""Material Culture"" consists of young residents of various townships in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city. That is also where photographer Zinyange Auntony works and resides. Maheder Haileselassie took this picture of a man who is forging his way through water hyacinths. The flowers multiply rapidly, disrupting the biodiversity of the water, such as in Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Documenting environmental changes in her home country is an urgent endeavor of the photographer based in Adis Abeba. Ghanaian Nana Kofi Acquah travels across the continent for his work. His picture ""Shaking Hands"" was taken in Tanghin-Dassouri, Burkina Faso. Short walks can take a long time, the photographer noted, since one greets everyone one runs into. People don't say ""hi"" or ""good morning,"" but ask, ""how is your spouse, your kids, your business or your health?"" And they listen to each response, he said.

The boys taunted them, calling them ‚Äúslave‚Äù and other slurs. Then they tried to rip off Ekhlas‚Äô clothes. An onlooker intervened, scolding the young harassers, and the sisters and their three children managed to escape. But they were shaken. They had just arrived in Cairo months earlier, fleeing violence in their homeland. The harassment brought up traumatic memories of detention, torture and rape they said they experienced at the hands of militias in Sudan‚Äôs Nuba mountains. ‚ÄúWe have come here seeking safety,‚Äù said Ekhlas, recounting the incident that took place in November. ‚ÄúBut the reality was very different.‚Äù Egypt has for decades been a refuge for sub-Saharan African migrants trying to escape war or poverty. But the streets of Cairo, a metropolis of some 20 million, can bring new dangers in the form of racist harassment or even violence in ways that other significant migrant communities here, such as Libyans and Syrians, don‚Äôt face. While other major centers of African migration like Europe have been wrestling with racist violence, Egypt has only made small starts toward addressing the issue. The U.N.‚Äôs International Organization for Migration says Egypt hosts more than 6 million migrants, more than half of them from Sudan and South Sudan, where simmering conflicts continue to displace tens of thousands of people annually. For some, Egypt is a destination and a haven, the closest and easiest country for them to enter. For others, it is a point of transit before attempting the dangerous Mediterranean crossing to Europe. In visits to several migrant communities throughout Cairo, at least two dozen sub-Saharan Africans, including four children, told The Associated Press that they have endured racist insults, sexual harassment or other abuses in the past three months. The children said they have had rocks and trash thrown at them as they go to or from school. One woman from Ethiopia said neighbors pound on the windows of her family‚Äôs home, yelling ‚Äúslaves‚Äù before disappearing into the night. There are signs that Egypt is starting to recognize and censure racist crimes. In November, there was a public outcry over a video that went viral showing three Egyptian teenagers bullying a schoolboy from South Sudan. In the video, taken by mobile phone, the teenagers block the boy‚Äôs way, laughing and making fun of his appearance before trying to take his backpack. In the aftermath, police detained the teenagers for a day before their families reached a settlement with the family of the South Sudanese boy, John Manuth. Weeks later, Egypt‚Äôs President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi hosted Manuth at a youth forum in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and made a rare high-level acknowledgement of the problem. ‚ÄúThey are our guests and negative treatment is not acceptable and not allowed,‚Äù el-Sissi told the audience. In 2018, a court sentenced to seven years in prison a man who was known to harass refugees and who beat to death a South Sudanese teacher who had worked in a community-run school for refugees in Cairo. Refugees and rights workers say the country still has a long way to go. Reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence against migrants has increased in recent months, according to the IOM. Women and girls are the most effected, but so are vulnerable men and young boys, said Shirley De Leon, a project development officer at the organization. She said that could in part be because of Egypt‚Äôs economic strains ‚Äî ‚Äúchallenges remain and are exacerbated by inflation, eroded income and high youth unemployment.‚Äù Most migrants live in crowded poorer neighborhoods, where they form insular communities in small, packed apartment buildings. The idea is to protect families and vulnerable new arrivals from abuses. Racism has roots in Egyptian society. For centuries, Egypt was colonized by Arab, Turkish and European imperial powers. Lighter skin was identified with the elite. Darker-complexioned Egyptians and sub-Saharan Africans have been portrayed as doormen, waiters, and cleaners in films for decades. Some Egyptians still unabashedly address people by their skin color, calling them ‚Äúblack,‚Äù ‚Äúdark,‚Äù or ‚Äúchocolate.‚Äù Historically, many have preferred to think of themselves as Arab, rather than African. Attia Essawi, an expert on African affairs at Cairo‚Äôs al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, says it will take a lot to break some societal beliefs. ‚ÄúAuthorities should be decisive, with more severe measures against racism and bullying,‚Äù he said. But for many, reporting a crime is not an option. Two South Sudanese women, who work as part-time house cleaners, told the AP they had been sexually assaulted by their employers. Neither of them reported the allegations to police, as one of them has not finalized her documents as a migrant in Egypt and the other feared reprisals from her attacker. For the same reasons, they spoke on condition of anonymity. Now, they and others say they make sure to be home by nightfall, and only go out in groups. El-Sissi has said in the past that his country doesn‚Äôt need camps for refugees, because it is welcoming and absorbs them so readily. Many sub-Saharan African migrants enter the country legally but overstay visas. Enforcement on those who stay illegally is lax, and a large number of them work in the huge informal economy as street vendors and house cleaners. In a caf√© frequented by migrants in a central Cairo neighborhood, Ethiopian refugee Ahmed el-Athiopi says that he came to the city five years ago to escape repression at home. He believes the only reason he has been able to keep a job is because he makes half that of an Egyptian. For now, though, he says Cairo remains his best available option. ‚ÄúI hope things get better in the future. Here is much better than in my home country as there is likely a zero chance to leave for Europe,‚Äù he said.","none","none",1,1,1,1

"65",887,"https://www.pulse.ng/sports/football/pulse-list-2019-best-african-xi-of-the-year/l46r5ky","Pulse List 2019: Best African XI of the year","Authors: As we count down to the end of 2019, we are looking at the best African players in each position of the field. From the Premier League to the Champions League and the major clubs around the world, African players had key roles in some of the most successful teams in the world. This players in this XI are not here just for their club performances. In a year where we had the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), national team impact was also considered. These are the best African players in every position in the last 12 months. Andre Onana established himself as the best goalkeeper from the continent mostly with his performances for Ajax. Since he came through the ranks to become Ajax‚Äôs first-choice goalkeeper, it was in 2019 that he repaid the club‚Äôs faith in him when almost everyone was in doubt. It was in 2019 that he completed the 2018/2019 season where he won the league and cup double for Ajax. In the league, he had 15 clean sheets in 33 games with an impressive 2.4 saves per game. He was also played all the games in Ajax‚Äôs run to the Champions League semifinal. Onana wasn‚Äôt that impressive at AFCON 2019 but played in all Cameroon‚Äôs four games in Egypt. Youssouf Sabaly comes in this XI due to his fantastic performance for Senegal at AFCON 2019. Although a right-back, Sabaly played the left-back role for the beaten finalists of AFCON 2019 with solidity and efficiently. For his effort, he was including the official XI of the tournament. It's for this reason that he makes this XI and the fact that we don‚Äôt consider any other fullback worthy. In 2019, Koulibaly continued to make his mark as one of the best defenders in world football. It was a reputation fueled by his consistent performance for Napoli. Big, strong, a good reader of the game with good feet on the ball, Koulibaly headed to AFCON 2019 with so much expected of him. He did not disappoint as led the best defence at the tournament to the final. Joel Matip had a fantastic year helping Liverpool to the Champions League title. The Cameroonian played eight games in that Champions League campaign including the semifinals and the final as Liverpool won the title. This season Matip has started 17 times in his 22 appearances for Liverpool who are still unbeaten in the Premier League. One of the most exciting young talents in world football, Hakimi‚Äôs stock continued to rise due to his impressive performances in 2019. Hakimi who is halfway into his second season at Dortmund was a key member of the BVB side that finished Bundesliga runners-up in 2018/19. Hakimi played 21 times with two goals and assists to help Dortmund to a second-place finish. This season, the 21-year-old has already featured in 26 matches in all competitions, registering six goals and as many assists. He had his first career brace in Dortmund's 2-0 win at Slavia Prague in UEFA Champions League Group F and scored another double to help BVB to a stunning comeback from 2-0 down in a 3-2 home win over Inter Milan. The Real Madrid loanee is so far the highest-scoring defender in the Champions League this season. He was part of the Moroccan squad who had a disappointing AFCON 2019 campaign but this does not take away from everything he achieved in 2019. At the beginning of 2019 which was midway into the 2018./2019 season, Bennacer was already getting his plaudits for his performances for Empoli. A midfield player with a fine reading of the game and solidity and energy to defend spaces in the middle, the 22-year-old was catching the eye at Empoli. It was at AFCON 2019 that the Algerian exploded. Playing as the right central-midfielder in a 4-3-3 formation, he was Algeria's best player as they went on to win the title. He was also named Player of the Tournament for his effort. Africa has some solid names in this position. Wilfred Ndidi, Thomas Partey and Idrissa Gueye are some big names in this midfield position. But while Ndidi and Party did not win any silverware and failed at AFCON 2019, Gueye was bested in the final of AFCON 2019 by Bennacer which gave him an edge to make this XI. Hakim Ziyech was part of the Ajax team that caught the world‚Äôs attention in 2019. He scored 16 goals and made 13 assists in the league to help his side to the title and also impressed in the Champions League with three goals and three assists as Ajax reached the semi-finals. He was one of the players to watch at AFCON 2019 but he failed to lift Morocco who disappointed with a second-round exit. Ziyech was particularly at fault for that exit as he missed a couple of fine chances in that second-round game against the Republic of Benin but he had such a good year with Ajax. Mahrez didn‚Äôt have a great start to 2019 as he struggled to make an impact at Manchester City. He did manage seven goals in 27 games (14 starts) as Manchester City won the Premier League title and another two goals in five games to help his side to the FA Cup title. He ended that season with a domestic treble with Manchester City although he didn't make much impact. It‚Äôs this season that he has looked like the player he was at Leicester City and has become more important to Manchester City. He has five goals and five assists in 19 league games (10 starts), one goal and four assists in five Champions League games. It was his performance at AFCON 2019 that however stands him out as one of the best players in the continent. He played all Algeria‚Äôs games at AFCON 2019 and scored three goals including the important last-minute winner against Nigeria in the semifinals. Salah continued his incredible return of goals for Liverpool who won the Champions League title in 2019. In that campaign, Salah played 12 games and scored five goals including Liverpool‚Äôs opener in the 2-0 win over Tottenham in the final. In the Premier League, he got the Golden Boot alongside two other African players Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Sadio Mane. With the weight of expectation for the host of AFCON 2019, Egypt, Salah and the Pharaohs collapsed in the quarterfinals which put a huge dent on his 2019. He has since bounced back to help Liverpool unbeaten run so far in the Premier League this season. Mane in 2019 finally stepped out of the Salah shadows to insert himself in the conversations for the best players in world football. He also scored 22 goals to pick up the Premier League Golden Boot and got four goals in that Liverpool‚Äôs victorious Champions League campaign. He delivered to expectations at AFCON 2019 where he scored three goals and helped Senegal to the final where they lost to Algeria. This season, he has continued from where he stopped with 10 league goals and two in the Champions League. No player scored more Premier League goals than Aubameyang in 2019 as he picked up the Golden Boot of the 2018/2019 season. He also fired Arsenal to the finals of the Europa League. This season, he has continued with his hot streak with 13 goals in the Premier League. He wasn‚Äôt in action at AFCON 2019 but he displaces Nigeria‚Äôs Odion Ighalo who finished as the highest goalscorer at both the qualifiers and the main tournament of AFCON 2019.

She grew up on the classic animated films, the memorable characters, and the inspiring storylines. But it wasn't until years later that her fondness would blossom into an obsession, one that inspired her to found a DisneyBound community and visit the theme parks regularly. Flash forward five years, and her sense of community and creativity would extend to a group of women set on changing the way we see Disney princesses. Thus, AfricanPRINTcesses became a reality. I first saw Audrey when she and her fellow royals popped up on my Instagram explore feed. Fourteen women, 14 outfits, 14 new ways of looking at princesses, from Snow White to Vanellope. Over email, Audrey told POPSUGAR she'd been trying to get this idea off the ground for a number of years. ""It was important to see this through because when I came up with the idea, it was literally because our group had run out of black women Disney characters to portray,"" she explained. ""After only TWO projects we had depleted the extent of black female Disney characters (the Muses and Princess Tiana). I said, 'Well if there aren't any more black Disney girls, let's make the Disney girls black.'"" Audrey played around with the idea starting in 2017, but busy schedules and other projects kept it from becoming a reality. Looking back, she thinks this hold-up might have been serendipitous since she had the chance to meet so many other Black women in the DisneyBounding community over the past three years. The group came together (mostly via Instagram), picked their princesses, brainstormed outfits using traditional African prints and fabrics, then decided to plan the big reveal around Black History Month because ""it would make a bigger impact and really showcase the point of the idea."" On Feb. 8, the group ‚Äî along with photographer Madeline Barr ‚Äî made their debut, delighting cast members and guests at Disneyland. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Chip, and Dale all stopped for a little time with the princesses. People asked to take their photo. ""At one point we finally had to leave Main Street because there were a lot of people staring and pointing as photos were being taken,"" Audrey said. ""All day guests were commenting on how beautiful and majestic we looked."" Much like how Disney is a beacon to both children and adults alike, I imagine Audrey and her fellow ""PRINTcesses"" will shine as an example to all ages, but especially young women of color. ""For all the little girls out there who still don't see the representation they deserve or who are still told that their black/brown skin and kinky hair are undesirable, you are beautiful princesses. The standard of beauty is YOU! You can be a mermaid, you can be a boss lady, you can be a warrior, you can be an adventurer,"" Audrey said.

The airstrike took place in Jilib, Somalia, and did not result in any troops or civilians injured, according to an AFRICOM statement. ‚ÄúOur persistent actions against al-Shabaab ensures constant and continued pressure on this malign network,‚Äù said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Miguel Castellanos, U.S. Africa Command deputy director of operations. ‚ÄúOur collective efforts help enhance security in the region and put al-Shabaab on notice, making both Somalia and the U.S. safer in the process,‚Äù Castellanos added. The strike is the ninth conducted by AFRICOM against Al-Shabaab in February alone. The nine strikes have collectively killed 11 Al-Shabaab terrorists and wounded several others, in addition to damaging or destroying multiple terrorist compounds. The latest strike comes just one day after a precision airstrike on Sunday killed three Al-Shabaab terrorists and destroyed their compound in Dujuuma, Somalia. Also on Sunday, another airstrike in Saakow, Somalia killed two terrorists, wounded one, and destroyed a terrorist compound, AFRICOM said in a statement. ‚ÄúAl-Shabaab kills regularly and indiscriminately,‚Äù Brig. Gen. Castellanos said. ‚ÄúThis al-Qaida affiliate exploits innocent Somalis, displaces families, and imposes illegal taxes through force and violence. They want to export their vision of destruction more widely. It is our collective international efforts and persistent pressure that prevents this from occurring.‚Äù U.S. forces have been positioned in Africa for years, targeting both ISIS-Somalia terrorists and the Al-Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab terrorists. AFRICOM conducted more than 60 airstrikes in Somalia during 2019, setting a record. They previously conducted 47 airstrikes in 2018 and 35 in 2017. ‚ÄúSince al-Shabaab‚Äôs first external attack in 2010, the group has ruthlessly killed hundreds,‚Äù U.S. Army Maj. Gen. William Gayler, director of operations, U.S. Africa Command, said in a December 29 statement. ‚ÄúThey have attacked and killed African partners, allies, and fellow Americans. They are a global menace and their sights are set on exporting violence regionally and eventually attacking the U.S. homeland,‚Äù Gayler added.","none","none",0,0,0,0

During a brief discussion about Trump‚Äôs disgraceful State of the Union Address, Dobbs literally ignored all of the accomplishments several presidents have made to improve the lives of African Americans over the last 100 years to slather praise on Trump like a typical hype man. Needless to say, Trump liked what he heard so much that he directly quoted Dobbs on social media. ‚ÄúThis President has done more for African Americans in this Country than any President since Lincoln.‚Äù @LouDobbs ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2020  Trump posted the video, too. pic.twitter.com/9GEW2VZu5h ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2020  Again, Dobbs is flagrantly wrong as other presidents have done more for African Americans in this country than Trump ever will. For example, Harry Truman integrated the armed forces. John F. Kennedy enforced the desegregation of schools and supported what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a landmark law that Lyndon Johnson signed into law after Kennedy‚Äôs assassination. Johnson would go on to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Trump has not signed any legislation that rises to the level of those two historical pieces of legislation. Furthermore, Barack Obama was America‚Äôs first black president, who oversaw a significant drop in the black unemployment rate long before Trump ever took office. The poverty rate among African Americans dropped as well, and African American health and education improved. The incarceration rate fell and Obama appointed 62 black judges to lifetime appointments on the courts. He also proved to young black children across the country that skin color cannot prevent them from becoming president someday. Twitter users were not amused by Dobb‚Äôs proclamation. Donald Trump Loves ‚Äúthe blacks‚Äù pt 1 That time he refused to unequivocally denounce Nazis and White Supremacists. ‚ÄúVery Fine People‚Äùpic.twitter.com/bl0ElDTABZ ‚Äî Ryan Hill (@RyanHillMI) February 7, 2020  Donald Trump Loves ‚Äúthe blacks‚Äù pt 2 The time he called African Countries sh*tholes‚Ä¶.pic.twitter.com/Nl49hx4fHl ‚Äî Ryan Hill (@RyanHillMI) February 7, 2020  Lou Dobbs is an ignorant, sycophantic, derriere kissing, racist puppet, willing to say anything to curry favor with the Grand Wizard. https://t.co/n16U1V8nWM https://t.co/n16U1V8nWM ‚Äî Bishop Talbert Swan (@TalbertSwan) February 7, 2020  Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and helped free the African American slaves while Trump falsely accused the Central Park 5 of rape and paid the New York Times to publicly call for their brutal executions. Trump also falsely accused Obama of being born in Kenya. ‚Äî Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) February 7, 2020  Trump just gave medal of honor to Rush Limbaugh who said this about Blacks: ‚ÄúThe NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.‚Äù To a Black female caller: ‚ÄúTake that bone out of your nose and call me back‚Äù https://t.co/IdZ0kbXtq7 ‚Äî (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) February 7, 2020  https://t.co/M6KEAQ324r ‚Äî Debbie (@Debbie56111656) February 7, 2020  Trump and his supporters are desperate to convince black voters that he‚Äôs working for them. But the reality is that Trump only offers them crumbs while pandering to white supremacists. They say black people should be grateful and that they owe Trump something for the little he has done for them. It‚Äôs a racist trope that should not win Trump any points come November.

Akpa said it was very important that Nigeria should extend this technology to other African countries ‚Äúand I assure you that we will be happy to do that.‚Äô‚Äô The DG disclosed that the variety of bt cotton developed in Nigeria is between 4.2 to 4.5 tonnes per hectare. ‚ÄúIn fact somebody who is a very enlightened farmer got 5 tonnes per hectare and reported that during the last field day in the agency; so you can imagine the dramatic increase. ‚ÄúThe traditional variety gives you between 250 to 750 kilogram per hectare, that is less than one ton per hectare, so you can see the type of thing science can do,‚Äô‚Äô he said. He told the visitors that NABDA had ‚Äúalso done bt cowpea‚Äô‚Äô, and that Nigeria is the first country in the world to develop bt cowpea, an important protein source for low income earners. He disclosed that cowpea (beans) was naturally prone to insect pest attacks, not only in the store but also in the field. ‚ÄúIn the field there is a devastating pest called maruca which can eat up a 10 hectare farm in 10 days, which is a nightmare to farmers,‚Äô‚Äô the DG said. Akpa further disclosed that the bt cowpea developed in Nigeria was resistant to the insect pest, maruca. He said not only that, tiny weevils also tend to eat them up during storage, converting them to dust. He added that out of desperation, business people and even some farmers had tried to preserve beans in the store by using ‚Äúsniper, a very dangerous chemical‚Äô‚Äô. Akpa said although sniper was an effective pesticide, ‚Äúbut very dangerous, it kills humans‚Äô‚Äô. He said the good news was that ‚Äúwe do bio-fertilizer, bio-insecticide and also bio-fungicide.‚Äô‚Äô According to him, the bio-insecticide is effective in preserving beans in storage by destroying the tiny weevils that destroy these produce in storage. He hinted that the bio-insecticide was ‚Äútotally harmless to the environment and completely harmless to humans because they are normal microorganisms.‚Äô‚Äô The NABDA boss also spoke on what the agency had done on yam seedlings and what they were planning to do this 2020. He expressed appreciation over the visit of the youth federation, saying he was honoured for making him their patron. Earlier, Mr Kewul Suleh, from Ghana and president of the federation said he spoke on behalf of the entire officials serving in the 2018/2022 leadership of the federation. Suleh extolled the virtues of the DG and steadfastness on his firm principles. The visitors also extended an invitation to the DG on their upcoming World Youth Summit to be held in Accra, Ghana.

(WAFB) - There‚Äôs something truly special about Historically Black College and Universities, particularly Southern University in Baton Rouge. Over the last few years, these traditionally African American schools, or HBCUs, have been highlighted in music videos, documentaries, and parades all over the country. But beyond the glitz and glamour of the HBCU experience, there is a strong history rooted in the foundation and these great institutions. ‚ÄúSouthern‚Äôs birth came after reconstruction and was right after the Civil War when the South had to be rebuilt because of the devastating impact of the war. So, after the end of Reconstruction there was change taking place nationally, locally,‚Äù Dr. Charles Vincent, Southern University history professor told WAFB‚Äôs Donovan‚Äôs Jackson. There were many roadblocks ahead for African Americans in the south as they began working towards a better future. One of those blocks was limited access to education. ‚ÄúA better education meant a way of supporting their families, supporting their communities, and bringing the skills back that could improve their communities,‚Äù Vincent said. RELATED STORIES: State officials at the time like P.B.S Pinchback, Louisiana‚Äôs first black Governor, and state legislator T.T. Allain helped move the fight for a black university forward. ‚ÄúThey wanted something in law in the state constitution, in the state legislature acts, that would provide higher education for persons of color. Southern university emerged out of the constitution invention of 1879. It was charted by the legislature in 1880. It began classes shortly thereafter,‚Äù Vincent explained. This was the beginning of the Southern University System, made up of five schools. It is the only remaining HBCU system in the nation. The first campus opened in New Orleans. It was not until 1914 that the main campus opened its doors in Scotlandville. ‚ÄúThese institutions have been the bridges that have brought us over. Physicians and restaurant owners, there were business leaders and others who were touched by Southern University. Southern, as FG Clark said, he called it the Soul Mother. Some would argue it is the soul mother of the middle class,‚Äù Vincent said. For more than a century, Southern University and other HBCU‚Äôs have been the foundation for success for blacks in the United States. However, the HBCU experience is more than just schoolwork. From the football games to the band performances, to the dancing dolls there is always entertainment on campus. ""We were doing that years ago on the field with the marching 100, with the glamorous girls out front. Their names have changed; they probably weren‚Äôt the dancing dolls. They may have been the southern belles or the majorettes and things of that nature, but they have always been an aspect of the university. When looked at in terms of our talent, when looked at it in terms about contribution in culture and history. We have added something special to the mix,‚Äù Vincent said. Today, HBCU‚Äôs have become a major part of mainstream entertainment. They have garnered the attention of celebrities like Beyonc√©, the Jonas Brothers, Lizzo and many more. They have been included in national parades and sports halftime shows. ‚ÄúThese national exposures do wonders for their wanting to be part of the human jukebox and they‚Äôre wanting to come to Southern and experience what it‚Äôs like to be at an HBCU. It is great to see young students in the north and in the west to see us in a different light. Or indeed just to see us. That just shows you the seeds that were sewed are bearing fruit,‚Äù Vincent said. The HBCU experience...it‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt find anywhere else. Baton Rouge is lucky enough to have one of the greatest HBCU‚Äôs in the nation, Southern University. Copyright 2020 WAFB. All rights reserved.","none","none",0,0,1,2

Black. First.,‚Äù meet more than 50 African American women who changed the world Nadine Daher Reporter While other children were making mud pies, Augusta Fells Savage used the clay near her home to mold small figures of farm animals. It was obvious that Savage had a talent for sculpting. Despite her father‚Äôs objections, and the opportunities she was denied because of her race, Savage continued to practice her craft and in 1934, became the first African American artist to be elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. Savage‚Äôs work and spirit inspired many others to follow the trail she so bravely blazed. The walls of her studio in Harlem witnessed the early beginnings of several well-known artists like Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight, where she offered free classes and gallery space to her students. This story is only one of many featured in, Brave. Black. First. 50+ African American Women Who Changed the World. A collection of short biographies written by Cheryl Willis Hudson, and compiled in collaboration with the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of African American History and Culture, the book‚Äôs pages serve as testament to the impact women, and particularly women of color, have had and continue to have on the world. Although created for young readers, the masterful storytelling combined with Erin K. Robinson‚Äôs enchanting illustrations are sure to capture the attention of all generations. Kinshasha Holman Conwill, the museum‚Äôs deputy director, who lent her expertise to the selection process, hopes that the compendium incentivizes readers to take the next step, and perhaps be inspired to listen to the music of Nina Simone or to tackle Michelle Obama‚Äôs memoir Becoming. ‚ÄúThis book might strike a chord, it might make those who read it want to go further, and increase their knowledge,‚Äù says Conwill. Flipping the pages, one is struck by the authenticity and vibrancy of the illustrations. The pearls around Ella Fitzgerald‚Äôs neck glisten, the tennis ball flies from Serena Williams‚Äô racket, the purple of Dorothy Height‚Äôs hat pulses with pride and Angela Davis‚Äô fist is clenched in fierce defiance. ‚ÄúI really wanted my illustrations to feel tangible, to be textured and have emotion,‚Äù says Robinson. ‚ÄúI want the readers to feel that they knew these women, to feel intimate with them.‚Äù The narratives span a vast range of cultural landscapes. From music and sports to arts and activism, from protest to performance, each story hints at the many different methods and means that women access to find success, but when read as a whole, the tales reveal the profound commonality these women share. They are all brave, they are all black, and they are all the first to achieve groundbreaking success in their respective fields. Through its collaboration with the museum, the book works to pull these women from the pages and into real life. Many of the women featured are linked to artifacts held in the museum‚Äôs collections, which Hudson anticipates will demonstrate to the readers that history is prologue. ‚ÄúI think children, young adults, adults, people can see themselves as a part of history, rather than something that is stiff and, on the page,‚Äù explains Hudson. ‚ÄúI hope that children can go into the museum, and experience the history they read about in the book.‚Äù Conwill, emphasizes this sentiment, hoping the book is another method for sharing the museum‚Äôs vast collections. ‚ÄúLike the motto of the Smithsonian‚Äîthe increase and diffusion of knowledge‚Äîit makes people want to not only take this for what it is, but to move beyond it,‚Äù she says. Published in collaboration with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, discover more than 50 remarkable African American women whose unique skills and contributions paved the way for the next generation of young people. These 100 stunning postcards celebrate 50 groundbreaking African American women, from Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks to Angela Davis and Beyonc√©‚Äîpublished in collaboration with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.

According to the DA, train maintenance technicians and mechanics have to scratch in bins of used brake pads to find barely-usable spares to replace severely worn ones. The DA said it has seen pictures of badly-worn brake spares and the bins which technicians desperately had to salvage parts from to keep trains running. ‚ÄúThe practice of salvaging used spare parts to replace worn parts places the lives of the millions of South African rail commuters in unimaginable amounts of danger,‚Äù the DA said. It added that this practice will inevitably result in accidents, and worse fatalities, if not addressed immediately. The City Press reported that the shortage of brake blocks is only one of many problems facing the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). ‚ÄúThe rail utility is falling apart as it does not have oil to lubricate wheels, coach windows are missing, and wiring has been stolen,‚Äù the report said. A Prasa service provider told the City Press that the rail utility used to order 1,500 brake blocks a month. However, in the last six months, Prasa did not order any new brake blocks, which has clearly led to severe shortages. ‚ÄúIt is really a miracle that there has not been any train accident. Operating a train without brake blocks is like operating without a heart,‚Äù the supplier said. A Prasa technician added that most of Prasa‚Äôs trains were not rail-worthy because they did not have brakes within the wear limit or windows. The DA said it would write to Prasa and the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) to address the issue. It will request the organisations to make public plans on how they intend to address the lack of replacement brake blocks at Prasa‚Äôs maintenance facilities. ‚ÄúWe are of the view that it is in the public‚Äôs interest to know exactly how and when Prasa will restock its maintenance facilities with new replacement brake blocks,‚Äù the DA said. The DA said it will closely monitor and follow up on Prasa‚Äôs progress given the instruction by RSR and will welcome this step in an effort to keep our commuters safe.

University of Ottawa provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation CA-FR. University of Ottawa provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA. View all partners After students at a California high school were recently told to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù Black English phrases into standard English, a community member at a school board hearing said: ‚ÄúThe last thing they need ‚Äî our children ‚Äî is to be forced to attend class and to be mocked and bullied by students because of a lesson plan used to highlight African American Vernacular English.‚Äù Few dialects of English have garnered so much negative attention. From the classroom to the courtroom, the place of African American Vernacular English is hotly debated. This is because people associate it with linguistic features now denounced as grammatically incorrect, like ‚Äúdouble negatives‚Äù or verbs that don‚Äôt agree with their subjects. For example: You might as well not tell them, ‚Äòcause you ain‚Äôt getting no thanks for it. You might as well not tell them nothing about it, only just leave it in the hands of the Lord.  ‚ÄòCause I knows it and I sees it now.  Teachers and language mavens chalk these features up to ‚Äúbad‚Äù English. Some linguists contend that they‚Äôre not English, but rather the legacy of an English-based Creole once widespread across British North America. As a sociolinguist specializing in the structure of the spoken language, my team at the University of Ottawa Sociolinguistics Laboratory has been grappling with this issue for years. Our research shows that many of these stereotypical non-standard features are direct offshoots of an older stage of English ‚Äî that of the British who colonized the United States. To understand how African American Vernacular English got the way it is now, you have to know what it was like before. But historical evidence of an earlier stage is in short supply: recording technology is too recent, and written representations are both scarce and unreliable. To access early Black English, we first had to reconstruct it from the speech of the African American diaspora. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, thousands of formerly enslaved African Americans settled in small enclaves in Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Canada, where their descendants still reside. Geographically and socially isolated, the key characteristic of linguistic enclaves is that they preserve older features. Three such communities, never before studied in this connection, helped us shed light on the history of African American Vernacular English: Saman√°, a small peninsula in the northeastern Dominican Republic, and North Preston and Guysborough in Nova Scotia. Thanks to local residents, we were able to locate and record the oldest members of these communities. Saman√°, Dominican Republic  North Preston, Nova Scotia  Guysborough, Nova Scotia  We compared our recordings with others made nearly a century earlier with elderly African Americans born in slavery in the American South. These ‚ÄúEx-Slave Recordings‚Äù allowed us to validate the diaspora materials as an earlier stage. Ex-Slave Recordings  My team and I painstakingly analyzed these materials to detect statistically significant speech patterns, and compared them across different dialects of English. We also assembled nearly 100 grammars of English dating as far back as 1577. Such comparisons enable linguists to reconstruct linguistic ancestry; like evolutionary biologists, we seek shared retentions ‚Äî features that have stayed the same despite changes elsewhere. This revealed that many of the features stereotypically associated with contemporary African American Vernacular English have a robust precedent in the history of the English language. Consider the present tense. In standard English, only verbs in the third-person singular are inflected with ‚Äìs, as in ‚Äúhe/she/it understands.‚Äù In African American Vernacular English, on the other hand, not only does the verb sometimes remain bare in the third person (e.g. ‚ÄúHe understand what I say‚Äù), it may also feature ‚Äìs in other persons, as in, ‚ÄúThey always tries to be obedient.‚Äù Our research on old grammars taught us that the standard English requirement that subject and verb agree in the third-person singular is actually relatively recent. As far back as 1788, the grammarian James Beattie noted that a singular verb sometimes followed a plural noun ‚Äî exactly as we find in African American vernacular English today. To our surprise, quantitative analysis of the way speakers used the present tense in our early Black English database showed that they follow a pattern described by the grammarian James Murray in 1873: This pattern, known as the ‚Äúnorthern subject rule,‚Äù involves leaving the verb bare when the subject is an adjacent pronoun (‚ÄúThey come and take them‚Äù) and inflecting it with ‚Äìs otherwise (‚ÄúThe birds comes and pecks them‚Äù). A linguistic pattern as detailed as the northern subject rule could not have been innovated by members of these far-flung communities independently. Rather, our comparisons confirmed that it was inherited from a common source: the English language first learned by enslaved individuals in the U.S. colonies. In fact, the same pattern is heard in other varieties of English with no known African American input or ties, as in this example from Devon, in the United Kingdom: You go off for the day, and gives ‚Äòem fish and chips on the way home. This is far from an isolated example. When we repeated this exercise, we found a historical precedent for many other linguistic features that are today considered grammatically incorrect. Focusing on current differences between African American Vernacular English and standard English leads us down the garden path of concluding that it is ‚Äúbad‚Äù English. But when we factor in history and science, we learn that it retained structures that standard English has now stamped out. Our results show that many salient features of African American Vernacular English were not innovated, but are instead the legacy of an older stage of English. African American Vernacular English should rightly be legitimized as a conservative and not incorrect variety of English, one whose core grammatical difference is its resistance to mainstream change. They speak the same English. The English people talks with grammar.  That‚Äôs why, you know, they celebrate that day. Coloured folks celebrates that day.  Oh, I live my life. I and Emma, and Aunt Bridgie all ‚Äî we all lives our life.  He know the first snowfall, he know the first guys that shoots the deer and everything.

(AP/WSVN) ‚Äî A private archaeology firm says it has discovered what appear to be about 44 graves from a long-forgotten African American cemetery under a Florida parking lot. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the firm, Cardno, used ground-penetrating radar to find the suspected graves. The firm was hired by the city of Clearwater and the Pinellas County School Board to conduct the search. The school district owns the parking lot. Cardno also reported additional graves may exist under a nearby school district building. According to Fox 13, the graves were found underneath a former elementary school. The discovery is the third since August in which archaeologists have discovered lost African American graves in the Tampa Bay region. In the latest find, officials say the original cemetery was moved in 1954 but that some graves were left behind. Officials say Cardno will get permission to validate the radar‚Äôs findings by digging just close enough to the graves to confirm their existence without touching them. Additional findings are expected by the end of March. After that, community meetings will be held to discuss what to do. Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Desperation is a sad mobilizing tool.  It‚Äôs unclear if Omar was directly referencing the DailyMail story, but it sure seems like it. However it‚Äôs also curious why Omar would not simply outright deny the story‚Äôs validity if it is not true. Per TCO, In a new report from DailyMail, a Somali community leader Abdihakim Osman has come out to go on the record to speak out on the rumor of Ilhan Omar marrying her brother and he is saying she indeed did it. In addition, Osman goes into detail about how she did it in a way that kept details from the public. DailyMail reports ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù congresswoman Ilhan Omar told friends years ago that the man who went on to become her second husband was in fact her brother, DailyMail.com can confirm. And now for the first time one of those friends has come forward to reveal exactly how Omar and Ahmed Elmi scandalized the Somali community in Minneapolis. Abdihakim Osman is the first person to go on record to speak of how Omar said she wanted to get her brother papers so he could stay in the United States, at a time when she was married to her first husband Ahmed Hirsi. But hardly anyone realized that meant marrying him. ‚ÄòNo one knew there had been a wedding until the media turned up the marriage certificate years later,‚Äô Osman, 40, exclusively told DailyMail.com. Osman‚Äôs revelations are sure to renew calls for an investigation into the Minnesota freshman representative who has repeatedly refused to answer questions on her marriage to Elmi. She originally said the idea that the spouses were also siblings were ‚Äòbaseless, absurd rumors‚Äô, accusing journalists of Islamophobia, but has since stayed quiet. Her spokesman told DailyMail.com that Omar, 37, does not comment on her family or personal life. ‚ÄòThe Congresswoman is focused on the work her constituents sent her to Washington to accomplish,‚Äô he said. Omar married her first husband Hirsi in 2002 in a Muslim ceremony that, like many in the immigrant community, was not registered with the state. Their first child Isra was born the following year and a second followed. But in the late 2000s Elmi appeared in Minneapolis, said Osman, who referred to Hirsi by his nickname ‚ÄòSouthside‚Äô throughout the interview. ‚ÄòPeople began noticing that Ilhan and Southside (Hirsi) were often with a very effeminate young guy,‚Äô Osman said, who spoke in Somali through an interpreter. ‚ÄòHe was very feminine in the way he dressed ‚Äî he would wear light lipstick and pink clothes and very, very, short shorts in the summer. People started whispering about him. ‚Äò[Hirsi] and Ilhan both told me it was Ilhan‚Äôs brother and he had been living in London but he was mixing with what were seen as bad influences that the family did not like. ‚ÄòSo they sent him to Minneapolis as ‚Äùrehab‚Äù.‚Äô Osman, who runs a popular Facebook blog called Xerta Shekh, which comments on Somali issues, said that Omar kept her marriage to Elmi quiet, with no one from the Somali community invited to the wedding. He explained: ‚ÄòWhen [Hirsi] and Ilhan got married, a lot of people were invited. It was a big Islamic wedding uniting two large clans in the Minneapolis community. ‚ÄòI would say there were 100-150 people there.‚Äô But, he said: ‚ÄòWhen she married Elmi, no one even knew about it.‚Äô Osman said at the time Hirsi was better known than Omar among Somalis. ‚ÄòHe was a footballer, he promoted a lot of Somali shows, he was very popular. ‚ÄòSo the scandal was about [Hirsi‚Äôs] brother-in-law more than Ilhan‚Äôs brother.‚Äô It has long been rumored that Omar and Elmi are brother and sister. But because of a lack of paperwork in war-torn Somalia where they were both born, positive proof of their relationship has never been uncovered. Read more here.","none","none",0,0,0,0

Prof. Alex Akpa, the Director-General (DG) of NABDA, said this on Wednesday in Abuja during a courtesy visit by Commonwealth Students/Youth Federation for Peace. Mr Akpa said it was very important that Nigeria should extend this technology to other African countries ‚Äúand I assure you that we will be happy to do that.‚Äô‚Äô The DG disclosed that the variety of bt cotton developed in Nigeria is between 4.2 to 4.5 tonnes per hectare. ‚ÄúIn fact somebody who is a very enlightened farmer got 5 tonnes per hectare and reported that during the last field day in the agency; so you can imagine the dramatic increase. ‚ÄúThe traditional variety gives you between 250 to 750 kilogram per hectare, that is less than one ton per hectare, so you can see the type of thing science can do,‚Äô‚Äô he said. He told the visitors that NABDA had ‚Äúalso done bt cowpea‚Äô‚Äô, and that Nigeria is the first country in the world to develop bt cowpea, an important protein source for low income earners. He disclosed that cowpea (beans) was naturally prone to insect pest attacks, not only in the store but also in the field. ‚ÄúIn the field there is a devastating pest called maruca which can eat up a 10 hectare farm in 10 days, which is a nightmare to farmers,‚Äô‚Äô the DG said. Mr Akpa further disclosed that the bt cowpea developed in Nigeria was resistant to the insect pest, maruca. He said not only that, tiny weevils also tend to eat them up during storage, converting them to dust. He added that out of desperation, business people and even some farmers had tried to preserve beans in the store by using ‚Äúsniper, a very dangerous chemical‚Äô‚Äô. READ ALSO: Fighting financial fraud, cybercrime requires synergy ‚Äì NITDA Mr Akpa said although sniper was an effective pesticide, ‚Äúbut very dangerous, it kills humans‚Äô‚Äô. He said the good news was that ‚Äúwe do bio-fertilizer, bio-insecticide and also bio-fungicide.‚Äô‚Äô According to him, the bio-insecticide is effective in preserving beans in storage by destroying the tiny weevils that destroy these produce in storage. He hinted that the bio-insecticide was ‚Äútotally harmless to the environment and completely harmless to humans because they are normal micro organisms.‚Äô‚Äô The NABDA boss also spoke on what the agency had done on yam seedlings and what they were planning to do this 2020. He expressed appreciation over the visit of the youth federation, saying he was honoured for making him their patron. Earlier, Kewul Suleh, from Ghana and president of the federation said he spoke on behalf of the entire officials serving in the 2018/2022 leadership of the federation. Mr Suleh extolled the virtues of the DG and steadfastness on his firm principles. The visitors also extended an invitation to the DG on their upcoming World Youth Summit to be held in Accra, Ghana.

The program invites listeners to learn more and be part of the American conversation on-air and online. Working together to protect journalists worldwide 'Awakened in You,' an exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, celebrates the gift of Dr. Constance E. Clayton, a collector of African American art and former superintendent of Philadelphia public schools. (Emma Lee/WHYY) After receiving a substantial gift of African American art last year, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is now exhibiting 76 paintings and sculptures that came from the personal collection of the former Philadelphia School District superintendent, Dr. Constance Clayton. Clayton was the first African American woman to be Philadelphia‚Äôs school superintendent, holding that position from 1982 ‚Äì 1993. Toward the end of her tenure, she began collecting art with her mother, Williabell Clayton. The mother and daughter duo wanted to acquire work specifically by African American artists, combing galleries and antique stores with an eye for things that would look good in their shared Mt. Airy home. She also wanted work that told a story or conveyed a message about African American life. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to live with it, I want to like it,‚Äù Clayton said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to buy it because it has someone‚Äôs name on it.‚Äù Clayton continued to collect art after her mother died in 2004, amassing about 300 pieces, including landscapes, domestic scenes, portraits of Black families and children and abstract works. Dr. Constance E. Clayton is photographed with her mother, Williabell Clayton, in whose honor 78 artworks were donated to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. (Courtesy of PAFA) ‚ÄúI love the brilliance of the colors,‚Äù Clayton said. The collection includes minor works by major artists: sketches by Henry Ossawa Tanner and Charles White, a rare charcoal by Barkley Hendricks, two 19th century oil landscapes by Edward Bannister. They are all modestly sized. Most of the collection could be squeezed onto the walls of the Clayton home. ‚ÄúAs a museum director, it is always the most gratifying thing to hear that a collector collected what they liked,‚Äù said Brooke Davis Anderson, director of PAFA‚Äôs museum. ‚ÄúWe know, in the 21st century, collecting has changed a lot in the contemporary art sector. But collecting art because you want to live with it is, at [its] core, a very admirable approach to art collection building.‚Äù When Anderson was invited to visit the Clayton home last year to acquire items for PAFA, she found that they had assembled a serious collection. ‚ÄúI think she and her mom were specifically creating a collection that marched us through the history of African American art,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs what this does.‚Äù The exhibition, ‚ÄúAwakened In You: the Dr. Constance E. Clayton Collection,‚Äù features an entire wall of works by Dox Thrash, the painter and printmaker who benefited from the Works Progress Administration to make work about Black laborers in the Philadelphia shipyards. There is also an etching of Walter Edmund‚Äôs young son. Edmunds is known for the murals inside the Church of the Advocate in North Philadelphia. This charcoal and pastel portrait of a boy, an early work by Barkley L. Hendricks, is one of many depictions of African American children and family life in Constance Clayton‚Äôs collection. (Emma Lee/WHYY) There are two paintings by Laura Wheeler Waring: a portrait of a young Black student in a pensive pose and a group portrait of four Black children. Waring taught for 30 years at Cheyney University and now has a Philadelphia public elementary school named after her. There is a sparse, abstract print by John Dowell, who taught at Temple University‚Äôs Tyler School of Art. The piece doubles as interpretive sheet music (the marks can be read as notations for extended performance techniques, √† la John Cage) . There are several small landscapes by Louis Sloan, who taught at PAFA. Not surprising in a collection assembled by an educator, there are lots of teachers represented here. One of Sloan‚Äôs students was Barkley Hendricks, who would become well-known for his full-body portraits of African Americans in 1970s hipster clothes. Hendricks died in 2017. His widow, Susan, contributed wall text to this exhibition, in which she compared Sloan‚Äôs Philadelphia landscapes to those her late husband painted in Jamaica. ‚ÄúI remember Barkley talking about Lou ‚Äòsuiting up‚Äô in his winter protective gear and going out into the harsh elements to paint the winter landscape outside the central Philadelphia environs,‚Äù Susan Hendricks wrote. ‚ÄúSloan was as devoted to the Philadelphia landscape near and around him as Barkley L. Hendricks was to his beloved tropical Jamaica.‚Äù PAFA asked 15 people ‚Äî including Susan Hendricks, Allan Edmunds of the Brandywine Workshop, and Kelly Lee of the Office of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy ‚Äî to write explanatory texts for the exhibition. The multiplicity of voices on the walls, some of which point out the connections between the artists, give ‚ÄúAwakened In You‚Äù the feel of a community. The artists in the collection taught each other, collaborated with each other and supported one another. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impactful we understand Black artistic networks, that they existed,‚Äù said co-curator Sarah Spencer. ‚ÄúThey were there to elevate one over the other.‚Äù Co-curator Sarah Spencer stands before ‚ÄúThe Study of a Student‚Äù by Laura Wheeler Waring. (Emma Lee/WHYY) After retiring from the school district in 1993, Clayton became involved with Philadelphia‚Äôs cultural sector. In 2000, she became the first chair of Philadelphia Museum of Art‚Äôs African American Collections Committee. In that role, she spearheaded a project to highlight PMA‚Äôs holdings, which became the 2015 exhibition and catalogue, ‚ÄúRepresent: 200 Years of African American Art in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.‚Äù In her preface to that catalogue, Clayton credits her mother, who ‚Äúintroduced me to the arts, encouraging me to study piano, lift my voice in song, and, of course, play with paint and clay and paper.‚Äù She concluded: ‚ÄúIt is my sincere hope that the inspiration I received from my mother‚Äôs love will be awakened in you, the children of Philadelphia, and all the visitors to the museum.‚Äù The title of this show, ‚ÄòAwakened In You,‚Äù was pulled out of that preface. Clayton said she chose PAFA to be the recipient of a gift of some of her collection because of its commitment to exhibiting African American art, and the fact that PAFA is also a school. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a teaching aspect to it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought that was important for children of all races to see, so they can get an understanding of the ability of people who are like them, or of people who are different from them.‚Äù Clayton also gifted a significant portion of her collection to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. But not all of it. Clayton still has art on her walls at home, and still buys when she can. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not cleaning it out. I plan to continue to buy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI buy what I like, and what I can afford. I can‚Äôt afford Tanner anymore.‚Äù From the vaults to the walls at PAFA, women artists are front and center  The exhibition sheds light on the sacrifices and achievements by women artists throughout history to the present day. 22 hours ago Gilbert Lewis remembered as artist, mentor to Philly‚Äôs gay ‚Äô80s  ‚ÄúOnly Tony‚Äù features 25 portraits that Gilbert Lewis painted of a single model during the height of the AIDS epidemic. 1 year ago PAFA invites women to take up space in new feminist exhibition  The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts has reopened in a big way, with big art on big walls that take your breath away with their sheer size. 1 year ago Why did West Chester U. police officers train on social media surveillance?

"84",1404,"https://dailynigerian.com/agbaluma-african-star-apple-damages-fertility/","Agbaluma: African star apple damages fertility - Daily Nigerian","New studies have shown that the ethanolic root bark extract of African cherry may damage fertility in men, The Guardian reports. African cherry is a plant, which has been used in traditional/alternative medicine in Nigeria to treat several health problems, as various parts of this herb have been proved to have a wide range of therapeutic effects. The plant is a rich source of natural antioxidants, which have been established to promote health by acting against oxidative stress related disease such as; diabetics, cancer and coronary heart diseases. Its bark is used for the treatment of yellow fever and malaria while the leaf is used as an emollient and for the treatment of skin eruption, stomachache and diarrhea. The cotyledons from the seeds are used as ointments in the treatment of vaginal and dermatological infections in Western Nigeria and also possess anti-hyperglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, among other health benefits. However, studies have shown that African cherry herbs can also have anti-fertility effects in men. Botanically called Chrysophyllum albidum, African star apple, which belongs to the plant family Sapotaceae is an edible tropical fruit known by various tribal names. It is called Utieagadava in Urhobo; Agbalumo in Yoruba; Udala in Ibo, Efik and Ibibio; Ehya in Igala, Agwaluma in Hausa tribes of Nigeria. In southern Benin, it is called Azongogwe or Azonbobwe in local language.Several studies have been conducted to investigate the antifertility effect of the ethanolic root bark extract of C. albidum on the hormonal levels (pituitary-testicular axis) and caudal epididymal fluid parameters in wistar rats. A study titled: ‚ÄúThe effect of Chrysophyllum albidum fruit on testicular functions in rats‚Äù investigated the effects of C. albidum fruit methanol extract on the reproductive functions of male Wistar rats.Fifteen male Wistar rats were divided into three and received distilled water, which also served as control and extract respectively for 28 days via oral gavage. The sperm count, motility, percentage sperm aberration, histology of testes and epididymides were examined by microscopy.The results showed the serum levels of luteinising hormone (LH), follicle‚Äêstimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone were quantified using ELISA. However, the sperm count significantly increased in, while the serum testosterone level decreased. Findings from the study showed that the architecture of sections of testes and epididymides showed anomalies. C. albidum fruit adversely altered reproductive functions of male Wistar rat.Also, another study published in International Journal of Applied Research in Natural Products by Nigerian researchers validated the antifertility effect of extracts of African cherry in men. The study is titled: ‚ÄúAntifertility Effects of Ethanolic Root Bark Extract of Chrysophyllum Albidum in Male Albino Rats.According to the researchers, the present study was conducted to investigate the antifertility activity of the ethanol root bark extract of Chrysophyllum albidum on sperm parameter and hormonal levels in rats. Eighteen male rats were divided into three groups of six animals each, as each group were administered distilled water that serve as control, ethanol root bark extract on a daily basis. The caudal epididymal sperm count; motility and sperm morphology were observed compared with the control. The result showed that ethanol extract of the root bark of C. albidum suppresses the hormonal levels and sperm production in rats, according to the study.The researchers conclude that the study demonstrated that the root bark of ethanolic extract of C. albidum produces a pronounced inhibition of serum testosterone and gonadrophins concentration. However, these extract had antifertility effect on the testes of albino wistar rats and could be further investigated for possibility of developing a cheap, acceptable and easy available male contraceptive. The researchers said: ‚ÄúThe findings of the present study showed that the ethanolic root bark extract of C. albidum could significantly alter the fertility potential of male rats. The fact that there was significant increase in body weight (p<0.05) on treated animals does not rule out the possibility of a systemic toxicity at the doses treated due to behavioral alterations observed within the treated groups which showed progressive decrease in agility. Furthermore, the significant increase in body weight (p<0.05) indicates that the extract may have toxic effect on the rats. The analysis of caudal epididymal fluids of these treated rats revealed a concomitant decrease in the sperm concentration which may be due to the inhibition in spermatogenesis which has been reflected here by the low count.‚Äù The researchers observed that the ‚Äúpresent study also reveals a significant decrease in sperm motility, which focuses the direct effect of the extract on matured and stored sperm in epididymis, also increased abnormal sperm morphology.‚Äù Another study evaluated the effects of ethanolic leaf extract of Chrysophyllum albidum on hormones and sperm analysis of laboratory rats.The study titled: ‚ÄúEthanolic Leaf Extract of Chrysophyllum albidum on sperm analysis, hormonal profile, SOD and testicular histology of adult male wistar rats‚Äù was published in the Agriculture And Biology Journal of North America. The researchers in their findings showed that ‚ÄúC. albidum leave extract reduced serum levels of gonadotrophins probably by affecting hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis. The treatment does not cause suppression of spermatogenesis but decrease the hormonal profile. The researchers from Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Madonna University, River State concluded that the ‚ÄúC. albidum leave extract reduced serum levels of gonadotrophins probably by affecting hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis. The reduced levels of FSH, LH and T do not have effect on the testicular spermatogenesis for 21 days. However there was an increase in the SOD enzyme activities above the control level thereby improving its antioxidative capacity.‚Äù Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

VAR had already made its debut in the Moroccan Cup semi-finals and final, but on Friday it featured in IRT Tangier's 2-1 win over FUS Rabat in the league. The use of VAR was set to start at the beginning of the league season but was delayed in order to give the Morocco football federation time to train referees and obtain the video refereeing licenses. ""We have installed the VAR in our stadiums. We hope this technology will be positive for the teams, fans, officials, referees, and Moroccan football in general"", said Yahya Hadqa, head of the Moroccan Arbitration Directorate. Morocco's football federation president, Fawzi Lekjaa, has already issued a stark warning to referees. ""Those who are not qualified for this new technique will not officiate in Morocco."" During the past few months, Moroccan referees have taken part in a variety of training courses to use the technology, whether as main referees or at the video hall. In addition to the training sessions for referees, the Arbitration Directorate also worked on preparing the national stadiums to fulfil the criteria to use VAR technology.

"87",1513,"https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2020-02-20-african-penguin-population-plummets/","African penguin population plummets","The African penguin population in Algoa Bay has plummeted by at least 30% in the last four years ‚Äî and that is bad news all round, penguin specialist researcher Dr Lorien Pichegru said yesterday. The species is already officially classified as endangered, with its population having dropped 70% since 2004. About half the remaining 15,000-odd breeding pairs across the bird‚Äôs global range, from Namibia to the western section of the Eastern Cape coast, occur in Algoa Bay, and St Croix Island is still home to the single biggest colony, she said. ‚ÄúBut while the numbers on Bird Island have remained stable, the numbers on St Croix are declining fast, from 7,500 to 4,500 breeding pairs ‚Äî so 30-40% down in the past four years.‚Äù The numbers, collated during annual census surveys undertaken in partnership with SANParks and the department of environment, forestry and fisheries, were quite clear and extremely worrying, she said. ‚ÄúEven if you don‚Äôt love penguins, it should be a concern, because seabirds like penguins show us what is going on down below the surface of the ocean where we cannot easily see. ‚ÄúWhat happens to the penguins is happening to the fish is happening to the fishermen and in the end will happen to all of us who rely on the oceans for food, tourism and a multitude of other reasons.‚Äù There was likely a combination of reasons for the decline, she said. ‚ÄúSome of the possible factors include that there is insufficient food which in turn could relate to climate change and fishing. ‚ÄúOther possible factors include increased seismic survey activity and predation by seals who eat penguins when there are not enough fish. ‚ÄúIt could also be due an increase in shipping traffic in our bay related to offshore bunkering, as well as to the recent oil spills. ‚ÄúIt could also include an increased pollution load coming down our rivers.‚Äù Pichegru said her assessment of the drop off in penguin numbers on St Croix correlated with an increase in the number of carcasses she had been finding during her beach surveys east of the Sundays River over the past six years.

On Tuesday afternoon, a formal dedication was hosted to introduce a new permanent exhibit, ‚ÄúTime Brings About a Change,‚Äù with two wood burning art pieces, ‚ÄúTime Brings About a Change,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor Who?‚Äù both created by O‚ÄôLarry Collins. ‚ÄúTime Brings About a Change,‚Äù features three African Americans who had significant impacts on Dowagiac and Michigan‚Äôs history, Thomas Jefferson Martin, Chief George Grady and Sam Fowlkes, said Museum Director Steve Arseneau. ‚ÄúIt means a lot as an artist,‚Äù Collins said on Tuesday, standing in front of his work. ‚ÄúAs a black artist and knowing George Grady and knowing Sam Fowlkes, it was a beautiful thing. They are real, nice, good people. It was a privilege for me to do [the piece]. When Mayor [Don] Lyons approached me about doing them, I thought so much of him for wanting to have that done for us here in Dowagiac.‚Äù Representing George Grady, a Dowagiac native and decorated Korean War veteran, was his son, Dennis Grady, who said he had waited 43 years for someone to honor his father‚Äôs sacrifice and dedication to Dowagiac. ‚ÄúMy dad and I would have private conversations, and sometimes, he would get me up at 3 a.m.,‚Äù Dennis said. ‚ÄúOne thing I remember about my dad was a lot of times, I cleaned his guns and shined his shoes. To this day, when I shine my shoes, I still remember what he had me do. He would talk to me about being a gentleman. He would say ‚ÄòDenny, if you are going to be anything, be a man.‚Äô‚Äù George served as a deep-sea diver in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. In 1955, he returned to Dowagiac and joined the police force. George rose through the ranks and, in 1965, was named the first African American police chief in the state of Michigan. He died at the age of 44 from a heart attack. Dennis joined the Michigan State Police in 1979 and retired in 2003 after a 25-year career. He still remembers thinking of his dad while in the academy. ‚ÄúI will die here before I let him down,‚Äù Dennis said. Sam Fowlkes was one of Dowagiac‚Äôs local civil rights organizers and a leader in the African American community for decades, Arseneau said. Representing the Fowlkes family was Tyree Blackamore, the ninth grandson of Sam and Bessie Fowlkes. ‚ÄúThe two of them taught us to be proud, to be of standing members of the community, to speak for truth and injustice and to offer a hand to all‚Äî no matter the color of one‚Äôs skin or social status,‚Äù Blackamore said. ‚Äú[Fowlkes] had an amazing ability to see the big picture and what that might mean for the community as well as us.‚Äù Blackamore remembered when Fowlkes was reelected to Dowagiac City Council. He was often answering questions from residents of his ward and sharing his views on different situations. Fowlkes was a local businessman and one of the first African Americans to serve on the city council. He served from 1965 to 1971 and again from 1986 to 1997. He also served on the Cass County Planning Commission from 1968 to 1997 and served as vice-chairman from 1988 to 1996. In 1947, Fowlkes worked at Dowagiac Steel Furnace, while putting time towards his own upholstery shop, Fowlkes‚Äô Upholstery. In 1962, Dowagiac Steel Furnace closed, and Fowlkes started driving school buses for Dowagiac Union Schools. He retired from the school district in 1979 but kept his upholstery business into the 2000s. Lastly, Thomas Jefferson Martin‚Äôs remarks were made by Arseneau as his family line ended with his son, C. Fabe Martin, who had no children. Martin was born in Tennessee to a white politician and his slave mistress. In 1820, Martin‚Äôs father granted him freedom. He became a barber and worked on steamboats alongside the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. He was also active on the Underground Railroad in southern Indiana. In 1855, he planted roots in Dowagiac and opened his own barbershop. He quickly became a leader of the state‚Äôs African American community as the elected chair of the first Michigan convention of African American residents hosted in Battle Creek in 1860. Martin would later call the second convention in 1884. He also led the state‚Äôs Prince Hall Free and Accepted Masons Lodge. The exhibit was made possible by a donation from Don and Joan Lyons, of Lyons Industries in Dowagiac. ‚ÄúWhen I first went into Mr. Collin‚Äôs shop and saw his work, ‚ÄúFor Who?‚Äù I was dumbstruck,‚Äù Don Lyons said. ‚ÄúThat was one of the most powerful images on the tragedy of racism that I thought I‚Äôd ever seen.‚Äù Lyons said the image stuck with him for days, weeks and months afterward. He thought if it had such a positive impact on him, it needed to be shared. Collins, who is also a downtown merchant, owns Art Enuh Suit. ‚ÄúOne of the things we are focusing on is to make the community more inclusive,‚Äù Lyons said. ‚ÄúIf you go downtown, you don‚Äôt nearly have the African American presence that we would like to see.‚Äù As the reception was about to end, Arseneau hoped this permanent exhibit would be the start of a larger one. By 1910, Cass County had the highest concentration of African American residents in Michigan, outside of Detroit and Grand Rapids, according to census records, Arseneau said. ‚ÄúLater, Dowagiac was a landing spot for many African Americans who fled the south to find work in factories and the rust belt during and after World War II,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMany of the families here today are a result of the migration during the post-war period.‚Äù Arseneau encouraged families to look around their homes for artifacts and photographs to help tell the story of those families in Dowagiac and Cass County. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this the beginning of the museum‚Äôs relationship with the families here today and the local African American community,‚Äù Arseneau said. ‚ÄúThis is your museum, too.‚Äù","none","none",0,0,0,0

The Roots 101 African American Museum on Main Street in downtown Louisville, Ky. LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Architectural Digest has named Louisville‚Äôs Roots 101 African American Museum one of the 20 top new museums in the world. The museum, at 819 W. Main St., is still working on fundraising and is open for private tours only, but it's expected to open to the public full-time soon. Lamont Collins, a collector from Louisville and museum‚Äôs founder, said he was excited by the ‚Äúincredible honor‚Äù to receive such a recognition, which was recognized for its design alongside facilities in Washington, London and Giza, Egypt. Collins has told WDRB News that he loves Louisville and wants to help the city ‚Äî and the rest of the country ‚Äî heal from its past. The museum will tell ‚Äúthe story of the African American journey from Africa and all ports in between,‚Äù Collins has said. Visitors will enter into the museum through the hull of a slave ship. They‚Äôll travel through part of the Underground Railroad on a virtual reality tour and through four floors of historical artifacts. The book ‚ÄúThe Clansman‚Äù is displayed near other derogatory images and pieces of Ku Klux Klan propaganda. One poster reads ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be half a man, join the Klan.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis started from my personal passion,‚Äù said Collins, a Fern Creek High School graduate who played football at the University of Louisville. ‚ÄúI think what they should feel is the pride of the history but also the warts of the history.

Lt Colonel LeRoy Bruwer, 49, working in the Mpumalanga province, 200 miles north east of Johannesburg, was described by colleagues as a ‚Äúwildlife fanatic.‚Äù As a senior officer in the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations, known as The Hawks, Colonel Bruwer was highly experienced in sophisticated and often dangerous investigations into rhino poaching syndicates. Police cordoned off the road where Colonel Bruwer was killed and say there are three bullet holes on the driver‚Äôs window of his vehicle. Some rhino poachers arrested by Colonel Bruwer were former policemen Four years ago Col Bruwer testified in court that he and a colleague were detained by police when they tried to charge two officers linked to a rhino poaching case. He was currently lead detective in another two high profile rhino poaching cases. Col Bruwer was decorated four years ago as the best detective in the Hawks. Advocate Kobus van der Walt, head of the Mpumalanga Asset Forfeiture Unit, said Col Bruwer was one of the most dedicated policemen he had ever worked with. ‚ÄúHis death leaves an incredible gap in the legal system especially in investigations into rhino poaching,‚Äù he told News24 early on Tuesday. Col Bruwer lived close to where he was killed, not far from the Mozambique border where many rhino horns are illegally exported and then sold on to buyers, often from Vietnam. South Africa has 80 percent of the world‚Äôs remaining rhinos and one is killed every 10 hours, according to official government statistics.

CS Pramesh, the Director of Tata Memorial Hospital, says that as part of the collaboration agreement with TMH, local specialists in C/Can cities will receive training in Mumbai on areas of cancer care, delivered within a ‚Äòtrain-the-trainers‚Äô framework. ‚ÄúDirect contact between local specialists in C/Can‚Äôs African and Asian cities and TMH specialists will also be provided, while TMH specialists will join e-learning platforms and/or visit C/Can cities in those regions to train local specialists on priority areas of cancer care,‚Äù he outlines. The city of Kigali (Rwanda), Kumasi (Ghana) and Yangon (Myanmar) have already conducted a comprehensive assessment of cancer care capacity and needs involving nearly 200 health professionals in all specialities and over 15 health institutions from both the public and private sectors. Following these needs assessments, these cities have identified and agreed on the main challenges in accessing quality and equitable cancer care in the city. New members of the C/Can network in Africa and Asia, such as Greater Petaling, in Malaysia, which joined in September 2019, will benefit from the agreement with TMH as they progress with their needs assessment. Tata Memorial Hospital is the pioneer cancer hospital in India, and its focus on providing quality cancer care to patients through evidence based management protocols work has been recognized internationally. The hospital is also involved in human resource development for cancer care, conducting relevant cancer research and shaping cancer policy for the country.

"96",1851,"https://www.healthyfoodhouse.com/rhino-poachers-eaten-alive-by-lions-on-south-african-wildlife-reserve/","Rhino Poachers Eaten Alive By Lions On South African Wildlife Reserve","Wildlife poaching is a crime that harms local communities, wildlife populations, and the environment in various ways. It is fueled by a lucrative black market trade of animal parts, and numerous environmental groups, animal rights groups, and government agencies are calling for an end to it. Rhino poaching is a severe threat in all rhino range states, as the horns of these animals are highly valuable. They are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and are also seen as a status symbol to display success and wealth. The Sibuya Game Reserve is located in the South African province of Eastern Cape, and it is the home of numerous animals, including the five biggest game animals in Africa: lions, rhinos, elephants, buffalos, and leopards. Over the last years, there have been several intrusions by poachers. However, an incident that happened in 2018 can now serve as a warning for them to stay away. Namely, when a group of poachers entered the reserve to hunt rhinos, a pack of lions devoured them! It is believed there were three men, as investigators found three sets of shoes and gloves, but very little of their remains were left.  Nick Fox, the park‚Äôs owner, believes that this was because the predators had many hours to feast, as the poachers were eaten alive sometime between the evening of July 1 and the early morning of July 2. He said: ‚ÄúThe only body part we found was one skull and one bit of pelvis, everything else was completely gone.‚Äù He guessed that the incident probably happened around 4:30 a.m. on July 2, as then, one of the reserve‚Äôs anti-poaching dogs gave a warning. Yet, it was ignored by the dog handler, as this was typical behavior for that time of the morning. Later on in the day, one of the rangers found the bloodied remains, and they immediately notified the police. Fox said: ‚ÄúAt about 4.30 pm on Tuesday, one of our field guides on game drive alerted the Anti-Poaching Unit that there appeared to be human remains as well as other items in the immediate vicinity of the lions. I was immediately called to the scene where along with the APU we found the high powered rifle, gloves, wire cutters and the remains of a backpack with food, water, and other supplies. We immediately alerted the Indalo (Association of Eastern Cape Game Reserves) Anti-Poaching Cluster and the Police. Clearly, the poachers had walked into a pride of six lions and some, if not all had been killed.‚Äù Police spokeswoman Captain Mali Govender said: ‚ÄúWe do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before.‚Äù They called in a search party and enlisted the help of a helicopter to scout for any survivors, but they found none. Fox added: ‚ÄúWe found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more. They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here.‚Äù  He hopes that this incident will send a message to poachers not to risk their lives by illegally hunting game: ‚ÄúWhilst we have saddened at any loss of life the poachers came here to kill our animals and this sends out a very clear message to any other poachers that you will not always be the winner. The lions are our watchers and guardians and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal.‚Äù He said that numerous people called him to ask about the fate of the lions, and he explained: ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt be killed. The status quo will continue.‚Äù  The number of rhinos is drastically reduced all around the world, mostly due to habitat loss and poaching. In the past decade, over 7,000 of them have been killed in South Africa only. Believe it or not, a single horn can be sold for up to $300,000, but on the South African black market, white rhino horns sell for up to just $3,000. In 2016, poachers entered The Sibuya Game Reserve, shot three rhinos dead, and cut off their horns. This time, poachers ended up as preys.

All Rights Reserved Facebook and Twitter on Thursday announced they have dismantled a Russia-backed online interference campaign targeting African Americans. The campaign was based out of Ghana and Nigeria, marking Russia's latest attempt to obfuscate how it's working to sow discord on U.S. soil by propping up volunteers and workers from foreign nations. Russia was supporting the workers based in the two African nations, who were tasked with spreading divisive and polarizing messages, specifically targeted at black social media users in the U.S., according to a CNN investigation published Thursday. Facebook removed 49 accounts, 69 pages and 85 Instagram accounts for engaging in foreign interference on its platforms, the company announced. ""This network was in the early stages of building an audience and was operated by local nationals ‚Äî some wittingly and some unwittingly ‚Äî in Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of individuals in Russia,"" Facebook said. ""It targeted primarily the United States."" Twitter suspended 71 accounts ""largely Tweeting in English and that presented themselves as based in the United States,"" the company said. ""These 71 removed accounts, operating out of Ghana and Nigeria and which we can reliably associate with Russia, attempted to sow discord by engaging in conversations about social issues, like race and civil rights,"" Twitter wrote.

""The companies must continue working together and be as transparent as possible with the public and their users moving forward."" Since 2016, when Russian trolls successfully manipulated the world's largest social media networks to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, the tech industry has been on high alert to defend against foreign interference from Russia and other hostile foreign actors. Twitter, Facebook and Google have poured enormous resources and energy into detecting and removing influence campaigns, which often involve posts about divisive topics and bunk news stories. But as the tech companies have cracked down, Russia and other countries have expanded and advanced their techniques. The takedowns on Thursday exemplified a new online influence tactic: Russians helped prop up a nonprofit in Ghana dedicated to spreading messages in the U.S. about social issues, specifically aimed at fanning the flames of racial divisions, CNN reported. The posts were focused on topics like ""black history, black excellence and fashion, celebrity gossip, news and events related to famous Americans like historical figures and celebrities, and LGBTQ issues,"" Facebook said, as well as ""police brutality."" Russian trolls in 2016 also targeted black voters in an effort to deter the minority population from voting and intensify tensions around the Black Lives Matter movement. Kailee Scales, managing director of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, told CNN that her organization has been watching for online interference targeting the African American community. ""We are walking into the 2020 election cycle with eyes wide open to the fact that international and domestic actors are striving to undermine our organizing, and we are not going to let that happen,"" Scales said.

The disease is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and is spread by biting midges. Horses are considered the most susceptible, with nearly 90% dying if infected. It kills roughly half of infected mules and 10% of donkeys. Infected African donkeys and mules rarely show signs of disease. The Thailand outbreak is understood to be the first time the disease has been confirmed in the country. It is centered in the Pak Chong area, according to the Thailand Equestrian Federation‚Äôs veterinary adviser, Dr Metha Chanda. Chanda told the International Equestrian Federation‚Äôs veterinary director, Dr G√∂ran Akerstr√∂m, in a letter on Saturday that the emergence of the disease had been confirmed by the country‚Äôs Department of Livestock Development (DLD). Authorities have suspended the movement of all horses and equine species within a 150km radius of the outbreak. People are required to report any sudden death or suspected cases to the DLD. ‚ÄúRestricted movement and good hygiene must be followed among the horses located outside of the outbreak zone,‚Äù Chanda says. Checkpoints will be watching for any illegal movements of equines. ‚ÄúFurther measures may be launched to minimize and control the outbreak of the disease,‚Äù he says. Chanda says 42 horses have been reported dead so far out of 62 cases. He says 341 horses in the outbreak area are susceptible to the disease. He says the reaction of the Thailand Equestrian Federation has been swift, with members told to restrict horse movements and to follow relevant measures advised by the DLD. ‚ÄúOur deepest sympathy goes out to those who have lost horses due to this terrible virus. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to update everyone and follow all protocols in order to best protect all horses in Thailand,‚Äù he says. It is understood the deaths have occurred across several barns in the outbreak area. Latest research and information from the horse world.

"101",1923,"https://africafreak.com/hunting-success-rate","What African Predators Have the Highest Hunting Success Rate?","African predators are truly beautiful to behold. Nature lovers from all over the world regularly flock to destinations in Africa, hoping for a glimpse of these marvels of nature on a safari drive. The very lucky get to see wild animals that hunt, hopefully just as they take down their prey. There are several species of big cats and dog families roaming the savannah and veld. As prey becomes their means to survival, the mythical ‚Äòcircle of life‚Äô essentially gets to play out in real-time. Which of these predatory animals is the most efficient hunter? Which predators hunt alone and which do their deeds in packs? Let‚Äôs look at the big African predators with the highest hunting success rates.  A lion‚Äôs reputation as an apex predator may well be a little undeserved. While you would certainly lose a fight, they are not prolific hunters at all, compared to some others on the continent. Lions hunting solo have dismal success rates at under 19%. In a pack ‚Äì led by females ‚Äì they‚Äôre slightly more successful at up to 25% success. They‚Äôre probably on the wrong side of the curve because they‚Äôre notoriously lazy, can‚Äôt really run over long distances, and prefer to steal others‚Äô fruits of their labor. Yes, lions will muscle in and steal the prey of other predators. Stalking and ambushing is so much work.  Let‚Äôs continue with an unexpected and somewhat disputed contender ‚Äì the hyena. Many will argue that hyenas are scavengers and not hunter animals. They are only partly right. Hyenas are indeed opportunistic scavengers, but also very efficient killers when they need to be. They can acquire up to 75% of their own food by hunting and killing it. In the Kruger National Park, rangers estimate that at least half their food is self-acquired. So let‚Äôs not disregard this fearsome-looking powerhouse. It‚Äôs estimated that they have a 33% success rate at whatever they target ‚Äì which isn‚Äôt bad at all! For some context, compare that to the elusive leopard.  The gorgeous leopard is a bashful creature, and you‚Äôd be lucky to see one on a safari. But it‚Äôs a very decent hunter. Kill rates of up to 38% are reported, especially in Southern Africa. The leopard may not look as intimidating as the lion, but it is extremely powerful ‚Äì pound for pound the strongest predator on the continent. It drags prey up to half its weight into the branches of a tree to avoid having it nabbed by scavengers and thieves like the lion.  The cheetah challenges the lion as the most famous of the African big cat predators. The reason is the incredible grace with which the speedy cheetah chases down its target. Many nature documentaries have shown us the amazing action in slow motion as cheetahs clock up to 75 mph on camera. Not surprisingly, they can boast up to a 58% success rate on their hunts. It‚Äôs the lucky prey that gets away, as cheetahs are fast, but only over relatively short distances. When they are successful, cheetahs are too exhausted to defend their catch from the ever-present opportunists like our friend the lion, jackals, and hyenas.  It‚Äôs a less well-known cat and the smallest of all the wild cats in Africa. Yet the black-footed cat is a very efficient killer. At just 17 inches in body length, it may not look formidable. But small rodents, birds and rabbits will attest that this kitty can kill with the best of them, with around 60% success rate.  More than that, they actually are clinical when they‚Äôre on a roll. They can make 10-15 kills every night. Technically, that might make them the most successful predator of the lot. Call them cute at your peril.  Which brings us to the big dog‚Ä¶ literally. African wild dogs are hugely talented when it comes to hunting prey, and undoubtedly this list‚Äôs best hunting animals. If a pack targets a prey, there‚Äôs an 85% chance they‚Äôll bring it down successfully. As a pack, they‚Äôre not only overwhelming in numbers, but also very persistent. Sadly for them, they lose a lot of their spoils to the ever-present threat of other carnivores. African wild dogs are also endangered, which is a shame. They are definitely contenders for #1 predator in the world ‚Äì at least, in terms of efficiency.  It‚Äôs worth noting that birds of prey are also very good at hunting. Here‚Äôs a short list of birds that challenge for the title of Africa‚Äôs best predator. For the most part, these are the best hunters in Africa. It‚Äôs not all success, though, as clearly the hunt is only half the game. In many cases, it also becomes a question of an animal predator holding onto the kill as bigger or more numerous predators are always looking to steal the prize. It‚Äôs also clear that those who hunt in packs tend to do a lot better than solo artists. And in many cases, mothers with young will go for easier prey to feed their litters. In the end, it‚Äôs not a race, but African predators can be deadly, and even at low success rates, they are truly beautiful to see. Make a point of trying to spot them on your next safari trip. LIONS ARE REMARKABLE AND UNIQUE IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM Considering lions live mostly in open fields of the world‚Äôs hottest continent. Lions don‚Äôt benefit from the same camouflage advantages of the thick vegetations of the jungle. The African savanna is where the biggest, tallest, fastest and more aggressive animals are found. Between their numerous violent fights with other lions or hyena clans they hunt, often outnumbered, the biggest prey on earth. Considering the single lion that has the greatest predator-prey weight ratio and face the greatest challenges of all the land predators, their successful hunt-rates are amazing. After all, no big land predators have a more brutal and violent lifestyle as the mighty lion. It‚Äôs a shame that so much of this information is misleading, exaggerated and based on debunked misconceptions. There‚Äôs also no links to scholarly works that prove any of these claims. Hi Leesa, Can you please be more specific about the things you find ‚Äúmisleading, exaggerated and based on debunked misconceptions‚Äù? The study of ‚Äúhunting success rates‚Äù is forever evolving. So if you have more accurate information on the matter, we‚Äôd be delighted to hear it. Keep well, Michael Your email address will not be published.

Animal cruelty is one of the most disgusting things to ever exist. Though there have been several measures that different communities and organizations take to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen but its a shame to admit that there are places where animals are still treated so poorly. Recently in South African Farm, a case of animal cruelty has been reported where 108 diseased and abused lions were found. According to the people in South Africa, it is the most shocking case of animal neglect that they have ever witnessed. More Info: Human Society International   The news went viral when an anonymous source posted the pictures of the abused lions on the internet. The lions apparently lost all the fur which is said to be the result of a disease called mange, which is a skin disease caused by parasite mites. The lions were kept in an overcrowded facility. 30 lions were kept in the space that was only meant for two. You can imagine the amount of animal neglect that these lions had to face. The environment that they were kept in was very filthy. We can imagine the condition of these abused lions through these pictures. After this news came in light, Douglas Wolhunter, the manager of the National Council for Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA), visited the South African farm and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to describe because it leaves you feeling hollow, knowing that you‚Äôve got the king of the jungle in conditions like that. It‚Äôs soul-destroying.‚Äù  The particular South African Farm is called the Pienika form. Upon investigation it was found that there has been more than 100 abused lions, caracal, leopards, and tigers were kept there and were found in horrendous condition.  It is important for any breeding farm to provide a clean and hygienic atmosphere to the lions as well as to let the cubs have proper nourishment. Naturally, the cubs stay for 18 months with their mothers. But the condition of this South African farm does not provide them with any of their necessity.  The Wildlife Director at Humane Society International, Audrey Delsink, said: ‚ÄòSouth Africa‚Äôs captive lion breeding industry is a vicious cycle of exploitation, from cradle to grave.‚Äù ‚ÄòLion cubs are ripped from their mothers at just a few days old, to be hand-reared by paying volunteers from countries around the world such as the United Kingdom, who are misled into believing the cubs are orphans. The cubs have exploited their whole lives, first as props by paying tourists looking for selfie shots whilst petting or bottle-feeding the animals, then later as part of ‚Äòwalking with lion‚Äô safaris.‚Äô  He continued by saying, ‚ÄúIn the face of so much evidence supporting the significant welfare atrocities and illegal activities, and the bogus standards presented by the industry, the South African government cannot stand idle. ‚ÄòWe demand that the government shut down this industry once and for all; that is the only way brand South Africa can recover from this significant scourge.‚Äù  Read More: China‚Äôs Youngest Coronavirus Patient Recovers From The Disease Without Medication  No One Cares ‚ÄúNo One Cares‚Äù Is a Part Of Psifiako Media Pvt.

"103",1957,"https://africanconservation.org/south-africa-wants-to-promote-wildlife-consumption/","South Africa wants to promote wildlife consumption - African Conservation Foundation","by ACFMar 25, 2020Bushmeat, Conservation Threats, Corona virus32 comments South Africa is turning towards the implementation of new laws that fully allows the economic exploitation of wildlife. The intention is to market the use of all kinds of wild species, including giraffes, zebras, emu, and duikers, in order to produce cheap meat. However, the current corona virus crisis shows this can be a public health, economic and ecological disaster. Despite the pandemic, and despite the causes of this zoonosis, South Africa is preparing to expand and intensify captive breeding of wild species and sell their meat in the food markets. This is an alarming turning point in the nation‚Äôs immense biological heritage management policies. The plan was published in the Official Gazette on 28 February in a proposal to revise the Meat Safety Act, the law that has regulated meat production since 2000. The proposal is to expand the number of non-domestic but edible species ‚Äúthat can be slaughtered as food for humans or for animal consumption‚Äù. The list contains 104 species, including: zebras, red hartebeest, wildebeest, springbok, dik dik, lechwe, kudu, duiker, gemsbok, eland, impala, rhinos (black and white), hippos, giraffes, elephants and crocodiles. The proposal also points out that ‚Äúthis scheme includes animals that are listed as endangered species, in accordance with conservation measures, and therefore their slaughter for both human and animal consumption must be in line with the most relevant conservation indications‚Äù. For some time, conservation and breeding have been going on the same track in South Africa. The move by the Government, in which the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture move along a concerted path dotted with legal gaps, has not surprised those in South Africa working in the conservation and in the wildlife farming industry, which supplies trophy animals to hunters and lion bones to Chinese and South East Asian buyers. In May 2019, the previous Minister of Agriculture had passed an amendment to a 1998 law, the Animal Improvement Act (AIA), to reclassify 33 wildlife species as farm animals, including lions, cheetahs, rhinos and zebras, without public consultation. This allow these animals to be used for breeding, slaughtering and genetic manipulation in farms scattered across the country, the notorious wildlife farms. As a result, these wildlife farms can use artificial insemination and genetic manipulation to obtain animals with special characteristics, for example faster, larger or of a different colour. These animals are highly sought after by hunters, who seek out-of-norm trophies for their collections. The government of South Africa has decided to turn towards a complete ‚Äúwildlife economy‚Äù where wild animals are a raw material on which to plan profits. South Africa has now taken a path of use of its fauna which is transforming the country into a genetic laboratory in the name of ‚Äúsustainable development‚Äù. In the midst of an increasingly serious economic crisis, while education levels in the country are also decreasing, the government turns to extraction of resources at all costs for an immediate profit. While China, on February 24, decided to ban wildlife trade by also asking CITES for more stringent measures, South Africa seems to want to take a completely opposite path, in defiance not only of the precautionary principle, but of international concerns Nobody knows how many of the animals on the Chinese markets came from South Africa and the country is preparing to expand a market that hides unknown oublic health dangers. For this reason, on March 21, which is Human Rights Day in South Africa, the EMS Foundation together with about sixty other organizations and institutions will demonstrate in Cape Town to ask the Minister of the Environment Barbara Creecy to close the meat industry and to take a position against Covid-19 and against the consumption of wild meat. People will be virtually united for animal, environmental and human rights, which are strictly related. Please find the full story here: La Stampa (in Italian) Author: Elisabetta Corr√† The Coronavirus pandemic is revealing the best and worst leadership in the world. This has to rate amongst the latter, up there with the USA, Brazil, Australia and North Korea! This cannot be allowed as it is our wildlife is exploited and many species are on the brink of extinction. As it is cattle, chickens, pigs and others are living lives in captivity and misery. Now they want to put animals who are born to be wild to also live in misery. No this cannot be allowed. I agree 100%. There is enough food for large populations by growing vegetables, rice, herbs and spices to use for a variety of meals. Wildlife MUST be kept wild! The eco safari is the way to go once the Coronna virus has been extinguished. Why is it that Kenya is doing brilliantly in conservation and not SA? As I see it, South Africa is being brainwashed into this industry(if you can call it that)- by allowing themselves to be influenced by the thinking of certain so-called humans- that shall remain nameless( am sure everyone knows who they are). Just a sign of how greedy & how cruel these sub-humans are- with no regard for conservation or for these sentient beings- not to talk of the fact , that one does not have to consume meat!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as some cultures dictate , that the only way to live, is by consuming large quantities of meat!!!!!!!!!. I for one am a vegetarian & live a healthy life- no colestrol, high blood pressure or diabetes, or weight problems- speaks for itself!- wake up South Africa & the rest of the world for that matter!If the virus that is making people ‚Äúdrop like flies‚Äù does not show humans the error of their ways, then there is no hope for the future generations Absolutely disgusting This is just flippin crazy. Its the worse idea to ever be suggested. After this pandemic which has killed so many people and caused such economic tragedy to the world.i cannot understand why this is even been considered and that we are now fighting to stop this idiotic plan. I support you 100 percent !! This is outrageous! Wild life should be protected not to be used for human consumption. Stop the world I want off Be it enacted‚Ä¶ this will be the start of a new pandemic, zoonotic diseases galore! Horrendous! Hideous! As a qualified conservationist and wildlife inspector this goes against all conservation efforts and by no means close to best practices! Where is the IUCN and CITES in this? What loopholes are in NEMBA, NEMA? How can this be promoted‚Ä¶ our legislation is as vague as our legislators and definitely not worth the paper it is on. Can we start a petition to oppose this? Besides the promotion to consume wildlife, there are countless wildlife captive animal welfare concerns. This cannot be allowed. People need to stop eating animals. The cruelty and torcher should not be allowed You cant be serious ! I would say South Africa has the very worst leaders who have looted the country dry. Not only that, the infrastructure is crumbling ‚Äì there is no functioning electricity and many many other breakdowns go unrepaired. I left South Africa 34 years ago for the US, and am I glad I did. Hope you survive there This development towards wildlife, people and the health of the environment is unconscionable and so ignorant and dis-compassionate; one can barely write the words. It must stop now before it goes further; and the people not only of South Africa, but all around the globe must express their opinions about this incomprehensible stance that South Africa is developing vis a vis it‚Äôs stewardship with the wild animal of it‚Äôs country‚Ä¶..if not even more, then at least the Corona Virus has brought the sinister and deadly truth of that home. This cannot be allow they are killing our nature. This is totally unacceptable. We are already dealing with Caronavirus worldwide. China is shutting down wildlife markets (hopefully permanently). Its ludicrous to think that South Africa wants to deal in wildlife now. I am totally against this proposal. Our wildlife are already under tremendous strain. It shortsighted decision for South African rich biodiversity. It will accelerate transnational environmental crimes that is devastating flora and fauna. Environmental NGO have to sharply opposite SA government decision. Have we learnt nothing from Wuhan and the Corina virus? Our wildlife are to be protected, not eaten. Dont expoit the animals we are meant to protect. SA government wske up and learn‚Ä¶bush meat is not for human consuption. You will cause more pandemics like Covid 19 and Ebola. Protect and prmote our SA wildlife. No to hunting,selling and eating SA wildlife! Tread lightly. You have no right to market the use of any type of animal. Nature is not ours to exploit as we wish. No respect. There should be a worldwide ban called for on tourism to SA. This is beyond sickening. We were lucky enough to go on several wonderful safaris fifteen years ago back when the country was thriving and well- managed, but as things are now we would never go back. It‚Äôs so tragic to do this to those beautiful animals, plus of course the very real risk of other pandemics. China and now South Africa. This country is a joke!! The country will be punished for Abusing and Exploiting God‚Äôs creatures and nature!! We have just learn that the Corona virus was caused by selling wild animals (alive and dead) at a ‚Äúwet market‚Äù and now the SA government want to promote the selling of the meat. There must be somebody giving out money and somebody receiving money under the table again. Disgraceful decision. Seems that money comes first. Our wildlife is our heritage. Animals also have rights. They were here before humans This is way way way beyond STUPID!! So South Africa is contributing to world syndication by endorsing wild animals as a food source. Are the viruses that we are experiencing world wide not warning enough that this practice is unacceptable ‚Äì let alone that all rational people disagree with this proposal. Let me think‚Ä¶‚Ä¶exchange of money and hand in hand with other foreign Governments to enrich themselves ‚Äì um yes. Africa and South Africa is notorious for allowing foreign countries to exploit natural resources‚Ä¶..never thinking further than their greedy, sweaty, money grabbing fingers. How easily they are influenced. The cruel sub-species called ‚Äòhumans‚Äô are an absolute abomination to the longevity of this planet. The rest of the world are moving away from large meat consumption to vegetation based diets but as usual SA is behind the times, not only in their actions but in the way they think and respond. Money, money, money ‚Äì the root of all evil. Cruelty, greed, corruption and destruction the only language our species understands until its too late‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ typical of south africa, they already sell baby elephants to china, tearing them away from their mothers, just so china can have them, these countries make me sick. My question is why put SA in a lockdown and stop life as we know it and ruin the economy and lifelyhoods if we have learned nothing? Why have over 70 000 Corona Virus infections and trying to flaten the curve as Goverment calls it?? While during behind this pandemic and economic crisis caused by lockdowns and poaching, and wildlife trades, Goverment are looking to open and increase this trade? All the Covid talk, treatmens, and effort are invane and the human life renderd worthless!! SARS, HIV, Ebola and now Covid when will we learn.?These Are all Zootonic meaning came from exotic animals(wildlife) and still it costs Goverment thousands of million of ZAR for treatment of these deaseses and not even talking about human suffering or death by the millions why then allow and aprove the source of these pandemics? Why?? When there are many other safer ways to create food security this is not it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ No No No !!!!!!!!!!! I support you 100% I say no‚Ä¶. This is going to drive all animals to extinction‚Ä¶who eats Elephants and rhino‚Äôs? The Chinese‚Ä¶ This is to make money by the corrupt Government‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ I seriously cannot believe this!!!what a joke of a country. I cannot believe the South African Government is even considering such an appalling move. These beautiful creatures are suffering from trophy hunting and many are at risk from extinction. Please please think again prove to the rest of the world rhat South African has a caring compassionate Government that values the wonderful diverse wildife they are bkessed with. Please please please think again. Barbara Bengry The South African gouverment as we know is absolutely and totally corrupt, and this barbaric persiute of killing our wild animals for human and animal consumption is corruption at its highest!! This gouverment should be ashamed of what they are proposing! This government has No Ethics for any kind of life.

In 2011, IOL reported that there were over 230 000 stray dogs in Cape Town alone! These animals (both cats and dogs) usually rely on humans to survive, whether that be through various feeding schemes or scraps left in the garbage. Removing the human element over the lockdown would cause these strays to suffer as well. But one South African shared an inspiring idea that might help these forgotten and abandoned animals. Nadia Singh shared a post to her Twitter and although the photos don‚Äôt seem to be from South Africa, it is still an inspirational idea to look after abandoned animals during lockdown! ‚ÄúWe are in quarantine but this was the most beautiful thing I saw today, and it deserves to be shared.‚Äù In the photos, plastic bottles have been repurposed for food and water bowls for strays.

It‚Äôs a foolish conclusion, I know, but at the time, the epicenters of the virus were almost exclusively among white and Asian countries and communities. Now, experts believe that the United States, not China, Italy, or Spain, will have the most cases worldwide in about ten days. As it spreads across the country, I want to share seven reasons why African Americans are actually at a much higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. 1. The virus appears to spread quickly in crowded cities. I have seen this with my own eyes in my home borough of Brooklyn and in New York City as a whole: New York City simply was not built for social distancing. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to practice it safely in New York. We live close together, we shop very close together, and we have nearly 9 million residents. African Americans continue to live in the most densely populated cities across the country. Even in smaller to mid-range cities, African Americans are often one of the largest populations of the more crowded city center. 2. African Americans are one of the least likely ethnic groups to be able to work from home. All over the country, as people are ordered to isolate themselves and work from home, millions of African Americans work in professions where this is simply not possible. We work in restaurants. We work at grocery stores. We dominate the staffs of hospitals from the security guard at the front desk to the cleaning crews to the nursing staff. We are sanitary workers, USPS, UPS, and FedEx workers. We are cashiers, food delivery workers, Uber and Lyft drivers. And if we don‚Äôt keep working, our bills don‚Äôt get paid and our families don‚Äôt eat. 3. African Americans working in many of the jobs above are also one of the least likely ethnic groups to have paid sick leave for themselves or paid sick leave for family members. As a consequence, folk have to go to work sick every single day. It‚Äôs dangerous, yes, but people know they will lose their jobs or not be able to pay their bills if they don‚Äôt show up. This is why we must advocate for a universal paid sick leave policy. The United States is one of the only nations in the world to not have it. 4. African Americans are one of the most uninsured and underinsured ethnic groups nationwide. Because of this, folk are slow to go to the doctor and some people just downright don‚Äôt go. They can‚Äôt afford it ‚Äì and have often gone years at a time without visiting the doctor. Of course, during the coronavirus pandemic, this is catastrophic because people will often have symptoms and go weeks before they are tested, leaving themselves in much worse shape as a result. This is not just true of the coronavirus, but if you don‚Äôt have health insurance, or have a horrible policy with outrageous co-pays and deductibles, and you opt not to go to the doctor for respiratory problems or sinus infections, or strep throat ‚Äî all of those health problems would only make the coronavirus worse for you and those around you. This is why we must fight for universal healthcare and a plan like Medicare for All. I hate to sound like a broken record, but this is what the rest of the developed world already has. 5. Doctors routinely under-diagnose African Americans and fail to take health concerns as seriously as they do for white folk. This isn‚Äôt my hunch or a conspiracy theory. Study after study has shown that the medical needs, concerns, requests and reports of African Americans are routinely just not taken as seriously as they should be. It‚Äôs disgusting. But it‚Äôs true ‚Äî and has been for generations. This creates a dangerous cycle of African Americans not feeling like we can trust doctors, then going less as a result, which only compounds the underlying problems. 6. African Americans, pre and post coronavirus, have one of the highest unemployment rates nationwide. Again, this creates a vicious cycle. Because the United States is the only developed nation in the world that ties your health insurance to where you work, meaning that you lose your health insurance when you lose your job, you can directly tie unemployment to a myriad of poor health outcomes. Unemployment will also mean a complete inability to buy things like masks, gloves, disinfectants and more. Again, I have to say it, this is why we must have universal healthcare that is not tied to employment. No other nation in the world ties healthcare or health insurance to the job you do or don‚Äôt have. 7. As we are seeing at Rikers Correctional Facility in New York, jails and prisons are sitting ducks for the coronavirus. Viruses and bacterial infections always spread like wildfire in prisons for so many horrible reasons. First, everybody is forced to live, work, bathe, and eat in close proximity to one another. The very architectural designs of jails and prisons make avoiding close social contact virtually impossible. Beyond that, the medical care offered to incarcerated people is some of the worst in the world. Furthermore, African Americans are not just incarcerated more than other ethnic groups, we also serve in so many of the staff capacities in these facilities. The truth is that I could‚Äôve made a list of dozens of reasons why African Americans are at high risk of contracting the coronavirus, but it goes back to the old saying that in America, when ‚Äúwhite folk sneeze, Black folk get the flu.‚Äù Whatever white folk experience in this country, it almost universally hits African Americans twice as hard. ------ At the end of each story we publish about the coronavirus, we are now sharing the following information: Coronavirus 411 Coronavirus, officially named SARS-CoV-2 but also known as COVID-19, is a novel virus that causes a number of respiratory illnesses, including lung lesions and pneumonia. The virus spreads easily from person to person through the air when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China, has spread to some 172 countries. More than 436,000 people around the world have become infected and more than 19,000 people have died. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency on March 13. Symptoms of COVID-19 can take between two to 14 days to appear. The CDC recommends calling your doctor if you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms, including fever, cough and difficulty breathing. If you also experience persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse and bluish lips or face, seek medical attention immediately. In order to keep yourself and others safe, be sure to wash your hands frequently, practice social distancing and avoid touching your face. The CDC is recommending that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled for the next eight weeks.

His family have reportedly said that Kerzner requested that ‚Äì since we‚Äôre living the age of Corona ‚Äì that his funeral be small and private ‚Äúwith only immediate family in attendance‚Äù. Kerzner‚Äôs family spokesperson, Ian Douglas, told eNCA that Kerzner had a great sense of humour and was a good friend; although he also had a temper but at least you ‚Äúalways knew where you stand with him‚Äù. Kerzner‚Äôs son Brandon posted an official press release in which it says: ‚ÄúThe son of Russian immigrants, Kerzner was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1935. The youngest of four and the only son, Sol was a working class boy from a rough neighbourhood but he would grow up to become one of the most influential entrepreneurs in South Africa‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe complexity and sheer determination of the man is only hinted at by the fact that at the age of 12 Sol played with the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra while, in the same year, he took up boxing ‚Äì initially for reasons of self-defense in the tough Bez Valley suburb where he grew up and, later, as a serious sport. Almost needless to say, by the time he graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand with a degree in accountancy, Kerzner was varsity welterweight champion. ‚ÄúFor someone who lived much of his life in the public eye, Kerzner was a surprisingly private person and although many of his former colleagues and partners will attest to this remarkable man‚Äôs fighting spirit and grit, few knew that Sol also had a softer side.‚Äù The family said: ‚ÄúIn spite of his international celebrity status and the demands of maintaining a massive business reputation, Sol always remained an intensely family-oriented person.‚Äù Andrea, his daughter, said: ‚ÄúDad taught us family values ‚Äî no matter how busy he was, he always made time for us, his family. He would take a call from any one of us in the middle of an important meeting or fly half-way across the world to get to a grandchild‚Äôs birthday party. For Dad, his family were everything, his joy.‚Äù According to Sun International, the company Kerzner founded ‚Äì he was a visionary and a pioneer. The company paid tribute to Kerzner in a statement late on Saturday evening. Kerzner was a legend in South Africa and known in many parts of the world where he created five- and six-star luxury resorts in idyllic locations. He also had a high profile marriage to former Miss World Anneline Kriel. The accountant-turned-hotelier‚Äôs career spanned six decades in which he created three of the world‚Äôs most successful hotel companies, and reinvented luxury travel. It was during a helicopter trip in 1978 that Kerzner flew over the Pilanesberg and fell in love with the land that was to become Sun City (opening on 7 December 1979).  ‚ÄúSun City would be instrumental in arming him with the ‚Äútemplate‚Äù he needed to bring his fantasy resorts and pleasure parks to life‚Ä¶‚Äù said Sun International. The company described Kerzner as a ‚Äúcharismatic risk taker‚Äù who established his name through a suite of upmarket Durban hotels ‚Äì including South Africa‚Äôs first five-star hotel, The Beverley Hills, and later the Elangeni and Maharani. ‚ÄúIn 1969, just seven years after opening his first hotel and dinner club in downtown Durban, he formed a partnership with South African Breweries to create the Southern Sun group of hotels and casinos,‚Äù said the tribute. ‚ÄúDue to the rigid apartheid gaming laws, he was forced to look to other African countries and in 1972, he built Botswana‚Äôs five-star Chobe Game Lodge ‚Äì where Elizabeth Taylor and Sir Richard Burton spontaneously tied the knot on what was supposed to be a two-day visit to the luxury bush retreat. ‚ÄúIn the mid-70s, when foreign investment in South Africa had reached an all-time high, Kerzner broke into the Mauritian market, opening the five-star Le Saint G√©ran Resort in 1975. Always one step ahead of the game, Kerzner‚Äôs move proved to be lucrative and gave Southern Sun the financial boost it needed for his ‚Äúbreakout development‚Äù. ‚ÄúBack in South Africa, negotiations with the tribal council of Bophuthatswana would turn in his favour and, once the gaming licence was in place, Sun City development began.‚Äù He was also a ‚Äúrule-breaking pioneer‚Äù, said Sun International, whose Sun City helped him push boundaries. ‚ÄúAlthough long hours and a ‚Äújet-setting lifestyle‚Äù triggered a near-fatal heart attack in 1980, Kerzner was back at work two weeks later to begin plans on the three-star Aloe Ridge hotel, as well as on a new casino-resort on South Africa‚Äôs majestic Wild Coast,‚Äù said Sun International. His Sun City stage seated 6,000 and ‚Äì despite boycotts by the international community, Sun City attracted Dolly Parton, Eric Clapton, Sting, Queen, Elton John, Liberace, Michael Jackson, Shirley Bassey, The Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, and Liza Minnelli, to name a few. He bolstered Sun City‚Äôs resort appeal with the addition of an 18-hole golf course, designed by his long-time friend and golfing legend Gary Player. As recorded in the ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You‚Äù commercial, Sun City encapsulated the hedonistic spirit of the ‚Äô80s, replete with a casino and heavyweight boxing bouts. In 1983 Kerzner launched Sun International, and in ‚Äô84 he listed it on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Kerzner then raised the capital to fund Sun City‚Äôs first five-star hotel ‚Äì the R50-million Cascades. That year, Sun International opened Lesotho Sun, and ‚Äì as gaming licenses became available ‚Äì he opened in other ‚Äòhomelands‚Äô including the Morula Sun, Fish River Sun and more. Next was The Palace of the Lost City‚Ä¶ which oozed African opulence. Kerzner‚Äôs team were trained to deliver excellence and blow the ‚Äúcustomer away by giving them an experience ahead of what they expect.‚Äù According to Sun International, Kerzner was committed to boosting the country‚Äôs employment, and at a private meeting held in Johannesburg two weeks after Nelson Mandela‚Äôs release from prison, the future statesman lauded the hotelier for his contribution, when he said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great that a young Jewish man is creating thousands of jobs out in the African countryside.‚Äù In 1995, Kerzner was given the honour of hosting Mandela‚Äôs presidential inauguration reception at Sun City. Kerzner‚Äôs overseas expansion included the Atlantis resort in The Bahamas, Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut, USA, and more. In 2002 Kerzner launched his second luxury resort collection, One&Only Resorts, with plans to develop properties in the Middle East, Mexico, Morocco, Hayman Island (Australia), the Maldives and South Africa. With success, sadly came sacrifice. During research for one of his tourist destinations in October 2006, his eldest son Howard (‚ÄòButch‚Äô) who was a chief executive of the company, died in a helicopter crash in the Dominican Republic. Sun International said ‚Äúthis was a devastating blow for Kerzner ‚Äì ‚Äòthe company would never become a family business‚Äô.‚Äù Sun International said: ‚ÄúIn 2008, as part of a massive US$1.5-billion joint-venture with the Dubai-based Istithmar World, Kerzner honoured his son‚Äôs legacy with the opening of Atlantis The Palm ‚Äì a 1 539-room hotel comprising a seven-hectare waterpark on Dubai‚Äôs prestigious Palm Jumeirah Island. ‚ÄúTo open his Dubai showstopper, Kerzner spent US$20 million ‚Äì the largest amount ever spent on a hotel launch ‚Äì for an evening that included impromptu performances by friends Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Natalie Cole, as well as a fireworks display by the company that lit up the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. In a visual ode to Butch, Kerzner didn‚Äôt skimp on the details!‚Äù In 2009, Kerzner made his South African comeback ‚Äì in time for the 2010 Soccer World Cup -with the opening of the six-star One&Only hotel at Cape Town‚Äôs V&A Waterfront. That year Kerzner was announced on Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs honours List and was awarded the Insignia of Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George for his contribution to business and the community of The Bahamas. Kerzner‚Äôs last contribution to the resort industry was bringing Atlantic to the South China Sea. Sun International said: ‚ÄúHow do you define the legacy of a stalwart who has built a cross-continental empire of hotels, casinos and resorts? With the many triumphs, there were tragedies along the way, but these never deterred a man who was destined to make his mark. ‚ÄúKerzner‚Äôs journey may sound like a rags-to-riches tale, but it really is the story of a man who built a legacy on humble beginnings. As the youngest of four children of Russian immigrants, Sol was born in the modest suburb of Doornfontein in 1935. His parents worked tirelessly selling fruit and vegetables in Johannesburg, and eventually saved enough money to open a small guesthouse in Durban.‚Äù The guesthouse inspired Kerzner‚Äôs interest in the hotel business. ‚ÄúHe may have loved the extravagance and fanfare that came with the job, but Kerzner also adored his family and was a doting father and grandfather. Although Butch‚Äôs death left an irreplaceable void in his life, his four other children have leveraged their father‚Äôs legacy and succeeded in their respective professions and personal pursuits,‚Äù said Sun International. Just last year, Kerzner received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2019 International Hotel Investment Forum in Berlin for his contribution to the hotel and casino industry. As one of the greatest hoteliers of our time. ‚ÄúHe will go down in history as one of the most influential self-made entrepreneurs that South Africa has ever produced ‚Äì one that Forbes Africa once nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Five-Star Millionaire‚Äù,‚Äù said Sun International. ‚ÄúWhen you think of the monumental mark that Kerzner made on the industry, you could call him a ‚Äútrailblazer‚Äù, ‚Äúrain-maker‚Äù and ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù. He dined with dignitaries and shook hands with sheikhs. He entertained presidents and fluttered with Hollywood celebrities. But beyond the fancy titles and accolades, Kerzner was a heroic hotelier, who, in the pursuit of perfection, leaves a legacy that is inherent in the tapestry of hotels he created; a collection of dreamy developments that are synonymous with decadence, luxury, vision and success. ‚ÄúPerhaps the most befitting title is the one he inherited after founding Southern Sun in 1969. Right from the start, Kerzner aimed for the moon and reached the sun time and time again. What made the ‚ÄúSun King‚Äù so iconic is that he did it with so much passion and soul.‚Äù Kerzner once said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not all about the titles, how much money you would have made or what you would have gotten from it. It‚Äôs about having some fun, being able to create things‚Ä¶‚Äù Sol is survived by his children Andrea, Beverley, Brandon and Chantal and 10 grandchildren. A public memorial will reportedly be held at a later stage.

South Africa‚Äôs benchmark stock index plummeted the most on record after president Cyril Ramaphosa‚Äôs declaration of a national state of disaster over the coronavirus outbreak stoked investor concern about its impact on an already fragile economy, Bloomberg reported. The president announced tough measures Sunday to stem the spread of the virus locally, including halting flights and shutting schools, and said the government was finalizing a crisis package. In his weekly open letter to South Africa on Monday (16 March), president Cyril Ramaphosa warned that the coronavirus will be extremely disruptive and will likely cause damage to the economy. ‚ÄúWe have to address the inevitable economic fallout. We must expect a decline in exports, a drop in tourist arrivals and a severe impact on production, business viability and job creation and retention,‚Äù he said. An emergency cut in the US Federal Reserve rate, as well as those by other central banks to try to stem the impact of the virus, only accelerated the sell-off sweeping through global equities. The FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index sank 12%, before recovering somewhat to trade at 40,819 (-7.60%) points. ‚ÄúThe JSE is taking cues from global markets which will also be reacting to the US Fed cut that only increased fear,‚Äù Nolwandle Mthombeni, an analyst at Mergence Investment Managers, toldBloomberg. ‚ÄúThere additionally will be some local investors worried about our economy after the president‚Äôs speech last night.‚Äù Capitec co-founder, Michiel le Roux, who at the start of last week was still listed among the world‚Äôs billionaires with a net worth of $1.1 billion, has now fallen off the global ranking, as a result of the crash. Shares in Capitec, like all other stocks on the JSE, fell again sharply on Monday (16 March), down more than 6% on the day.  Le Roux is not the only South African multi-millionaire feeling the effects of the spreading virus. After the initial market crash on 9 March ‚Äì the first major global market panic about the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äì South Africa‚Äôs then-five billionaires lost R6 billion in their collective net worth, according to Forbes. By the end of the week, on another major market dip, they lost a further R14 billion. By Monday, 16 March, as markets once again crumbled as the coronavirus panic continued to outplay various governments‚Äô rate cuts and stimulus packages to counter the crash, the four remaining South African billionaires saw their combined net worth fall by a further R8.2 billion. Because Forbes‚Äô tracking shows daily changes, it is difficult to gauge the overall impact of the market crash on billionaires‚Äô net worth every day. Taking daily ups and downs into account over the last week, however, we can see South Africa‚Äôs five richest people have seen their collective net worth decline by more than $1.8 billion (R30 billion). The table below, however, shows how South Africa‚Äôs richest have seen their wealth change over the last week alone.

Alicia Clarke said exactly a week ago she went for a quick run outside her south city home. When she came back, she noticed her shoes had been moved to a different spot and her cell phone was gone. From there, she used Find My iPhone to search for it. The location said it was on her property grid. She used her work phone to call it. ‚ÄúI open my back door to call it and I hear it in my neighbor‚Äôs backyard behind me,‚Äù Clarke said. Clarke said she hopped the fence to get it and jumped back over to her yard. Another neighbor yelled out to her and said, ‚ÄúHey, I told him, ‚ÄòI know you did this and I‚Äôm calling the police!‚Äô‚Äù Clarke said that‚Äôs when the 6-foot teen jumped the fence and tackled her. ‚ÄúHe knocked me down, pulling my hair, kicking,‚Äù she recalled. Before he ran off, she said he grabbed her personal cell phone again. She used her work phone to call police. ‚ÄúI am on the phone with St. Louis police dispatch, making my way to my backdoor, when he comes back with a weapon. He is on top of me. There was blood everywhere. I was literally fighting for my life at that point,‚Äù she told 5 On Your Side. Clarke said as he was on her back, he stabbed her in the head and face with a metal rod. She was able to get the weapon out of his hand and ran inside. He ran away again, taking her second cell phone this time. Police arrested the teen on charges of first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary and third-degree assault. Clarke thought the fight was over. But when she went to juvenile court a few days later, she learned his case was dismissed. ‚ÄúThe most hurtful thing of all of this, is the dropped charges. That was much more hurtful than the physical assault,‚Äù Clarke said. A juvenile court official said a staff attorney dropped the case before even going to the judge. The courts weren‚Äôt able to comment specifically on this incident, since it involves a juvenile. Clarke said she was told her accused attacker was found incompetent to aid in his own defense because he has an IQ of 49. A spokeswoman said in general, circumstances like these leave the court with few options when it comes to a criminal case. ‚ÄúIn those instances, we work with child guardian and agencies to help with services outside the court system,‚Äù 5 On Your Side was told. As for the victim, they said they offer victim services. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not feeling safe and honestly feeling like I‚Äôve been failed by the system,‚Äù Clarke said. She believes there needs to be a change. ‚ÄúThis is going to happen again, and that‚Äôs my number one priority that it doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said. Another neighbor who didn‚Äôt want to go on camera said the teen has also broken into her home and believes he needs to be held accountable. Clarke said the teen has broken into her car three times, but this has been the worst of it. She has a great support system, so she isn‚Äôt forced to continue living where she said she was attacked. But she wants to help others and send a message to the city that more needs to be done. More via Woman Brutally Attacked by Somali Refugee Says Authorities Let Him Go‚Ä¶ In a Feb. 20 Facebook post, Andrea Clarke Flatley, who identified herself as Alicia Clarke‚Äôs sister, described the attack in more detail and included photographs. She added that her sister needed staples in her head for the stab wounds inflicted by a screwdriver, suffered a puncture wound and share more details about what officials allegedly told them. The post also included what looked like a screen grab of the police incident report. She identified the neighbor as ‚ÄúHassan,‚Äù a 6-foot-0, 175-pound Somali refugee who she said has broken into Alicia Clarke‚Äôs car three times. According to Andrea Clarke, each incident had been reported to the police. ‚ÄúOn arrival, we learned from that same patient advocate that Hassan‚Äôs IQ is 49,‚Äù the post reads. ‚ÄúThis makes him incompetent to aid in his own defense, therefore all charges were formally dismissed by the prosecutor, Sakina Ahmad.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe never entered a courtroom, saw a judge, nothing. Hassan was able to go home with a family member. He likely left the building as a free person before we even learned all the above information.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven if Alicia had been killed, the outcome would be the same‚Äù ‚ÄúThe prosecutor sympathized with our frustration and explained that because he is a mentally handicapped, juvenile refugee, every safeguard available is to his benefit and to Alicia‚Äôs detriment. She went on to tell us, verbatim, that even if Alicia had been killed, the outcome would be the same and that this case would be dismissed.‚Äù The Facebook post has been shared nearly 8,000 times and generated nearly 4,000 comments. An unidentified court official told KSDK that no one could comment on the case since it involved a juvenile. An email from Pluralist to the Missouri State Circuit Attorney‚Äôs office in St. Louis did not receive an immediate reply. A phone call to the office received a busy signal. Flatley went on to say that the prosecutor‚Äôs office advised Clarke to get a restraining order, which she did the day after the attack. However, if the neighbor violates the restraining order, the cycle of reporting and release will be repeated, they were told. h/t Refugee Resettlement Watch (Source: ksdk.com)","none","none",0,0,0,0

Secrets Revealed highlights some of the most exciting pieces of the museum's storage ""closet.""For one weekend only, visitors can get a close-up look inside the cockpit of an SR-71 ""Blackbird, view rarely seen artifacts, photos and manuals and meet with more than 20 former SR-71 and U-2 pilots and crew members. ""Some of the museum artifacts that you can see that aren't normally out include an SR-71 pressure suit and the helmet that goes with it,"" says Doug Lantry, museum historian. ""Some of the food that the pilots ate - it's tube food, liquefied food. You can also see some of the high-tech cameras used in the SR-71 and also one of the detachable noses from the airplane. Not many people know that they could just interchange the noses on these airplanes to get different effects from different equipment."" Among the special guest speakers is Col. (Ret.) Merryl Tengesdal, the first and only African American woman U-2 pilot. During her career, Tengesdal flew more than 300 combat hours from Afghanistan to the Horn of Africa. In total, she logged more than 3,400 flight hours and more than 330 combat hours. ""It's a difficult airplane to fly and so you have to be a pretty great pilot even to get there,"" explains Lantry. ""She has got a wealth of experience and a lot of stories to tell and she's a fascinating individual to talk to."" She'll discuss her experiences beside a U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" reconnaissance ""spy"" plane on March 7 from 10-11:30 a.m. and 2-3:30 p.m. ""I have seen the curvature of the Earth,"" Tengesdal said during a 2015 Air Force interview. ""I have seen sights most people will never see. Flying at more than 70,000 feet is really beautiful and peaceful. I enjoy the quiet, hearing myself breathing, and the hum of the engine. I never take it for granted.""    Tengesdal says she enjoys a challenge, like landing the U-2, which has just two wheels. She began flying with the Navy's SH-60B Seahawk helicopter before achieving a dream to ""fly higher"" when she was cross-commissioned into the Air Force in 2004 and began training on the U-2.

The arresting officers found two boxes of surgical gloves, a mask and three boxes containing human placentas with names on them. Police spokesperson Constable Bontle Rahatji confirmed the freak incident ‚ÄúMembers were patrolling the Rosslyn on-ramp to the N4 when they spotted a suspicious green Peugeot vehicle on the side of the road,‚Äù She explained that the male nurse was acting suspiciously and had to be flagged down. He was discovered allegedly moving ‚Äúthings‚Äù from the boot to the vehicle‚Äôs front seat. ‚ÄúThey checked the bonnet but could not find anything until they checked on the front passenger seat,‚Äù Rahatji said. The officers then found the three boxes containing human placentas with names on them. ‚ÄúWhen asked what he was doing with the human placentas, he said he was selling them to sangomas for R3 000,‚Äù Rahatji said a nurse at the George Mukhari Hospital‚Äù. The 36-year-old nurse will appear in the Pretoria magistrate‚Äôs court soon. The very controversial use of human organs for ritualistic and ‚Äòhealing‚Äô purposes by sangomas is not a new feat. Some people have even resorted to cold blooded murder in order to harvest the human organs and make a quick sells to eager sangomas. According to some traditional medicine practitioners, female geni_tals and placentas are used to counter infertility and bring good luck. The placenta is considered as the afterbirth and is usually disposed of and then incinerated after the process hence the nurse had unchecked access to the organs. No wonder the nurse risked his job for a quick jackpot.

The 25-year-old student misses his sister and brother. He misses his mother, and his friends 5,000 miles away. Since late January, Girma has been trapped in Wuhan, China, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Girma studies electrical engineering at Hubei University of Technology, along the Xunsi River, near the middle of Wuhan. He‚Äôs also an Ethiopian citizen, and like hundreds of other Ethiopian college students studying in China, he has not been evacuated. Instead, he‚Äôs spent the past two months at the heart of a pandemic that has now spread to six continents. ‚ÄúI mostly spend my time watching movies on Netflix,‚Äù Girma told VOA. ‚ÄúI try to read, but it‚Äôs more depressing at a time like this. My mind is numb right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄòIt is now messing with our minds‚Äô China‚Äôs efforts to curb the spread of the disease have produced dramatic results. After weeks of surging cases, Beijing reported no new local infections March 19. Now, imported cases, from Chinese returning from overseas, pose the gravest risk. However, containing the outbreak has required an aggressive response, particularly in Wuhan, where travel in and out of the city has been blocked, and sick patients not needing hospitalization have been separated from their families in isolation shelters. Girma and other foreign students stuck in Wuhan have been told it will be until at least mid-April before travel restrictions are eased. That‚Äôs little comfort to those who have felt trapped for months. ‚ÄúIt is now messing with our minds,‚Äù Girma told VOA via WhatsApp. ‚ÄúFor some, it is getting worse psychologically. Some of them even don‚Äôt have friends and are separated from them, so they are lonely and depressed,‚Äù he added. Government responses Girma credits the Chinese government with taking decisive action to save people‚Äôs lives. ‚ÄúFor the time being from China,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe Chinese government is doing its best and it is doing its best for its citizens who need monitoring and assistance due to the virus.‚Äù He faults the Ethiopian government, though, for not doing more to assist its citizens in Wuhan. In early March, some African countries ‚Äî but not Ethiopia ‚Äî evacuated their citizens as the virus began to spread rapidly in Hubei province. Instead, the Ethiopian government began providing students in Hubei a two-month $400 allowance to buy food and necessities, Girma said. Ethiopia‚Äôs ambassador to China, Teshome Toga Chanaka, helped coordinate a task force with the student union in Wuhan. ‚ÄúThe situation was very scary and worrisome given the nature of the virus. We therefore focused on protection and care for them where they are,‚Äù Chanaka said. According to Girma, though, only about half of 300 students budgeted had received the stipend several weeks later. Even now, Girma and other students in Wuhan have identified at least 66 Ethiopians who have not received the payments. ‚ÄúEveryone is begging for a response right now,‚Äù Girma said. Students have been receiving aid, Chanaka said, but the Ethiopian government didn‚Äôt have accurate information for all its citizens. ‚ÄúThe Ethiopian Embassy in Beijing has been processing the transfer based on the address and bank account of each student,‚Äù Chanaka said. ‚ÄúIn the process, we have faced the problem of getting the correct address and account number for about 50 students.‚Äù Longing for home Girma is the eldest of three children. His 19-year-old sister and 21-year-old brother live in Addis Ababa, along with their mother. Three months ago, Girma‚Äôs father died. Girma could not return home because he feared losing his student visa. When he finally returns home, he plans to eat injera, Ethiopia's national dish, ‚Äúnonstop‚Äù and talk to his mother around the clock. For now, he waits alone in his off-campus apartment, where, he figures, he has a better chance of leaving than his classmates on campus. As he waits, he‚Äôs seen the threat spread back home. As of March 27, Ethiopia had 16 confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 3,700 cases across Africa.

Staff writer Zion, an African penguin chick, was born at Audubon Aquarium of the Americas on Feb. 17, 2020. The Audubon Aquarium of the Americas introduced a special new addition Tuesday via Facebook Live ‚Äî a month-old African penguin chick named Zion. Audubon staff named the penguin after New Orleans Pelicans power forward Zion Williamson, who recently made headlines when he announced March 13 that he'd cover the salaries of Smoothie King Center workers for 30 days after NBA games were put on hold. The penguin chick was born on Feb. 17 after his egg was incubated for 39 days. His mother Hubig and father Ocio raised him for the first 11 days, but after that he needed human care, an intensive process in which he'll be fed and looked after for two months before he begins to be introduced to the rest of the aquarium's penguins.  African penguins are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan, an effort to oversee the management of the species in captivity while also helping with its conservation in the wild. The species had 141,000 breeding pairs in 1956 and now only has around 25,000, due to habitat destruction, overfishing and oil spills. The Facebook Live video was part of the Audubon Nature Institute's new daily social media livestreams, which it announced it would do last week after its facilities closed to the public due to coronavirus. Audubon and the Pelicans have an ongoing partnership. The NBA team sponsors a wetlands exhibit at the Audubon Zoo called Pelicans' Nest. Residents can adopt one of the aquarium's African penguins by donating money to help fund their care.  Daily livestreaming sessions include interactive videos, virtual tours of facilities online quizzes and more.

Thomas and Flaurience Sengstacke chronicled what life was like for two young, African American women traveling abroad. Published in the pages of the Chicago Defender, a weekly newspaper published by their uncle Robert Sengstacke Abbott, the cousins‚Äô columns regaled readers with tales of the duo‚Äôs travels throughout Europe, as recounted in some 20 articles penned between July 1931 and August 1932. They experienced highs, like watching the indelible Josephine Baker perform in Paris, and lows, including an encounter with racism on an Italian train ride. The pair‚Äôs words bore auspicious warning, particularly as they witnessed the rise of ‚Äúoppression and paranoia‚Äù during the dying days of Germany‚Äôs Weimar Republic. By sharing stories with the largely black readership of the Defender, the cousins sparked remembrance of fond memories among those who had similarly traveled abroad and provided an escapist fantasy for those who had ‚Äúnot yet seen the grandeur that is Europe.‚Äù The Defender, like other black newspapers at the time, used overseas correspondents to report on news, encouraging those traveling abroad as performers, tourists and students to report on their experiences. Rather than focusing exclusively on local or domestic issues, the publication hoped to establish African Americans‚Äô presence on the world stage. Hilary Mac Austin, author of the journal article ‚ÄúThe Defender Brings You the World,‚Äù writes that this coverage ‚Äúwas an essential element in the cosmopolitan identity‚Äù of the black elite. The cousins‚Äô European adventures signaled to readers that grand tours of Europe weren‚Äôt limited to upper-class white women, but were also accessible to African American travelers. According to Ethan Michaeli‚Äôs The Defender: How the Legendary Black Newspaper Changed America, the newspaper catered to a diverse audience of laborers, maids, students, churchgoers, theatergoers, business owners and unemployed individuals affected by the Great Depression. It boasted an array of notable advertisers, including Madam C.J. Walker, one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest African American entrepreneurs, and despite its Chicago-centric title, reached a widespread audience. Abbott shrewdly recruited Pullman porters to supplement their income by distributing the Defender on trains traveling throughout the United States and signing up new subscribers. Arguably the most important aspect of the paper‚Äôs legacy was its role in the Great Migration. Because the Defender encouraged African Americans to leave the South and move north for better occupational opportunities, many white Southerners considered it dangerously radical and ‚Äúsought to prohibit its sale and distribution.‚Äù In Meridian, Mississippi, the police chief attempted to confiscate all copies of the newspapers but was thwarted when the ‚Äúpaper sold out on the day it arrived.‚Äù Copies were exchanged ‚Äúuntil they disintegrated,‚Äù according to Michaeli. By 1916, the Defender had become the best-selling black newspaper in the United States. At its height during World War I, writes Michaeli, the publication was considered the ‚Äúking of the weeklies.‚Äù Adds the author, ‚ÄúThe Defender was the giant ‚Ä¶ in terms of circulation and national reach, selling as many copies every week as all of the ten other black newspapers combined.‚Äù In 1921, the paper sold more than 280,000 weekly copies; nine years later, in the midst of the Great Depression, the Defender remained relatively robust, selling an average of 110,000 weekly copies. Abbott financed Thomas and Sengstacke‚Äôs European vacation as a generous gift marking their graduation from Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville, in 1930. Both 24 years old at the start of the trip, the duo traversed Italy, Sweden, Denmark, England, France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Germany, relaying news from abroad in joint dispatches or in Thomas‚Äô solo column, ‚ÄúA Little About Everything.‚Äù The cousins‚Äô journey began on a positive note. Setting sail on July 17, 1931, the young women reported that ‚Äúthere was not an inch of prejudice‚Äù aboard the S.S. Conte Biancamano. ‚ÄúEveryone was friendly,‚Äù the pair added. Thomas and Sengstacke spent the majority of their year in Germany with relatives. Reflecting on the experience, they wrote, mirroring their description of their eastbound sea journey, ‚ÄúThere were no traces of cruelty or prejudice seen the whole time we were there.‚Äù The cousins acknowledged that ‚ÄúWe were stared at more in Germany than in any other country,‚Äù but explained, ‚ÄúWe soon found that the stare was a friendly and curious stare, and only typical of those parts of Germany where the darker people seldom visit.‚Äù While visiting family in Bremen, the pair even reported, ‚ÄúEveryone wanted to dance with us and did their best to make things pleasant for us.‚Äù According to the duo, the Germans they encountered were both well-informed on and appalled by the treatment of African Americans in the United States. ‚ÄúWe were asked many times about the Race problem,‚Äù the cousins wrote. ‚ÄúOne fellow wanted to know why Negroes stayed in America and did not go to countries where they treat people like they are human beings.‚Äù One of the most poignant moments detailed in Thomas and Sengstacke‚Äôs missives reflects the pervasive reach of Jim Crow. In 1931, the cousins, accompanied by a group of black students from Virginia‚Äôs Hampton Institute, sat down to dine on a train from Florence to Venice. Before they could order, however, a group of white college students from Texas approached the table and said, ‚ÄúYou have our seats; we ordered these.‚Äù The cousins and their companions promptly moved, only to realize they were the butt of a joke when the Texans ‚Äúbegan laughing and saying unpleasant things.‚Äù Dismay turned into indignation, and as Thomas and Sengstacke later recounted, ‚Äú[W]e reported them to the head man, who asked them to get up and get out of the dining car or take other seats. And were they angry!‚Äù The dining car incident served as a prelude to the travelers‚Äô next encounter with the ‚Äúpoor little Texans,‚Äù who were reportedly ‚Äúshocked‚Äù to see the group relaxing in Venice‚Äôs St. Mark‚Äôs Square. One white student said, ‚ÄúWe do not allow them to do that in Texas.‚Äù In response, a Hampton student retorted, ‚ÄúRemember, brother, you are not in Texas.‚Äù The cousins recorded the incidents in a column sub-titled ‚ÄúA familiar act in a strange setting.‚Äù *** Most of the cousins‚Äô Defender dispatches centered on more traditional tourist fare, including trips to the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the ruins of Pompeii, the Tower of London, Sweden‚Äôs Malm√∂ Castle, the Eiffel Tower and many other sites. Others detailed such topics as obtaining a passport and visas; saving money; using traveler‚Äôs checks and letters of credits; coping with sea sickness; and selecting a guide or interpreter (not on the streets!). Thomas and Sengstacke assured readers that though they both spoke a little German and French, they added that they had no need to learn more than a few key words in each destination‚Äôs respective language. While in London, where they also visited the British Museum, they wrote, ‚ÄúEvery afternoon and evening we would either sit in Hyde Park, which was right across the street from our hotel and listen to the band concert, or sit near the window in our hotel and enjoy the program just the same.‚Äù In Copenhagen, the pair had ‚Äúthe great pleasure of seeing and hearing the great actress of Paris, Josephine Baker, and she was good!‚Äù Performing in a packed theater, Baker ‚Äîan American expatriate who won fame in 1920s France with her sensual jazz routines‚Äîenthralled the cousins with her ‚Äúapparels, her charming manners, her individual dances and acts. ‚Ä¶ She did most of her speaking and singing in French and German. She was the talk of the town.‚Äù Later, during a separate trip to Paris, Thomas and Sengstacke attended yet another Baker show. Assessing the state of the French capital‚Äôs overall culture, they noted that many of the city‚Äôs cabarets were ‚Äúowned and operated by Negroes and [staffed with] many Negro orchestras and entertainers.‚Äù *** The cousins‚Äô initial impression of Germany as a tolerant, progressive nation belied the changing tides on the horizon. While visiting the town of Heidelberg, for instance, Thomas and Sengstacke saw a bridge and castle engulfed in flames as part of a celebration of German independence: ‚ÄúEverything was in an uproar as the famous Hitlerites were staging a political scene. On a lofty hill behind the castle one got a glimpse of an electric sign being flashed on and off and each time the sign was lighted with Hitlerite colors [the crowd] would yell, ‚ÄòHeil Hitler.‚Äô‚Äù Rather than dwelling on this disturbing scene, the pair left Heidelberg, taking a trip down the Rhine to Cologne. When Sengstacke returned to Germany to visit relatives in 1936, she reported back to U.S.-based family members that ‚Äúthe atmosphere had changed from one of warmth and openness to oppression and paranoia.‚Äù Photographs of a maternal ancestor named Elizabeth Sengstacke Boedeker, as well as a portrait of Abbott, founder and publisher of the Defender, had been taken down from where they ‚Äúhad hung proudly in their parlor‚Äù due to their subjects‚Äô ‚Äúdistinctly African complexion.‚Äù Additionally, Sengstacke stated, because ‚Äúthe oldest of these cousins were just one-quarter African, ‚Ä¶ under the Nuremberg Laws of racial purity passed the previous year, even that ancestry had become a dangerous liability. Deemed ‚Äúnon-Aryans,‚Äù these relatives now fell under the purview of government officials who removed the younger family members from school, fired the adults from their jobs, cut their food rations, and even blocked them from mundane activities like wearing a brown shirt, part of the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary units. Family members asked Sengstacke to tell relatives in Chicago to stop sending issues of the Defender because of its unflattering comments about Germany. *** The cousins‚Äô final column, titled ‚ÄúAmerica Welcomes Travelers at End of World Trip,‚Äù described their return voyage on the S.S. Bremen, which docked in New York City on August 27, 1932. They concluded: [W]e will never be able to express enough gratitude to the giver. The trip was quite an inspiration that no human being can take from us regardless of how hard he tries. It is something that we will take with us to our graves‚Äîit is something that we can amuse ourselves with while alone; it is more than a good friend would be to use because it will stay with us always. To the Defender‚Äôs readers, they said: [W]e hope that you have enjoyed our articles and that some day you too may be able to cover the same trip and more, and write up your experiences for others to read and profit by in years to come. You can really see America from a different angle after such a trip is taken. Today, travel groups such as Black & Abroad, or individual black bloggers like Oneika the Traveller, continue the tradition pioneered by Thomas and Sengstacke, offering African American readers tips on how to travel cheaply, take solo trips, decide which tourist sites to visit and where to dine. Tours like Black Paris, meanwhile, literally find tourists tracing the footsteps of black luminaries including Baker, Langston Hughes, James Baldwin and Richard Wright. Unlike Thomas and Sengstacke, today‚Äôs travel bloggers often finance their own adventures. Still, the cousins‚Äô modern counterparts remain equally committed to encouraging other black travelers to experience the joys of visiting other countries as inexpensively and as safely as possible.

The pandemic ""poses an existential threat to the economies of African countries,"" Abiy's office said in a statement, adding that Ethiopia was ""working closely with other African countries"" in preparing the aid request. The heavy debt burdens of many African countries leave them ill-equipped to respond to pandemic-related economic shocks, as the cost of servicing debt exceeds many countries' health budgets, the statement said. ""Just as the virus knows no borders, our responses should also know no borders,"" it said. Saudi Arabia, which currently presides over the G20, last week called for a ""virtual"" summit to coordinate an international response to the coronavirus crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron's office said Monday that he had spoken by telephone with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and that the two leaders agreed on the need for emergency talks. After lagging behind the global curve for coronavirus infections and deaths, Africa has seen a rise in cases in recent days. As of Monday night, there were 1,654 reported cases across 43 African countries resulting in 52 deaths, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts warn that the coronavirus could quickly overwhelm weak African health systems. African economies will also be vulnerable in the face of ""a dramatic decline in exports, disruption of global chains, and the sudden drying up of travel and tourism,"" Abiy's statement said. The proposed $150-billion (138-billion-euro) aid package could include budgetary support from the World Bank and crisis financing from the International Monetary Fund, the statement said. To alleviate African debt burdens, Abiy proposed that interest payments on government loans ""should be written off"" and that ""part of the debt of low-income countries should be written off."" The IMF reported last year that seven African countries were in debt distress and that nine, including Ethiopia, were ""at high risk of debt distress."" Abiy's proposal comes one day after African finance ministers called for $100 billion in ""immediate emergency economic stimulus"" including the waiver of debt interest payments. Without a coordinated aid effort for the continent, the coronavirus ""will have major and adverse implications on African economies and the society at large,"" according to a statement from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.

The complaints relate to allegations of misleading representation to drivers immediately after they are involved in an accident. Some towing companies seem to take advantage of the state of shock and confusion that a driver experiences just after being involved in an accident, said the Ombudsman, Magauta Mphahlele. ‚ÄúSome of these companies have refused to cooperate with our office to resolve the complaints and as a result we have referred them to the National Consumer Commission for possible further investigation,‚Äù said Mphahlele. The modus operandi reported to the CGSO states that the towing operator pretends to call the driver‚Äôs insurer to confirm authorisation for the specific towing company to tow away the car, or they promise to help with claims and accident assessments. When the driver later contacts their insurer, they are advised that no authorisation was provided nor was there any call logged to seek authorisation. It is alleged that the towing company then charges the driver for storage and towing fees which were not previously disclosed, and refuse to release the car if the driver does not pay up. Drivers have also complained that the towing companies also strip and vandalize the vehicles while it is said that the vehicles are in the ‚Äúcare‚Äù of their premises. Because of the conduct described above, drivers have reported that they are dispossessed of their vehicles when they are not able to settle the exorbitant amounts charged for towing, salvage and storage. The CGSO advised consumers to use towing companies that are authorized by their insurers or alternatively consider the following guidelines before concluding an agreement with any towing service company: If you are insured, make sure you understand the benefits of your policy, the claims procedure as well as their guidelines on what to do when involved in an accident; Read: Top 10 best-selling bakkies in South Africa right now ‚Äì with prices Comments section policy:  ","none","none",0,0,0,0

Credit: Abubakar Shehu. Last November, I went to the police headquarters in Niger state to seek approval for a protest. The rally for which I hoped to get formal permission and security was against sexual and gender-based violence. It was being coordinated by writer Hassana Maina and had been convened by social development worker Fakhrriyyah Hashim who, a few months earlier, had coined the hashtag #ArewaMeToo. Arewa is the Hausa word for ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù; #ArewaMeToo is northern Nigeria‚Äôs #MeToo movement. As was explained in the letter I was to deliver to the police, the planned protest was to be held across eight states in northern Nigeria. Its purpose was to raise awareness of gender-based violence and call on those states‚Äô governments to adopt the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act. Among other things, that bill broadens the definition of rape from just penile penetration. It was passed at the national level in 2015 but has only been domesticated so far by three of Nigeria‚Äôs nineteen northern states. ‚ÄúSo, you people want to do a protest about rape?‚Äù said the first police officer to whom I explained this request. ‚ÄúWhat of men too? Don‚Äôt they suffer it too?‚Äù ‚ÄúActually, the word used in our letter is ‚Äòpersons‚Äô,‚Äù I clarified. He proceeded with a long monologue on how fruitless our actions would be. ‚ÄúYour protest is not going to achieve anything,‚Äù he said finally in conclusion. ‚ÄúWe can try,‚Äù I offered. ‚ÄúI like that word ‚Äòtry‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt means you know you are wasting your time.‚Äù Eventually, he led me to a bigger office where elaborate portraits of the national president and state governor hung on the walls. The officer saluted the huge man in uniform sitting behind the desk and left me with him. After exchanging greetings, I handed this more senior figure the letter and explained the purpose of my visit again. ‚ÄúYou are a feminist,‚Äù he said simply when I‚Äôd finished. ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù I assured him. ‚ÄúWow. You are even proud of it,‚Äù he continued before launching into his own lecture. ‚ÄúYou see, this thing you are trying to do is commendable, but you are going about it the wrong way. You people want to do protest because men are beating women and raping them. But that‚Äôs not how to go about it. If someone is beating you, you don‚Äôt do protest. You beg them to stop. Me, I have never beat a woman before because what will I even beat in her body? Unless I want to kill her. So you people should adopt a milder approach. Be speaking with men and educating them instead. And you women too should be dressing decently‚Ä¶‚Äù I listened to him ramble on for about an hour in the hope it would end with him agreeing to our request, but instead he concluded: ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not going to grant you people permission or give you security.‚Äù I stared at him. ‚ÄúYou can go ahead and have the protest, but you won‚Äôt have security.‚Äù I stood up to leave. ‚ÄúSo can I take you out?‚Äù I was sure I had misheard him. ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù I asked. He said it again. ‚ÄúThere is a lodge near this place. We can do it there. I‚Äôll be there on Saturday. I‚Äôll give you my card. Just call me when you get to the gate.‚Äù It took a while for me to absorb that he was asking me to sleep with him. I politely took his card and left. This heart-breaking and defeating experience is representative of much of the mainstream attitude towards movements against sexual violence. In Nigeria as across the world, powerful abusers and their defenders resist any advances that would hold them accountable. They work to maintain a culture of impunity for gender-based crimes, using their authority where they can as community leaders, lecturers, preachers, politicians or the police. The police chief‚Äôs response to our protest therefore was perhaps not surprising. This was the same service whose officers in Abuja arrested women on the streets last year, accusing them of being sex workers before raping them in exchange for their freedom. Nor was the reaction of the state‚Äôs politicians. When the rally went ahead a few days later, the speaker of the State House of Assembly came out to let us down, saying: ‚ÄúWe have not domesticated the act because we don‚Äôt want to just import things from the [federal government], but we will look into it. We need to be sure that the act fits our society, but you people also need to take cognisance of the fact that women dress indecently‚Ä¶‚Äù Members of the public also enacted their resistance to the movement after the rally as people on social media circulated a picture of me from the protest holding a placard that said: ‚ÄúYour penis is not above the law‚Äù. On Facebook and Twitter, men described me as an apostate, no longer a Muslim, too vulgar, a prostitute, and more. One commenter thought I was shaming all of Arewa, citing himself as a better example of northern values even though he lives abroad. Others counselled parents on keeping their children safe, not from abusers and rapists and molesters but from activists like me. Sadly, the reaction also took on more extreme edges. Sadiya Taheer, who was heading the movement in Sokoto state, was beaten up by police. A fellow activist, Idris Abbas, who filmed the assault on his phone was arrested and only set free after he deleted the video. Prior to the rally, there had also been an attempt to undermine the protest by spreading the false claim that it was about promoting the LGBTQ community. There is nothing in the VAPP Act that relates to sexuality, but this was a well-calculated tactic aimed at tapping into widespread homophobia. This experience was a crash course in the ways the patriarchy acts to subvert change. But not all advocacy around sexual abuse is destined to fail. In Bauchi, the rally was more successful. In Borno, the movement recently received a copy of a proposed amended bill of the state penal code and was invited by state lawmakers to attend a public hearing to make contributions to the draft. Among other things, the proposed bill increases the punishment for rape to death by hanging, deems corroborative evidence immaterial to rape trials and provides for the punishment of sexual harassment in schools and workplaces. Meanwhile in Kano, where the protest was headed by Sani Muhammad, a passionate male ally of the movement, and involved religious and traditional leaders, meetings are now being had with members of the House to explore ways to accelerate the domestication of the VAPP Act. One lesson from this seems to be that for movements to be effective, they may need to find allies among people with different kinds of power such as male activists and traditional rulers. These friends are out there. During the attempts to divert attention from the rally to my placard, for instance, Sheikh Muhammad Nuru Khalid, an imam from Abuja, released a video arguing that there was nothing wrong with my message. He expressed surprise that the uproar was not directed at the growing cases of sexual violence, but at a placard seeking to address it. His intervention did not stem the abuse, but it provided a certain kind of legitimacy to the rally. Despite some setbacks, the movement against sexual violence in northern Nigeria is not giving up. Among other things, we‚Äôre now looking to partner with more allies like this and to hold meetings with state lawmakers. We know there will be plenty more resistance, but we will continue pushing for the domestication of the VAPP Act across northern Nigeria. Hauwa Shaffii Nuhu is a poet and essayist from Nigeria.

"129",2664,"https://everychildthrives.com/mexicans-of-african-descent-are-being-counted-in-historic-2020-census/","Mexicans of African descent are being counted in historic 2020 Census","This content is also available in: Espa√±ol (Spanish) Krey√≤l (Haitian Creole) To curb the spread of COVID-19, census workers in Mexico are taking certain safety measures, like standing a few extra feet from their interviewees. That‚Äôs not the only difference this year. For the first time in the nation‚Äôs history, Mexican census takers are asking residents if they identify as Afro-Mexican, Afro-descendant or Black. To understand the enormity of this development, it helps to know the background. As a Mexican who is interested in social justice and equality, I can tell you that conversations about racism and racial equity in Mexico are long overdue. In fact, the concept of racism was not a significant part of public discourse here until 1994 (173 years after independence from Spain), when the Zapatistas, militants for Indigenous rights, launched an armed insurgency. The Zapatista movement not only acknowledged racism as a concept; it exposed how all aspects of life for Indigenous people are affected by it in a country with a long history of discriminatory policies and practices targeting Indigenous people ‚Äì and Afro-Mexicans. Today, these conversations are just beginning to enter the mainstream, with Afro-Mexicans, Afro-descendants and members of the Black population leading the effort. Based on a 2015 public survey, it is estimated that 1.4 million people identify as Afro-Mexican. The presence of this population in what is now Mexico stretches back more than 500 years, starting with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. ""As a Mexican who is interested in social justice and equality, I can tell you that conversations about racism and racial equity in Mexico are long overdue."" In 2011, three Mexican women activists and academics founded El Colectivo para Eliminar el Racismo en M√©xico (COPERA) and soon set their eyes on the 2020 census. Because of their anti-racism work in Mexico, they understood the importance of this census as the first in the nation‚Äôs history to include a question about self-identification for Afro-Mexican, Afro-descendant and Black people. They believed that this question would reveal this population‚Äôs sociodemographic profile and spur a public conversation about racial equity and, in turn, potentially lead to the creation of public policies to address disadvantages. In 2017 and 2018, COPERA co-founder Dr. Emiko Saldivar, Dr. Erika Arenas at U.C. Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Dr. Patricio Sol√≠s at El Colegio de M√©xico (COLMEX) partnered to determine the most appropriate terminology to use in the census question, and how to capture not only the number of people of African descent, but the socio-economic situation associated with that population. They also looked for comparison at the question about Indigenous self-identification, which was first included in the census in 2000. Together these individuals and their organizations analyzed the data from past surveys to inform the wording of the census question. The analysis also informed the development of #AfroCensoMx, a communications campaign with two goals: to create awareness among the general population about the inclusion of Afro-Mexicans and Afro-descendants in the census, and to encourage people in the target population to self-identify and proudly name their heritage. This campaign brought together more than 30 entities, including some key grassroots organizations from the Afro-Mexican and Black movements in Mexico, Kellogg Foundation grantees COPERA, UCSB and COLMEX, and government institutions such as the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (CONAPRED) and the Senate. The campaign has, so far, generated more than 70 stories in various digital, television, radio and print outlets. The campaign is now in its most important phase ‚Äì the one aligned with the actual carrying out of the census, March 2-27. Monica Moreno Figueroa, one of COPERA‚Äôs co-founders, says the census initiative is part of an effort ‚Äúto make racism visible.‚Äù Today she teaches about race and racism at the University of Cambridge in England but frequently returns to Mexico for academic research and to work on the #AfroCensoMx campaign. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very interested in the life of racism, how racism works, how racism is felt and experienced by people,‚Äù Moreno Figueroa says, adding that pursuing this inquiry is ‚Äúvery hard in a country that has denied that racism exists.‚Äù But for Moreno Figueroa, who is Black-Mestiza and Mexican, this pursuit isn‚Äôt just intellectual. She says growing up in Mexico she experienced a ‚Äúpernicious‚Äù racism that included microaggressions and attacks to her sense of self. Yet she was part of a small minority ‚Äì a dark-skinned person in the middle class, and for those representing a more common alignment of race, class and economic standing, she says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs much worse, obviously. It‚Äôs structural.‚Äù While perhaps overdue, the timing of this census is significant. It comes on the heels of other advances in the inclusion of Blacks, Afro-Mexicans and Afro-descendants in Mexico. In 2019, Mexico‚Äôs government reformed the constitution to include a statement recognizing Afro-Mexican people as part of the multicultural nation, and it ratified both the Inter-American Convention against all Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance and the Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination, and Related Intolerance. Working with this coalition of intellectuals and grassroots activists has helped me see how far Mexico still has to go in addressing its history of racial discrimination, but has also given me hope that this combination of successes ‚Äì especially the new census question ‚Äì sets us on a path toward significant advances.

These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. Early this year, the short video app TikTok joined Nairobi Garage, a leading coworking space in Nairobi‚Äôs Kilimani district. The Chinese company behind the world‚Äôs fastest-growing social media app had already been holding ‚Äúcreator sessions‚Äù and meetups around the city in 2019, urging creative young Kenyans to learn about the benefits of joining the ‚Äúfun, cool short video platform‚Äù. Last October it partnered with Chinese phone maker Transsion‚Äôs Infinix brand in Kenya with a hashtag campaign called #WeAreHot to boost a new phone model but also raise awareness of the app. TikTok has been investing quietly, but significantly, to usher in a new age of influencers in Africa. It‚Äôs part of a concerted strategy for the youth-friendly app to get a major foothold in the world‚Äôs youngest continent and home to some of the leading global pop culture movers across music and film especially with the recent rise of Afrobeats and Nollywood. In Nigeria, TikTok has been signing up comedians, dancers and singers from Instagram and YouTube with promises of higher visibility and more followers. By October, the company owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, hired a local ‚Äútalent acquisition manager‚Äù tasked with ‚Äútalent management, co-branding campaigns, and creative hashtags,‚Äù according to a LinkedIn post. TikTok‚Äôs investment in local offices and hires has come with major gains. It is currently the third-ranked social media application among Nigerian users and the sixth-ranked social media app among Kenyans in the Google Play Store. For South Africa, TikTok has a dedicated account @tiktok.southafrica with much of the usual youthful fare of the latest dance steps and quirky clips. In January, in a sure sign of the growing importance of TikTok to driving usage, phone company MTN inked a deal to create customized MTN TikTok internet data bundles. It was a similar strategy that saw WhatsApp usage rocket in South Africa. When TikTok first looked at the African market in 2018, it had barely been searched by Africans on Google trends. Today, hits for TikTok top searches for terms like ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù in the apps three key markets: Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Facebook has worked tirelessly for the hearts and minds of African users going so far as to offer free data usage for its networks of apps in almost half of the countries in Africa. Over time WhatsApp has become the most popular platform across Africa. But TikTok is taking a different approach by focusing on understanding the African market and encouraging users to express themselves in the way that they know best. It has been hiring local staff and developing creators in its three key markets (Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa) since 2018, giving the app a competitive advantage in targeting popular creators and gaining a feel for the type of content its users like to see. ‚ÄúInstead of serving up videos from only the popular, big-name users on the platform, the individualized feed highlights video content based on the types of videos users like,‚Äù TikTok says in a statement to Quartz Africa. #Africancheck on TikTok has 3.8 million views. Using this hashtag with video footage, overlaid by ambient beats, young Africans create videos showing off exactly what they feel it means to be African.‚ÄúLots of spices‚Äô flash over TikTok Kenyan creator Polly Wachirah‚Äôs screen as she pans over her cupboard. ‚ÄúKitengi‚Äù Tanzanian and Ugandan user quinlytfah0 shows off the classic East African fabric. The same hashtag on Instagram, has fewer than 100 posts a number of which are reposts from the TikTok app. ‚ÄúIf you want to think of Africa from a community standpoint, it‚Äôs a very tight knit, very highly networked, therefore if people are able to see their friends, people they know, celebrities they know, [and] what they are doing, it becomes very powerful as a feature,‚Äù says Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi Technologies, an influencer marketing platform in Nairobi, localized content is an important feature for African users. TikTok‚Äôs ability to pull off hyper-localized hashtags that capture the spirit of African creators is largely due in part to the app‚Äôs powerful algorithm that utilizes location data and user tastes to recommend content under a tab aptly named ‚Äúfor you‚Äù. For example, when a TikTok user in Kenya logs into the app, they are fed an array of videos from a mix of Kenyan creators and popular TikTok creators from around the world. This enables up and coming creators on the continent increased visibility and more followers. Popular Nigerian TikTok creator @mcshemcomedian posted his first TikTok video in May 2019. He currently has 2.4 million followers on his TikTok account alone, more than his following on his Youtube and Instagram accounts combined. Creating a video on TikTok involves three key steps: making a video, adding creative filters and editing tools, and using the right hashtag. Users post variations of the same video under the same hashtag challenge and the results vary dramatically. Community support has been crucial to getting African creators to transfer their skills and expertise to the app. Though says it does not pay creators, it does provide creators with ‚Äúcommunity management teams‚Äù, ‚Äúoffline support‚Äù, ‚Äúcreative filters‚Äù and ‚Äúediting tools‚Äù. For many young Africans these resources have been a major draw. On Instagram and Facebook, creators can be limited in the content they produce without third party tools that take up storage space and data on cell phones. Though Africans are now using more smartphones because of affordable phone makers like Huawei and Tecno, video and photo quality still varies significantly from expensive premium phone brands. TikTok levels the playing field for all users regardless of the phone being used. As long as a TikTok creator has the app, they can use the full range of features offered, that are periodically updated without adding third party apps. TikTok‚Äôs most popular creators in the US have been able to parlay their following on the app to full fledged careers. TikTok‚Äôs most followed creator Lorengray has skyrocketed from TikTok star to actress and music artist. The potential for African users to do the same on the platform is not quite there yet, but there‚Äôs plenty of promise as there are fewer legacy barriers unlike Hollywood. The app has become a major platform for brands looking to monetize user attention, especially that of Gen Z audiences. Big brands like the NBA, Chipotle and the Washington post have taken to TikTok with creative ideas for brand exposure. TikTok‚Äôs largest user base in Africa is Gen Z and millennials, according to TikTok representatives. With a youth population that is expected to double by 2055 TikTok may become the core marketing tool for brands in Africa as it has in China and the United States.

"131",2691,"https://theconversation.com/massive-african-infrastructure-projects-often-hurt-rather-than-help-local-people-132699","Massive African infrastructure projects often hurt, rather than help, local people","Lecturer in Urban Studies and Planning, University of Sheffield Tom Goodfellow received funding for this research from the Economic and Social Research Council (grant no. ES/N018095/1).  University of Sheffield provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Big infrastructure projects are always controversial. Yet in parts of the world associated with severely deficient infrastructure, the positive value of major infrastructure investments is often taken as a given. This assumption needs to be subjected to much greater scrutiny, as I argue in new research that explores the narrative of Africa‚Äôs ‚Äúinfrastructure gap‚Äù and why different bodies are rushing to ‚Äúplug‚Äù it. The nature of the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth is already contested. Despite their tendency to produce a short term boom, there is evidence that big infrastructure investments can exacerbate economic fragility. But such negative impacts are more than economic. While some internationally financed transport projects are very popular with many city-dwellers ‚Äì such as the light rail in Addis Ababa, regardless of its other failings ‚Äì others can generate widespread anger and various perverse local impacts. The reality is that the kinds of projects attracting big finance are rarely structured to benefit those who most urgently require infrastructure access. In Nalumunye, a suburb of the Ugandan capital Kampala, some people are so angry about the newly opened expressway carving an impassable barrier through their lives that they refused to take part in my team‚Äôs research about it. This is more than mere nimbyism. Those living near the road are furious on the grounds that it is useless to them, has inflated land values for some other people while cutting off their land and swamping it in dust, and offers no easily accessible entry points. On one side of the road, commutes into the city have hugely increased in length as many people have to travel miles in the wrong direction before reaching a crossing point. On the other, people are cut off from land and families on which their livelihoods depend. Meanwhile, the social character of the area has changed dramatically as speculators swarm in to build luxurious villas. Many of these remain empty as the promised local benefits of the road fail to materialise. Even if they can access the road, ordinary people fear that the toll payments, when introduced, won‚Äôt be affordable. Of course, the expressway has its benefits for regular travellers between the capital and Entebbe airport ‚Äì though there are growing concerns about continuing low usage a year and a half after its opening. Dubbed the world‚Äôs most expensive road, it provides just one among many examples of large, expensive infrastructure projects for which the benefits are increasingly being questioned within Africa. Africa is often presented in international media and policy as being held back by absences that need filling. But rarely is much attention paid to different experiences of this ‚Äúneed‚Äù or who benefits from filling such gaps. The idea of a yawning African ‚Äúinfrastructure gap‚Äù is the ultimate example of this, with the shortfall in infrastructure often estimated in hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. It is true that there are major infrastructure challenges in many parts of Africa. But a careful look at the motivations behind the increased emphasis on this ‚Äúgap‚Äù by a range of financial bodies such as pension funds, insurance companies and other major global investors is needed. Since the financial crisis of 2007-09, such bodies have been looking for new kinds of asset to invest in. This has led to Africa‚Äôs infrastructure gap being increasingly framed as an investment opportunity. While it is often Chinese-financed infrastructure like the road described above that is currently most visible, a further wave of infrastructure financed by private international capital from the West is on the horizon. From South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, infrastructure financed through public-private-partnerhips and other forms of ‚Äúblended finance‚Äù are being touted as the answer to Africa‚Äôs challenges. In the words of the South African government, such projects ‚Äúmust be large‚Äù and must provide a ‚Äúsufficiently attractive risk profile‚Äù for investors. Yet the popular idea that boosting the global financing of African infrastructure represents a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù for investors and African populations is problematic. There is evidence that the infrastructure that global financiers want to fund, such as toll roads, is not the kind that is most desperately needed by the majority of the population. Much more important are the relatively unglamourous critical infrastructures required to provide safe water, sanitation, drainage and transport accessible to all. Meanwhile, as the Kampala case shows, big infrastructure investments often push up the value of land as speculators and high-end developers come in. This frequently displaces pre-existing populations. The rising cost of land and property in urban Africa, especially in rapidly transforming areas on the peripheries of large cities, is also associated with increased land conflicts. In west Africa particularly, it is common for groups of men ‚Äì known as ‚Äúlandguards‚Äù in Ghana or ‚ÄúOmo-Onile‚Äù (children of the soil) in Lagos ‚Äì to base their livelihoods around violently extorting resources from ordinary people attempting to build on urban land, citing ancestral claims to the land as justification. The boost to land prices provided by infrastructure investments is likely to exacerbate these practices, if not carefully managed. As one Nigerian landowner once noted to myself and a colleague: ‚ÄúLand is the crude oil of Lagos.‚Äù Valuable land echoes the idea of a ‚Äúresource curse‚Äù through which abundance in a resource, such as oil, can generate violent conflict. And as wealthy urban property-owners cash in on increased land values, they also form an important political lobby that can block progressive reforms such as increased property taxation. Ironically, this starves city governments of the resources to provide the infrastructures that really matter for the poor. Instead of presenting African cities as places characterised by absences, it is crucial to understand the interests and everyday practices that exist in these supposed ‚Äúgaps‚Äù. This is not only about considering who will be displaced by mega-infrastructures: it means paying attention to whether they might generate new opportunities for some by preying on or excluding others. Current ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù financed by international investors seeking high rates of return are not only offering limited prospects for the poor. They could even generate new forms of political instability by amplifying inequality and displacement, and fomenting land-based grievances.

"132",2701,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-52314282","Coronavirus: Lions nap on road during South African lockdown","Sooner or later animals were going to notice that the humans had disappeared and in South Africa's Kruger National Park lions have been taking advantage. Park ranger Richard Sowry was out on patrol on Wednesday when he snapped a pride sleeping on a road which would normally be busy with tourists. But Kruger, like other wildlife parks, has been shut since 25 March as part of the coronavirus lockdown. Big cats would usually only be seen by rangers on the roads by night. As a ranger in one of Africa's largest game reserves, Mr Sowry performs an essential service and continues to work during the lockdown, checking on the wildlife and guarding against poachers. While driving near Orpen Rest Camp on Wednesday afternoon, he spotted the lions on the road ahead and pulled up just five metres (5.5 yards) away to look at the unusual phenomenon. As he took photos with his mobile phone, the lions did not seem bothered, most of them apparently fast asleep. ""Lions are used to people in vehicles,"" he explained. ""All animals have much more of an instinctive fear of people on foot, so if I had walked up they would never have allowed me to get so close."" The oldest lioness in the pride is about 14, ""which is very old for a lioness"", so they are used to seeing vehicles. Normally Mr Sowry would only see lions sleeping on the park's roads on colder nights in the winter, when the tar retains quite a lot of heat. What rangers do not want, however, is for lions to start thinking that roads are a safe place just because they are now so still. These quiet times have also seen lions as well as wild dogs venturing on to a golf course in the park but otherwise Mr Sowry does not think that the lockdown has had any major effect on the animals' behaviour yet. pic.twitter.com/50DtDGmHEm ""Kruger is a very wild place,"" he says. ""It has been wild and it is still wild."" He is just happy to share his photos with people who cannot visit the park right now because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""These are difficult times for everyone and the intention was to bring people joy,"" he says. To date, South Africa has recorded 34 deaths of people with Covid-19 and registered 2,506 cases of infection, making it the most affected country in Africa. Its lockdown was extended on Wednesday by two weeks. ""Everybody realises the importance of the lockdown and the rangers are there to do their normal duties,"" says media officer Isaac Phaala. ""To maintain the infrastructure takes quite a bit of work so that when the park opens, you don't start from scratch."" As for the lions, he adds, ""normally they would be in the bushes because of the traffic but they are very smart and now they are enjoying the freedom of the park without us"". But why anyway, you might ask, would lions prefer tarmac to the softness of grass? Probably for the simple reason that it had been raining on Tuesday night and, as Mr Phaala explained, ""The tar was drier than the grass at the time - big cats and water don't mix.""

Mupenda   The Kenyan government has announced plans to evacuate its citizens who are stranded in China at their own travel costs. This decision comes after various reports accusing Beijing maltreatment to African people. There are various videos and pictures shared on twitter showing Africans including Kenyans and Nigerians sleeping on the street which prompted African community in diaspora and back home, call on government to rescue those stranded in commercial city of China. According to the notice issued by officials at Kenyan Embassy in Beijing, this Friday calls on Kenyans ready to buy a ticket out of China to send their information via online platform to be helped out of the country, via Guangzhou, the commercial city in the southern Guangdong province. But there are some conditions, the notice reads that only Kenyans will be evacuated as long as they can pay their own ticket adding that those Kenyans will have to prove they are free of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), this means they will have to be certified by Chinese medical authorities. Once they arrive in a country, they will be forced into quarantine for 14 days upon landing in Nairobi. ‚ÄúIf you are ready to travel under these conditions, fill the above QR code so that the bio-data reaches the Kenyan Embassy immediately, ‚Äúsaid the notice. Please be informed that the departure will be from Guangzhou on a date to be determined immediately, the above information is availed. It also provided the number of Mr. Kimoni Waweru, the deputy of head mission in Beijing to inquire from: +86600690463. However, Kenyans views on twitter suggest that the government should use the funds meant for the pandemic relief to have Kenyans flown back home. ‚ÄúOur Embassy in China is a big let down. You can‚Äôt offer distressed Kenyans an evacuation at their cost! Arrange Qq planes to lift our people. Pay from the Covid-19 fund. Pr Kibaki ordered us to evacuate Kenyans from SA when they faced xenophobic attacks and we did‚Äù, Sen. Moses Wetangu‚Äôla tweeted Africans have been mistreated by Chinese authorities imposing tight lockdown measures to prevent the virus from the country that is seen to be recovering from the deadly pandemic. The Kenyan ministry of Foreign affairs admitted its nationals were victims of the controversial policy, now considered as racist. ‚ÄúThis situation has been extremely worrisome to all of us. The reality is that this has been a very unfortunate outcome. ‚ÄúAfricans, Kenyans included, have been discriminated against in the process of [Guangdong provincial] government‚Äôs response to mop up the situation that they are facing there, post-crisis,‚Äù Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Macharia Kamau told a media briefing on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Kenyan Embassies across the world have been asked to update their records of Kenyans living in their areas of jurisdiction. A directive sent out from Nairobi this week says envoys must provide update data on those Kenyans in case evacuation is needed. *Mohammed M.

"134",2717,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52194018","Coronavirus wreaks havoc in African American neighbourhoods","Stark statistics from Chicago health officials have underscored the heavy toll of coronavirus on black Americans. Black Chicagoans account for half of all coronavirus cases in the city and more than 70% of deaths, despite making up 30% of the population. Other cities with large black populations, including Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans and New York, have become coronavirus hotspots. The US has recorded nearly 370,000 virus cases and almost 11,000 deaths. Globally there have been nearly 75,000 deaths and more than 1.3m cases total. As of 5 April, 1,824 out of Chicago's 4,680 confirmed Covid-19 cases were black residents, said city officials on Monday. That compared with 847 white, 478 Hispanic and 126 Asian Chicagoans. Chicago has seen a total of 98 deaths as of Sunday, with 72% of them black residents. The disparity is reflected across the state, where black people account for 41% of Covid-19 deaths, despite making up 14% of the population of Illinois. Chicago public health commissioner Dr Allison Arwady told reporters that black city residents already lived on average about 8.8 years less than their white counterparts. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the coronavirus was ""devastating black Chicago"". She said city inspectors would be sent into shops to ensure everyone was adhering to social distancing guidelines. Mayor Lightfoot also raised the possibility of curfews in areas where people gathered outside liquor stores, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. Though the coronavirus has been called the ""great equalizer"", data suggests that vulnerability to the infection may vary by neighbourhood. In Michigan, African Americans make up 14% of the population, but they account for 33% of the coronavirus cases and 41% of deaths, figures from the state health department showed on Monday. White residents account for about 23% of recorded cases in Michigan and 28% of deaths, according to the data. This video can not be played Detroit, Michigan, is about 80% black, and the city together with its surrounding suburbs accounts for around 80% of confirmed coronavirus cases. A similar disparity has emerged in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, one of the most segregated cities in the US. African Americans made up almost half of Milwaukee County's nearly 1,000 cases as of last Friday and 81% of its 27 deaths, despite black people accounting for 26% of the population there, according to a study by ProPublica. In hard-hit Louisiana, more than 70% of the people who have died of Covid-19 are black, despite African Americans making up 32% of the Gulf state's population. Some 40% of Louisiana's coronavirus deaths have occurred in the New Orleans area, where the majority of residents are black. Health officials have previously said the Big Easy's residents suffer from rates of obesity, diabetes and hypertension that are higher than the national average, making them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Mayor Lightfoot said diabetes, heart disease and respiratory illness were ""really prevalent"" in black communities. Dr Arwady told reporters that even if everyone in the city did have access to a doctor, ""we would still see significant health disparities because of food deserts and lack of walkable streets"". This video can not be played Dr Cameron Webb, an African-American physician who is running for Congress in the US state of Virginia, told BBC News that US racial and economic disparities were being amplified by the pandemic. ""It really exposes our society's fault lines,"" he said. Alderman Jason Ervin, who chairs Chicago council's black caucus, told the Chicago Tribune that ""rates of non-compliance in some parts of the city with the stay-at-home orders"" might also be contributing to the statistics.

In a unanimous vote via teleconference, the board approved the course standards on Friday, making it Texas‚Äô second statewide ethnic studies course. The first, focusing on Mexican American studies, gained statewide approval in 2018 after four years of controversy over its creation, textbook material and naming. But the African American studies course has garnered widespread support from the board and the public since it was proposed last fall. ‚ÄúApril 17th is going to be a historic day,‚Äù board member Ruben Cortez of Brownsville said before the final vote. ‚ÄúWe as a board have come a long way.‚Äù The course is modeled after a course taught in Dallas ISD for the first time this academic year. Aicha Davis, a freshman board member representing Dallas, asked the board to make the course a statewide option last September. ‚ÄúThis has just been an amazing journey,‚Äù Davis said Friday, tearing up. ‚ÄúThis course exceeded anything I ever thought it would. It‚Äôs something I wish I could have taken when I was young.‚Äù For Jamila Thomas, who worked with Davis on developing the course as the former director of Dallas ISD‚Äôs Racial Equity Office, the Friday vote was ‚Äúa dream come true.‚Äù She remembers writing a speech on how she would impact black history as a senior at Dallas‚Äô Lincoln Magnet High School in 1997. ‚ÄúSurprisingly, despite the major accomplishments, you rarely hear about the small achievements,‚Äù Thomas wrote in the speech. ‚ÄúWe know of Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey, but when do we stop and listen to what our ancestors are telling us.‚Äù The course accomplishes Thomas‚Äô goal of broadening black history by requiring students to learn about the contributions of African civilizations and African Americans throughout history to varied fields such as math, science, politics and the arts. ‚ÄúTo look back on that, and see how I‚Äôve been instrumental, along with some of our other peers, to make this happen, it's just, it's really unbelievable,‚Äù she said. The course also digs deeper into national policies. For example, on Thursday, Davis brought forward an amendment to have students discuss education beyond the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs decision Brown vs. Board of Education, which determined school segregation was unconstitutional. ‚ÄúSo now students get to learn the United States was the only country in the world that specifically made laws that banned teaching slaves,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúBut enslaved people found systems to be able to learn how to read, and so right from there, they founded colleges for black students.‚Äù Thomas said this in-depth look at African American studies will help students of all races think critically and better understand issues in our society today, including why the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a disproportionate number of deaths among black Americans. ‚ÄúThese things can be traced far back to help you get an understanding of why COVID-19 has really exposed, if you will, the inequity that exists in so many different communities,‚Äù she said. Davis said she hopes Texas‚Äô standards will help other states adopt similar courses, and she is already working with Grand Prairie ISD to develop a Native American studies course that could eventually be offered across the state. ‚ÄúI think the possibilities are limitless because of the success of the process and the rich curriculum that was created,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very optimistic about what this can do to help our students.‚Äù Mar√≠a M√©ndez, Politics Reporting Fellow.

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, announced on Monday that more than 70 percent of the deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were African Americans in his state. He said that this was ""obviously"" a ""big disparity."" ""Disturbingly, this information is going to show you that slightly more than 70 percent of the deaths in Louisiana are of African Americans,"" Edwards said during a press briefing. ""So that deserves more attention and we're going to have to dig into that and see what we can do to slow that trend down,"" he added. African Americans are estimated to make up just about 33 percent of the state's population, according to the most recent census data. The state's former governor, Mitch Landrieu, who is also a Democrat, raised concerns about the statistic in a Monday tweet. ""Wake up! Covid-19 doesn't discriminate in who it infects, but >70% of deaths in LA are African-American. Data point after data point showing communities of color seeing disproportionate health & economic impacts. Solutions must address underlying inequities in our society,"" he wrote. Edwards also shared some more optimistic news on Monday, noting that state officials no longer were concerned that their health care system would be overwhelmed by the novel virus. However, he urged residents to continue to follow stringent social distancing measures to maintain the progress. ""We are hopeful we're starting to see the beginning of flattening the curve,"" the governor said. ""We've bought ourselves more time that allows us to continue to surge our medical capacity and continue to flatten the curve,"" he added. ""And all of this stuff works in concert. So we've got to keep doing everything that we've been doing to have the best possible outcome."" As of Tuesday morning, Louisiana had more than 14,800 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to a tracker updated by Johns Hopkins University. Of those, 512 had died. Louisiana is not the only place in the country to see minority communities disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. The Wall Street Journal analyzed data from New York City, reporting that neighborhoods in the Queens borough with the largest immigrant populations were the hardest hit by the coronavirus. The Charlotte Observer also reported that in Charlotte, North Carolina‚Äìwhich is just one-third black‚Äìabout 44 percent of the confirmed coronavirus cases were African Americans. Reporting by ProPublica showed that 80 percent of coronavirus deaths in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were African American, while the city is just 26 percent black.

The group will in future focus on other townships where they have had success, one member said. Hundreds of people queuing for the parcels did not follow social distancing guidelines and chaos quickly broke out as they stormed the vehicles and started stealing the food parcels. Many vehicles were unable to escape as residents crowded the narrow streets. One blockaded vehicle was rocked back and forth, as desperate community members attempted to topple it and loot its contents. Tshwane Metro Police and private security intervened as the operation was abandoned and vehicles retreated to safety. A spokesperson for the joint scheme said the pilot operation was an attempt to establish whether the handing out of food parcels could be responsibly achieved in the township ‚Äì in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing this as a long-term thing; the economic situation is only going to get worse but we won‚Äôt be coming back here again‚Äù, he said. He added that the scheme‚Äôs efforts would be focused elsewhere, as they had already established successful systems in other communities, shelters and orphanages. An escorting police officer said she was saddened by the events, adding that now only a few would benefit. (Please note that the original version of the story said that 5,000 parcels had been stolen.

Family said Reggie Relf was the life of the party. The engineer had been looking after his elderly mother when in late March, he started feeling ill. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòAmi I got this cold I can‚Äôt beat‚Äô, said sister Ami Relf. ‚ÄúHe thought it was a cold and he had been coughing.‚Äù His sister eventually got him to go to an immediate care clinic in the western suburbs on March 29.

Relf continued to isolate himself in his mother‚Äôs basement and would communicate by texting. ‚ÄúHe had stopped texting,‚Äù Ami Relf said. ‚ÄúMy brother had brought him some food and left it at the step, and he did get that, but on April 6, my other brother Randy went into the basement and found him dead.‚Äù Paramedics believe he died two days earlier. The family later got confirmation from the medical examiner that Relf died of COVID-19. ‚ÄúThey sent him home to die,‚Äù Relf said. Relf said she is speaking out because she wants to highlight the health disparities within the African American community. ‚ÄúWith him having diabetes, that immediate care should have sent him to the emergency room, checked him in, something should have happened, he had all the symptoms,‚Äù Relf said. Health care disparities in the African American community have been a decades-long issue that‚Äôs once again taking center stage because of the virus. ‚ÄúGenerations of systemic disadvantages in healthcare delivery and in healthcare access in communities of color and black communities in particular are now amplified in this crisis,‚Äù Gov. Pritzker said Saturday. State officials said mortality rates in African Americans are five times higher than whites.

On Tuesday afternoon, 7 April 2020, the Minister of Transport gazetted new Directions under the lockdown Regulations to expressly permit the export of wines and other fresh produce products. The regulations stipulate that wines are permitted to be exported and agricultural cargo to be moved to sea ports and international airports for export. The Minister of Transport has permitted the following expressly:‚ÄúDuring the lockdown period, the transportation of the wines and any other fresh produce products at the sea ports and international Airports Designated as Port of Entry for export is allowed‚Äù The notice also stated the following:‚ÄúAgricultural Cargo is allowed to be transported to sea ports and International Airports Designated as Ports of Entry and exported to the relevant destination‚Äù Download the latest Government Gazette:Disaster Management Act 57 of 2002 ‚Äì Sea ports 7 April 2020 The Exporters Task Team is still taking all aspects in the Gazette into consideration and will meet soon to discuss and communicate all relevant operational activities. The South African wine industry is truly grateful to Government and all the respective role-players for showing an understanding for the industry‚Äôs challenges through this concession, as nearly half of South Africa‚Äôs wine production is exported and a restriction on exports would have a severe effect on wine-related businesses, but most importantly the livelihood of close to 300 000 people employed by the wine industry value-chain. The latest decision by Government follows on an earlier concession for the wine industry to complete harvesting and processing activities to prevent wastage during the 21 day lockdown.

An enigmatic African hominid fossil known as the Broken Hill skull dates to around 300,000 years ago, about the time that Homo sapiens started evolving across that continent, researchers say. The Natural History Museum/Alamy Stock Photo By Bruce Bower April 1, 2020 at 11:00 am A mysterious but well-preserved hominid skull found nearly a century ago comes from a population that lived in Africa around 300,000 years ago, as the earliest Homo sapiens were evolving, a new study finds. This discovery indicates that a separate Homo population, perhaps a species some researchers call H. heidelbergensis (SN: 6/22/19), inhabited Africa at the same time as both H. sapiens and a recently discovered population dubbed H. naledi (SN: 6/10/17), say geochronologist Rainer Gr√ºn and his colleagues. African H. heidelbergensis could have been a recently reported ‚Äúghost population‚Äù (SN: 3/14/20) that interbred with ancient H. sapiens and passed a small amount of DNA to present-day West Africans, the researchers suggest April 1 in Nature. ‚ÄúWe can now identify at least three distinct and contemporary [Homo] lineages in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but we don‚Äôt yet know whether our ancestry was largely or entirely contained within the H. sapiens part of that variation,‚Äù says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. Researchers have puzzled over the age of the Broken Hill skull since its 1921 discovery in south-central Africa. Metal ore mining at what was then Northern Rhodesia‚Äôs Broken Hill mine revealed deposits bearing the skull and two associated leg fossils. The site, located in what‚Äôs now known as Zambia, has been named Kabwe. Previous age estimates for the fossils, based on clues such rodent fossils and stone tools found at the site, have ranged widely from around 500,000 to 125,000 years old. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up. Because quarrying destroyed the site, sediment that may have yielded fossils can‚Äôt be dated. Instead, Gr√ºn, of Griffith University in Nathan, Australia, and his team dated small samples of bone and teeth from the Broken Hill skull using measures of the radioactive decay of uranium and the accumulation of natural radioactivity from sediment and cosmic rays. Based on these techniques, the team estimates the skull‚Äôs age at between 324,000 and 276,000 years old. Double-edged stone implements typically found at ancient H. sapiens sites were also recovered near the Broken Hill skull, suggesting that H. heidelbergensis made the same type of tools, the scientists say. It‚Äôs unclear if H. heidelbergensis fashioned those artifacts, which also can‚Äôt be definitively linked to the Broken Hill skull, counters archaeologist Eleanor Scerri of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. But a ‚Äúseemingly reliable age of approximately 300,000 years‚Äù for H. heidelbergensis in Africa fits a scenario in which H. sapiens began evolving across Africa (SN: 12/21/19) around that time , Scerri says. In that scenario, mating occurred among dispersed human populations with various skeletal traits, as did occasional interbreeding with other Homo species. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if there was some gene flow between the lineage leading to us and H. heidelbergensis,‚Äù she says. African Homo fossils from around 300,000 years ago (SN: 7/8/17), including the Broken Hill skull, are either direct ancestors or close relatives of H. sapiens, says paleoanthropologist Mar√≠a Martin√≥n-Torres of the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain. But H. heidelbergensis has become a confusing species designation, comprising a diverse group of partial hominid fossils that can‚Äôt easily be compared to one another, she contends. Populations in many parts of Africa may have mixed and mingled to produce H. sapiens, ‚Äúbut at this point the picture is still blurred,‚Äù Martin√≥n-Torres says.

"152",2986,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-52126563","Inside the collapse of an African construction giant","By Joel Gunter & Charles YoungBBC Africa Eye Spencon was once one of the largest construction firms in East Africa. After years of financial trouble, two highly-paid British bosses were brought in to save it, but 18 months later the bosses had fled and hundreds of Africans had lost their jobs. An Africa Eye investigation reveals the inside story of how Spencon went bust. In July 2015, two British bosses looked out from their new Nairobi offices over an empty patch of land and decided to build a golf green. Andrew Ross and Steven Haswell hired a consultant from one of Kenya's leading golf clubs. Trees were ripped up and replaced by bunkers and the smooth playing green was laid and nourished by a sprinkler system. ""How cool is this?"" wrote Haswell in an email home. ""We'll have chipping area, putting green, bunker and driving net."" Ross and Haswell were in Nairobi on a rescue mission: to save the struggling Kenyan construction giant Spencon. They had been appointed as directors of the company by US investment firm Emerging Capital Partners (ECP), which had in 2006 and 2007 invested a total of $15m in Spencon - including $1.5m of British government aid money designed to boost the Kenyan economy and create jobs. But Ross and Haswell did not succeed in saving Spencon. According to thousands of leaked company emails, messages, and documents obtained by Africa Eye, the two British bosses appear to have engaged in a pattern of highly questionable business practices as they tried to turn the company around. They now stand accused of allegedly working with a convicted criminal to defraud banks of millions of dollars, of implicitly threatening to sell out business partners to notorious Kenyan gangsters, and of making potentially illegal cash payments. This is the story of the 18 months Ross and Haswell spent in charge of Spencon before the company went bust, leaving hundreds of Kenyans out of work, some already missing months of pay. Nancy Ntinu, Spencon's former head of HR, took Africa Eye on a tour of the now abandoned golf green built by Ross and Haswell. ""Having a golf course for a company that is insolvent, on the verge of financial distress, that just doesn't add up,"" she said as she walked on the overgrown putting area. ""It was a mockery for Kenyan employees to watch this lawn being watered on a daily basis because these two gentlemen wanted to play golf."" Spencon was once one of the largest construction firms in East Africa - a giant that employed more than 5,000 staff at its peak and boasted major infrastructure projects across seven countries. It was headquartered in a tall office complex in the Upper Hill neighbourhood of Nairobi with successful multi-nationals for neighbours. But behind the scenes, Spencon was saddled with debt. In early 2014, ECP, the US firm which had invested $15m, took control of the construction company from its founders. In November 2014, ECP hired Ross - an engineer and business director who would assume overall control of Spencon. In April 2015 he was joined by Haswell - an accountant with experience of restructuring African businesses, who would run the finances. Haswell was to be paid $25,000 a month, Ross $30,000. Their job was to turn around Spencon's fortunes so that ECP could sell it by the end of 2016. They had just 18 months. With the business already on the brink, it was never going to be easy, but the fate of hundreds of staff across East Africa lay in Ross and Haswell's hands. Wycliffe Ochieng, a 38-year-old, assistant mechanic, was one of those staff. Ochieng had found happiness in his work at the company. It had allowed him to rent a small home with his wife and young daughter in Nairobi, with running water and electricity, and he began to dream of a better life for his family. When Spencon finally went bust, in November 2016, Ochieng found himself without work and in crippling debt. He was owed months of pay and he owed months of rent. ""He used to buy us things, like shoes and clothes,"" recalled his wife, Lynet. ""Some of things he did for us when we lived in town are different compared to now."" Now the family lives in a small hut on Ochieng's parents' property, 230 miles (370km) from Nairobi. They have no electricity and no running water. Ochieng shares a bed with Lynet and their young daughter, and works the land to feed them as well as he can. Some days he barely eats at all. ""I used to take care of my family like a man should,"" he said, dejectedly, when Africa Eye visited him there last year. ""It has really brought down my self-esteem."" Back in July 2015, Ochieng was arriving at Spencon for his first day as an assistant mechanic, blissfully unaware that the firm was already in serious trouble. Shortly after Ochieng started, Andrew Ross promised the staff that no one was going to lose their jobs, he said. But an email sent in April by Steven Haswell shows he was already worried. ""I think we are going to lose this patient!"" he wrote. ""We have 4 months of cash left ‚Ä¶ It's not looking good."" The two bosses cut costs by July, making a round of redundancies and relocating Spencon from its upmarket Nairobi headquarters to a dusty out-of-town maintenance depot owned by the company, where simple pre-fab workshops were converted into offices. But they also started spending. A week after the move to the depot, Ross and Haswell paid $70,000 for their own company cars - a Range Rover and Volkswagen Touareg. Haswell told Africa Eye the cars projected an image of an organisation of substance rather than one close to insolvency. Ross said the vehicles were deemed appropriate by the board. But staff were not impressed. ""It was a lavish expenditure,"" said Spencon's equipment manager, Mike Hyland, who arranged the purchase. Dickens Omollo, the head of security at the depot, was taken aback by Ross's Range Rover. ""We wondered - this is a lot of money, and we don't have money, and he is saying he wants to bring this company up?"" Ross and Haswell also got to work on their golf green. The head groundsman they had hired from one of Kenya's leading golf clubs set about designing the plush practice area - complete with two bunkers containing 120 tons of sand. The two bosses told Africa Eye the golf course was built at negligible cost using Spencon staff and equipment, and projected a positive image of the company. Simeon Randinga, a janitor at the firm, felt the course was off limits to ordinary staff. ""The golf course was out of bounds for the rest of us,"" he said. ""It was theirs alone."" Ross and Haswell told Africa Eye the green was open for all the staff to use. Getting a job at Spencon had meant the world to Randinga. He was newly married, and had begun to fear his wife would leave him if he could not provide for her. The regular income from Spencon eased his fears, and after a few months of work his wife moved to Nairobi to join him, and they had a child. Then in mid 2015, Randinga noticed something that worried him, he said - the company appeared to be selling off perfectly good equipment alongside scrap and redundant machinery. ""When they were selling those things, I asked, 'These are very good things, why are you selling them? Are you sure we still have our jobs?'."" The man behind the sales was Tony Sanghani, a security consultant hired by Ross and Haswell. As well as security, the two bosses tasked him with a fire sale of Spencon equipment. They would later say they had no idea Sanghani was a convicted criminal. A simple Google search shows that he and his brother were sent to prison in 2002 for inciting their own company security guards to assault two men. Mike Hyland, the Spencon equipment manager, was convinced Ross and Haswell knew. ""I'm 100% certain they did,"" he said. ""I told Andrew Ross when I resigned, you know you were dealing with a criminal."" According to Hyland, Ross replied: ""We have to do what we have to do."" Ross denied knowing about Sanghani's record or replying in that fashion. Leaked emails show Sanghani had the two boss's full backing to sell assets. ""Please all help and support Tony convert the old equipment and spare parts into cash,"" wrote Haswell in an email to staff in October 2015. ""Please ensure Tony is given full support,"" wrote Ross in a separate email. As Randinga and other staff at Spencon grew concerned about their jobs, Sanghani was taking home a huge salary and living in a free serviced apartment with a car and driver, with the promise of cash bonuses on top of his pay for delivering on the equipment selloff. ""It seemed to be a clearance sale completely, assets sold at giveaway prices,"" said Kabiito Karamagi, a receiver appointed after Spencon went bust to look into sales made by Sanghani in Uganda. ""What we found was a gross under valuation."" The proceeds from those sales should have gone to paying off the firm's bank debts in Uganda, but the money was instead deposited into Sanghani's personal account. When a member of Spencon staff emailed Haswell querying the arrangement, and asking if it would present the company with legal issues, Haswell replied: ""It's ok‚Ä¶ we can pay to Tony's bank account."" Karamagi, the receiver, questioned how the money had been accounted for. ""It's certainly most unusual that these monies are not banked on the company account, but on an individual's account. It is most unusual,"" he said. ""It smacks of fraud."" After Spencon went bust, the administrators - international accounting firm PWC - discovered Sanghani had been paid $20,000 a month by Ross and Haswell, plus up to 25% commission. PWC called the amount ""outrageous"" in the context of Spencon's financial position. PWC also discovered a huge black hole in Spencon's books - at least $1.6 million had not been accounted for. According to Karamagi's calculations, the amount missing may be even higher. PWC did find some money had been paid to Spencon creditors, but none to the Ugandan banks, which had agreed to the asset sales in the expectation they would get the sale funds. Questions also remain around the sale of Spencon assets in Kenya, and PWC has handed over files to Kenyan police. ""There was an intention to defraud creditors, pure and simple,"" said Karamagi. ""What you have here is a situation of embezzlement, fraud."" Ugandan police told Africa Eye they were working with Interpol to question Ross and Haswell. Both men categorically denied any wrong-doing and said they were unaware of any criminal investigation or any claims bought in administration relating to the sales. Haswell said the equipment sale cash was deposited into Sanghani's account to protect it from creditors who had ""dubious"" court orders to seize it, and to allow Spencon to ""disburse the funds as it chose"", he said. Both men said all funds received from Mr Sanghani's sales were accounted for and that the value of the equipment was overstated and banks were kept informed at all times. ""The transactions were recorded in the company accounts and approved by the board,"" said Ross. ECP told us it had had ""no knowledge of these alleged actions by Mr Sanghani"" and ""no interest in having Spencon's money deposited in other people's accounts."" At the end of 2016, PWC pressed Tony Sanghani to hand over his accounts but he refused to co-operate. According to the administrators, the $1.6 million is still missing. Africa Eye contacted Tony Sanghani but he declined to respond. In December 2015, Ross and Haswell's hopes for saving Spencon were resting partly on a payout the firm was owed by the Kenyan government for work on a sewage treatment plant in Mombasa in 2000 - valued by Spencon at $16.5 million. And there was an added incentive in their contracts: if the payment was approved, Ross would be entitled to a bonus of up to $80,000 and Haswell up to $64,000. The two British bosses were about to enter one of the murkiest chapters in the Spencon saga. Before paying out, the Kenyan government demanded to see the original certificate to Spencon confirming completion of the works, but there was a problem: Spencon couldn't find it. They had just 10 days before they had to present the certificate in court. Spencon's lawyer Rose Osiemo rushed to Mombasa, where she obtained a letter from the County Secretary authorising a new certificate. But when she visited the Mombasa government department responsible for issuing it, there was a snag. WhatsApp messages sent six days later reveal the obstacle - someone was demanding an $80,000 cash payment. Haswell put Tony Sanghani on standby, and messaged Osiemo to let her know. ""I told him what is happening ‚Ä¶ He agreed you can ask him to squeeze them if u want???"" But Osiemo said her contact wanted to remain anonymous. ""Want it to remain between me and them lest they are exposed,"" she wrote back to Haswell. If the payment was above board, why was it being paid in cash, and why was Osiemo keeping her contact secret? Osiemo needed the money before an early-morning flight to Mombasa to meet her contact, setting off a frantic rush to get the cash. Haswell was in Tanzania. ""I'm now in bank getting $80k cash for you,"" he messaged Osiemo. He kept Ross in the loop: ""Trying to withdraw $80k cash from SCB Tanzania. I will fly back with it tonight."" Haswell flew back and handed two envelopes stuffed with cash to Osiemo, who made her early morning flight to Mombasa carrying the cash in her handbag, accompanied by Tony Sanghani. ""Remember 11 people minimum know that you are travelling with $80k,"" Haswell wrote to her. ""Stay alert and safe."" Osiemo paid the contact and obtained a letter confirming the work had been completed, as well as a file of background documentation. But the scheme failed - the money the government owed Spencon wasn't released. Africa Eye showed evidence of the $80,000 payment to Jeremy Carver, a lawyer who helped draft the UK's anti-bribery laws. ""The payment of $80,000 is pretty well documented in the papers that I have seen,"" Carver said. ""It looks like a bribe, it smells like a bribe and it's paid by people who work for a company who are plainly trying to keep it secret."" According to UK law, if a British citizen is involved in bribery, it doesn't matter where in the world that alleged bribe took place. ""For the British Directors, and indeed anybody involved in the payment, they on the face of it need to be investigated,"" said Carver. Osiemo denied paying any cash bribes to anyone to settle the Mombasa claim. She said the money was a fee paid to an unnamed consultant contracted by Spencon, who hired four independent engineers to inspect the site and write a report confirming the works were complete. It was one of those engineers, she said, who gave her documentation. A document emailed to Haswell the next day lists the $80,000 payment under expenses, with no contractors named. Ross declined to comment on the expense claim, while Haswell said he had no first-hand knowledge of why the transaction was recorded in this way. They declined to say who received the $80,000 or why the payment had to be made in cash, saying the money went to debt collection agents. And they strongly denied bribing Government officials, and said the WhatsApp messages and emails had been taken out of context. Ross said he and Haswell informed the ECP board of the progress of the expenses claim and the parties it dealt with. ECP said it had no knowledge of how any replacement certificate was obtained. As they attempted to turn Spencon around for sale, Ross and Haswell needed to make a clean break from the company's past. But they were hampered by a lawsuit filed against Spencon by the firm's founding family, the Patels, over the ECP takeover back in 2014. Pragnesh Patel, whose father founded Spencon in 1979, told Africa Eye that Ross and Haswell called him to a meeting at the Kempinski Hotel in Nairobi in December 2015 and offered to give up Spencon's share in a piece of valuable development land in return for dropping the suit. Patel said that when he asked what would happen if he refused, the two British bosses dropped a name of a potential purchaser for Spencon's share of the land-owning company - the Akasha family. The Akashas are notorious Kenyan gangsters. In August 2019, Batktash Akasha was sentenced to 25 years in jail in the US for running a global drugs trafficking operation. In January, his brother Ibrahim got 23 years for the same offence. Tony Sanghani was one of those who knew the Akashas well. According to evidence given during their court case, the Akashas beat him so badly during a gangland drugs turf war in 2014 that Sanghani ended up in a coma. Pragnesh Patel was afraid, he said. He left the meeting and went to consider his options, he said, then he asked Ross for a second meeting, at a Nairobi coffee house, and this time he secretly recorded on his phone. On the recording, Patel can be heard asking Ross if the connection to the Akashas is genuine. ""It's genuine Pragnesh,"" Ross replies. ""It's not us playing games, it's genuine."" ""This is very serious,"" said Patel. ""You know, the Akasha family are the equivalent of Al Capone. Even if they know that I'm trying to block a sale, they can actually send a hitman and things like that."" It was one of several times Patel voiced his fears about the company potentially being sold to the Akashas. Not once, in the entire recording, can Ross be heard contradicting those fears. Ross told us it was absurd and untrue he threatened Patel with the Akasha family. When Africa Eye sent him a transcript of the recording, he said at no point did he mention the Akashas. Haswell said at no time did Spencon consider entering any transaction with the Akashas, and suggested Patel was trying to lead or entrap Ross. He said he had no knowledge of the Akashas until Patel mentioned them. By the middle of 2016, Spencon was on its knees. The final days of the company were about to play out at the maintenance depot outside Nairobi that had become its home. Nancy Ntinu, the head of HR, was working closely with Ross and Haswell, she said, in basic offices in wooden buildings on the depot grounds. Staff salaries were drying up and workers were getting more and more angry. Many, including Ntinu, had not been paid properly in months. ""I was literally crying every day because I couldn't believe the kind of situation I'd got myself into,"" she said. Ntinu told Africa Eye that Ross ran through a list of staff, instructing her who to pay and who not to pay. ""There was one female colleague who was on maternity leave and he took off her name. I asked why, and he said, 'Well you snooze you lose'."" One person always got paid, Ntinu claimed - Ross. ""He will always pay himself,"" she said. Ross told Africa Eye that the lowest paid staff were always paid first and that his own pay was delayed on several occasions. He denied using the phrase, 'You snooze you lose'. At the depot, Spencon staff were working on without pay in the hope the company would be saved. Wycliffe Ochieng, the assistant mechanic, said the missing pay was affecting his marriage. Ochieng's wife began to suspect he was spending his salary on another woman. Eventually she left, forcing him to send his daughter hundreds of miles away to his parents' home so he could continue to go to work. Simeon Randinga, the janitor, began hiding from his landlord because he had no money to pay his rent. ""We found ourselves going home empty handed at the end of the month,"" he said. ""The landlord is there waiting for you and you also need food, yet you have nothing."" But never contemplated complaining to Andrew Ross. ""To reach him was like going to heaven,"" he said. Ross was on a golfing holiday in Turkey when he finally signed insolvency papers for Spencon. Back at the Nairobi depot, bailiffs had begun to seize company property and staff were in revolt. When Ross returned, he called a meeting in the canteen, a dimly-lit prefab structure set slightly apart from the other buildings on the compound, to give staff the news. They were furious, and a group of about 15 came to Ntinu to demand answers. ""You are talking about very angry people, who are hungry, who don't have anything to feed their families,"" she said. Ntinu knew then that it was all over. She told Africa Eye she lost seven months of pay - about ¬£39,000. After almost four decades in business, Spencon was gone. Not far behind were Ross and Haswell. ""We heard one morning that they had boarded an aircraft and gone back to the UK,"" said Ntinu. ""And that was it."" Ross and Haswell told Africa Eye they were proud of their time at Spencon, saying it was managed in a challenging business environment against a backdrop of inherited debt, within the law and always with legal advice. They said they sympathised with the disappointment and anger of workers, and rejected any allegations of wrongdoing. They said they had to flee Kenya because they were facing threats, and that they continued to work on Spencon business unpaid for another four months. Three and a half years on, both men are now employed in senior positions in UK firms. Many Spencon staff were not so lucky. None of the workers received their missing pay. Simeon Randinga, the janitor, now sells charcoal in an effort to support his family. He struggled against the urge to take his own life, he said. ""When you are not working, you are just a useless man, you cannot help anyone. You cannot feed your family, you cannot pay house rent. Even bathing is not possible because you cannot buy soap."" Wycliffe Ochieng, the mechanic, never returned to the Nairobi home that had allowed him to dream - the landlord locked him out and locked all of his belongings inside. All he has left now is his Spencon safety helmet and overalls. He was once proud to wear them, he said, they had made him feel like a success. His daughter sometimes asks him to put them on again, to play, but he has lost weight since his Spencon days, and the overalls hang loosely from his thinner frame. Ochieng occasionally speaks to some of his old Spencon colleagues, from a payphone nearby. ""Sometimes I get a call - Hey, my friend, can you loan me 100 shillings?"" It's 80p, $1.

"158",3065,"https://news.yahoo.com/african-community-targeted-china-virus-crackdown-053136117.html","African community targeted in China virus crackdown","Beijing (AFP) - Africans in southern China's largest city say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing as the country steps up its fight against imported infections. China says it has largely curbed its COVID-19 outbreak but a recent cluster of cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus prevention officials. Local authorities in the industrial centre of 15 million said at least eight people diagnosed with the illness had spent time in the city's Yuexiu district, known as ""Little Africa"". Five were Nigerian nationals who faced widespread anger after reports surfaced that they had broken a mandatory quarantine and been to eight restaurants and other public places instead of staying home. As a result, nearly 2,000 people they came into contact with had to be tested for COVID-19 or undergo quarantine, state media said. Guangzhou had confirmed 114 imported coronavirus cases as of Thursday -- 16 of which were Africans. The rest were returning Chinese nationals. It has led to Africans becoming targets of suspicion, distrust and racism in China. Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. ""I've been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat... I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,"" said Tony Mathias, an exchange student from Uganda who was forced from his apartment on Monday. ""We're like beggars on the street,"" the 24-year-old said. Mathias added that police had given him no information about testing or quarantine but instead told him ""to go to another city"". Police in Guangzhou declined to comment when contacted by AFP. A Nigerian businessman said he was evicted from his apartment earlier this week. ""Everywhere the police see us, they will come and pursue us and tell us to go home. But where can we go?"" he said. - Growing tensions - Other Africans said the community had been subject to mass COVID-19 testing even though many had not left China recently, and placed under arbitrary quarantine at home or in hotels. China has banned foreign nationals from entering the country and many travellers are being sent into 14-day quarantines either in their own accommodation or at centralised facilities. Thiam, an exchange student from Guinea, said police ordered him to stay home on Tuesday even after he tested negative for COVID-19 and told officers he had not left China in almost four years. He believes the measures are specifically and unfairly targeting Africans. ""All the people I've seen tested are Africans. Chinese are walking around freely but if you're black you can't go out,"" he said. Denny, a Nigerian trader evicted from his flat on Tuesday, said police moved him to a hotel for quarantine after he spent several days sleeping on the streets. ""Even if we have a negative test result, police don't let us stay (in our accommodation) and they don't give a reason why,"" he said. - 'Crazy fear' - The infections in Guangzhou have sparked a torrent of abuse online, with many Chinese internet users posting racist comments and calling for all Africans to be deported. Last week a controversial cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media. ""There's just this crazy fear that anybody who's African might have been in contact with somebody who was sick,"" said David, a Canadian living in Guangzhou who did not want to give his full name. China's foreign ministry acknowledged this week that there had been some ""misunderstandings"" with the African community. ""I want to emphasise that the Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally,"" said spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday, urging local officials to ""improve their working mechanisms"". The complaints in Guangzhou contrast with a welcome reception to Chinese efforts in battling the coronavirus across the African continent, where Beijing this week donated medical supplies to 18 countries. ""When China engages Africa it's the central government that does that, but when it comes to immigration enforcement that happens at the local level,"" said Eric Olander, managing editor of the China Africa Project. ""That explains why there's an inconsistency in the more upbeat messaging we hear about Chinese diplomacy on the continent and the increasingly difficult realities that African traders, students and other expatriates face in their day-to-day lives in China.""

"159",3088,"https://www.good.is/Health/coronavirus-spread-african-americans-data","Early data shows African Americans have contracted and died of Coronavirus at an alarming rate","ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published. The coronavirus entered Milwaukee from a white, affluent suburb. Then it took root in the city's black community and erupted. As public health officials watched cases rise in March, too many in the community shrugged off warnings. Rumors and conspiracy theories proliferated on social media, pushing the bogus idea that black people are somehow immune to the disease. And much of the initial focus was on international travel, so those who knew no one returning from Asia or Europe were quick to dismiss the risk. Then, when the shelter-in-place order came, there was a natural pushback among those who recalled other painful government restrictions ‚Äî including segregation and mass incarceration ‚Äî on where black people could walk and gather. ""We're like, 'We have to wake people up,'"" said Milwaukee Health Commissioner Jeanette Kowalik. As the disease spread at a higher rate in the black community, it made an even deeper cut. Environmental, economic and political factors have compounded for generations, putting black people at higher risk of chronic conditions that leave lungs weak and immune systems vulnerable: asthma, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. In Milwaukee, simply being black means your life expectancy is 14 years shorter, on average, than someone white. As of Friday morning, African Americans made up almost half of Milwaukee County's 945 cases and 81% of its 27 deaths in a county whose population is 26% black. Milwaukee is one of the few places in the United States that is tracking the racial breakdown of people who have been infected by the novel coronavirus, offering a glimpse at the disproportionate destruction it is inflicting on black communities nationwide. In Michigan, where the state's population is 14% black, African Americans made up 35% of cases and 40% of deaths as of Friday morning. Detroit, where a majority of residents are black, has emerged as a hot spot with a high death toll. As has New Orleans. Louisiana has not published case breakdowns by race, but 40% of the state's deaths have happened in Orleans Parish, where the majority of residents are black. Illinois and North Carolina are two of the few areas publishing statistics on COVID-19 cases by race, and their data shows a disproportionate number of African Americans were infected. ""It will be unimaginable pretty soon,"" said Dr. Celia J. Maxwell, an infectious disease physician and associate dean at Howard University College of Medicine, a school and hospital in Washington dedicated to the education and care of the black community. ""And anything that comes around is going to be worse in our patients. Period. Many of our patients have so many problems, but this is kind of like the nail in the coffin."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks virulent outbreaks and typically releases detailed data that includes information about the age, race and location of the people affected. For the coronavirus pandemic, the CDC has released location and age data, but it has been silent on race. The CDC did not respond to ProPublica's request for race data related to the coronavirus or answer questions about whether they were collecting it at all. Experts say that the nation's unwillingness to publicly track the virus by race could obscure a crucial underlying reality: It's quite likely that a disproportionate number of those who die of coronavirus will be black. The reasons for this are the same reasons that African Americans have disproportionately high rates of maternal death, low levels of access to medical care and higher rates of asthma, said Dr. Camara Jones, a family physician, epidemiologist and visiting fellow at Harvard University. ""COVID is just unmasking the deep disinvestment in our communities, the historical injustices and the impact of residential segregation,"" said Jones, who spent 13 years at the CDC, focused on identifying, measuring and addressing racial bias within the medical system. ""This is the time to name racism as the cause of all of those things. The overrepresentation of people of color in poverty and white people in wealth is not just a happenstance. ‚Ä¶ It's because we're not valued."" Five congressional Democrats wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose department encompasses the CDC, last week demanding the federal government collect and release the breakdown of coronavirus cases by race and ethnicity. Without demographic data, the members of Congress wrote, health officials and lawmakers won't be able to address inequities in health outcomes and testing that may emerge: ""We urge you not to delay collecting this vital information, and to take any additional necessary steps to ensure that all Americans have the access they need to COVID-19 testing and treatment.""   assets.propublica.org  Milwaukee, one of the few places already tracking coronavirus cases and deaths by race, provides an early indication of what would surface nationally if the federal government actually did this, or locally if other cities and states took its lead. Milwaukee, both the city and county, passed resolutions last summer that were seen as important steps in addressing decades of race-based inequality. ""We declared racism as a public health issue,"" said Kowalik, the city's health commissioner. ""It frames not only how we do our work but how transparent we are about how things are going. It impacts how we manage an outbreak."" Milwaukee is trying to be purposeful in how it communicates information about the best way to slow the pandemic. It is addressing economic and logistical roadblocks that stand in the way of safety. And it's being transparent about who is infected, who is dying and how the virus spread in the first place. Kowalik described watching the virus spread into the city, without enough information, because of limited testing, to be able to take early action to contain it. At the beginning of March, Wisconsin had one case. State public health officials still considered the risk from the coronavirus ""low."" Testing criteria was extremely strict, as it was in many places across the country: You had to have symptoms and have traveled to China, Iran, South Korea or Italy within 14 days or have had contact with someone who had a confirmed case of COVID-19. So, she said, she waited, wondering: ""When are we going to be able to test for this to see if it is in our community?"" About two weeks later, Milwaukee had its first case. The city's patient zero had been in contact with a person from a neighboring, predominately white and affluent suburb who had tested positive. Given how much commuting occurs in and out of Milwaukee, with some making a 180-mile round trip to Chicago, Kowalik said she knew it would only be a matter of time before the virus spread into the city. A day later came the city's second case, someone who contracted the virus while in Atlanta. Kowalik said she started questioning the rigidness of the testing guidelines. Why didn't they include domestic travel? By the fourth case, she said, ""we determined community spread. ‚Ä¶ It happened so quickly."" Within the span of a week, Milwaukee went from having one case to nearly 40. Most of the sick people were middle-aged, African American men. By week two, the city had over 350 cases. And now, there are more than 945 cases countywide, with the bulk in the city of Milwaukee, where the population is 39% black. People of all ages have contracted the virus and about half are African American.  assets.propublica.org  The county's online dashboard of coronavirus cases keeps up-to-date information on the racial breakdown of those who have tested positive. As of Thursday morning, 19 people had died of illness related to COVID-19 in Milwaukee County. All but four were black, according to the county medical examiner's office. Records show that at least 11 of the deceased had diabetes, eight had hypertension and 15 had a mixture of chronic health conditions that included heart and lung disease. Because of discrimination and generational income inequality, black households in the county earned only 50% as much as white ones in 2018, according to census statistics. Black people are far less likely to own homes than white people in Milwaukee and far more likely to rent, putting black renters at the mercy of landlords who can kick them out if they can't pay during an economic crisis, at the same time as people are being told to stay home. And when it comes to health insurance, black people are more likely to be uninsured than their white counterparts. African Americans have gravitated to jobs in sectors viewed as reliable paths to the middle class ‚Äî health care, transportation, government, food supply ‚Äî which are now deemed ""essential,"" rendering them unable to stay home. In places like New York City, the virus' epicenter, black people are among the only ones still riding the subway. ""And let's be clear, this is not because people want to live in those conditions,"" said Gordon Francis Goodwin, who works for Government Alliance on Race and Equity, a national racial equity organization that worked with Milwaukee on its health and equity framework. ""This is a matter of taking a look at how our history kept people from actually being fully included."" Fred Royal, head of the Milwaukee branch of the NAACP, knows three people who have died from the virus, including 69-year-old Lenard Wells, a former Milwaukee police lieutenant and a mentor to others in the black community. Royal's 38-year-old cousin died from the virus last week in Atlanta. His body was returned home Tuesday. Royal is hearing that people aren't necessarily being hospitalized but are being sent home instead and ""told to self-medicate."" ""What is alarming about that,"" he said, ""is that a number of those individuals were sent home with symptoms and died before the confirmation of their test came back.""  assets.propublica.org  Health Commissioner Kowalik said that there have been delays of up to two weeks in getting results back from some private labs, but nearly all of those who died have done so at hospitals or while in hospice. Still, Kowalik said she understood why some members in the black community distrusted the care they might receive in a hospital. In January, a 25-year-old day care teacher named Tashonna Ward died after staff at Froedtert Hospital failed to check her vital signs. Federal officials examined 20 patient records and found seven patients, including Ward, didn't receive proper care. The report didn't reveal the race of those whose records it examined at the hospital, which predominantly serves black patients. Froedtert Hospital declined to speak to issues raised in the report, according to a February article from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and it had not submitted any corrective actions to federal officials. ""What black folks are accustomed to in Milwaukee and anywhere in the country, really, is pain not being acknowledged and constant inequities that happen in health care delivery,"" Kowalik said. The health commissioner herself, a black woman who grew up in Milwaukee, said she's all too familiar with the city's enduring struggles with segregation and racism. Her mother is black and her father Polish, and she remembers the stories they shared about trying to buy a house as a young interracial couple in Sherman Park, a neighborhood once off-limits to blacks. ""My father couldn't get a mortgage for the house. He had to go to the bank without my mom,"" Kowalik said. It is the same neighborhood where fury and frustration sparked protests that, at times, roiled into riots in 2016 when a Milwaukee police officer fatally shot Sylville Smith, a 23-year-old black man. And it is the same neighborhood that has a concentration of poor health outcomes when you overlay a heat map of conditions, be it lead poisoning, infant mortality ‚Äî and now, she said, COVID-19. Knowing which communities are most impacted allows public health officials to tailor their messaging to overcome the distrust of black residents. ""We've been told so much misinformation over the years about the condition of our community,"" Royal, of the NAACP, said. ""I believe a lot of people don't trust what the government says."" Kowalik has met ‚Äî virtually ‚Äî with trusted and influential community leaders to discuss outreach efforts to ensure everyone is on the same page about the importance of staying home and keeping 6 feet away from others if they must go out. Police and inspectors are responding to complaints received about ""noncompliant"" businesses forcing staff to come to work or not practicing social distancing in the workplace. Violators could face fines. ""Who are we getting these complaints from?"" she asked. ""Many people of color."" Residents have been urged to call 211 if they need help with anything from finding something to eat or a place to stay. And the state has set up two voluntary isolation facilities for people with COVID-19 symptoms whose living situations are untenable, including a Super 8 motel in Milwaukee. Despite the work being done in Milwaukee, experts like Linda Sprague Martinez, a community health researcher at Boston University's School of Social Work, worry that the government is not paying close enough attention to race, and as the disease spreads, will do too little to blunt its toll. ""When COVID-19 passes and we see the losses ‚Ä¶ it will be deeply tied to the story of post-World War II policies that left communities marginalized,"" Sprague said. ""Its impact is going to be tied to our history and legacy of racial inequities. It's going to be tied to the fact that we live in two very different worlds.""

The past few weeks have see nations dishing out billions and instituting lockdowns to combat the virus. In a bid to join forces against the virus, French president Emmanuel Macron had a conference call on Friday with key African heads of state. They included; Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, DR Congo, Egypt, Mali, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Key issues discussed included the need for Africa to stand together, speak with one voice and work through financial institutions to mobilize resources and harmonise the support from international partners. Significantly absent at the conference call, was Cameroon‚Äôs President Paul Biya who has gone incognito for the past weeks. Despite attempts from communication Minister, Emmanuel Sadi to dismiss rumours of Biya‚Äôs death, demands for physical proof keep increasing. After Biya failed to heed to a seven-day ultimatum by the CRM‚Äôs Kamto to address Cameroonians in person, he has been given another seven days to proof he is in control. In case Biya fails to do so, ‚Äúwe would be forced to initiate adequate legal procedures to obtain confirmation, by the competent bodies, of the presidential vacancy and its constitutional consequences‚Äù Kamto says. While it is unlikely that the President will respond, many believe his surprising absence from Macron‚Äôs conference call may be a signal of deteriorating relations with France or even more.

Following the devastation of covid-19 unleashed on the West by the coronavirus outbreak, many warned and feared Africa could be extinct should the pandemic spread to the continent. The fears are because the continent‚Äôs healthcare systems are inadequate, coupled with lack of funding, insufficient trained health personnel as well as lack of equipment.

African countries in meeting with WHO - The Malta Independent"," The European Region does not exist in a vacuum and due consideration must be given to our immediate neighbours along the North African Coast, especially countries like Libya, affected by social problems and civil strife, Malta‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health said during a World Health Organisation (WHO) EURO ministerial briefing.  The problems in Northern Africa will impact the European Region, so we must give these countries due consideration and solidarity, Chris Fearne said.  Fearne was invited to share Malta‚Äôs transition planning strategy, during the WHO EURO ministerial meeting, in light of Malta‚Äôs low transmission rate which has not overwhelmed our healthcare system.  He was one of three Ministers asked to address 53 Health Ministers, in light of the fact that Malta is being considered as ‚Äúan example to follow,‚Äù as has been publicly stated by WHO European Director, Hans Kluge.  The Health Ministry has already put together a transition team that will be in charge of handling all medical appointments which have been postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Malta, and provide a contingency plan for a way forward, Fearne said on last week‚Äôs edition of Indepth.  Fearne noted that the three main health entities in the world - WHO, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CBC) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) - are recognising the steps that the Maltese health authorities are taking with regard to COVID-19, so much so that they are turning to Malta for advice.  ""Something which is beautiful, yet scary, is the fact that we usually call them for advice, but now they are contacting us to get pointers on what to do. This is great as it validates the decisions we are taking but it is scary because we are used to asking them for advice, but they are not able to provide it,"" he said.  During the ministerial meeting, Fearne insisted that transition is still at an early phase, despite decreasing numbers, as the pandemic will not be over until a vaccine is available to the global population and there is sufficient herd immunity.  He explained that Malta is planning a schedule of how to start re-engaging with non-COVID patients since in our pandemic preparedness Malta has diverted a large number of human resources to deal with the COVID response, at the expense of non-COVID services.  ‚ÄúWe are looking at ways of re-introducing these services, ensuring vigilance is maintained as we ensure a balance of resources to cope well with both the COVID and non-COVID patients,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe have defined our maximum capacities for bed space including ITU care, which does not include just beds and ventilators, but the required human resources. This while ensuring that the reproductive factor [Rt] and the peak of the epidemic curve are maintained at a value at which our maximum capacity is not exceeded at any point‚Äù.  Fearne also made reference to the collaboration of the general public, which requires a good communication strategy, and stated that this was one of the areas in which Malta managed to excel in ‚Äì by constantly keeping the public informed.  In closing, Kluge thanked participating ministers and reiterated DPM Fearne‚Äôs words in respect of the transition, ‚Äúnot speed, but safety...and solidarity.‚Äù       ‚ÄòRegeneration must continue‚Äô, Abela‚Ä¶ Group wants Malta to take in 32‚Ä¶ WATCH: Malta‚Äôs new Cabinet members give‚Ä¶ PM Abela announces new 24-person‚Ä¶ Government reports deficit of ‚Ç¨1.2‚Ä¶ ADPD submits constitutional bid for‚Ä¶ ‚Ç¨45,000 temporary ramp near fast ferry‚Ä¶ 717 new cases of Covid-19 reported as‚Ä¶ Independent Online. ¬©2022.

Learn More{{/message}} Submitting‚Ä¶ Washington Monthly When I looked into coronavirus hotspots in rural parts of the country, one area stood out: the southwestern part of Georgia. An outbreak started in the town of Albany and seems to have spread through most of the surrounding counties. Here is what the map of per capita cases and deaths looks like in southeastern states. The southwestern part of Georgia rivals the New Orleans area as a hot spot. Georgia ranks 14th among states when it comes to the number of coronavirus cases per capita. Nevertheless, Governor Brian Kemp took the first step to open the state‚Äôs economy on Monday. He did so even though Georgia doesn‚Äôt meet the minimalist conditions outlined by the White House for taking the first step. Why would a Republican governor be so cavalier about the lives of rural residents in his state? One factor to consider requires us to jettison the notion that when we talk about rural residents, we mean white people. To get some idea of the racial makeup of southwestern Georgia, take a look at a map of something called ‚Äúthe black belt,‚Äù which is the part of former confederate states that was dominated by slave plantations. As an example, the city of Albany, Georgia is over 70 percent African American. Here is a map documenting the percentage of African Americans in all of Georgia‚Äôs counties. What we see is that, other than Atlanta, the coronavirus hotspots in Georgia are centered in rural areas and small towns with large populations of African Americans. All of this begs the question of whether a racist disregard for the lives of African Americans is affecting Governor Kemp‚Äôs decision to re-open the economy. Another factor that needs to be considered is that Governor Kemp isn‚Äôt the brightest bulb. As an example, it wasn‚Äôt until early April that he learned that the coronavirus can be spread by those who are asymptomatic. Kemp is also the guy who ran ads like this.  What Georgia got in the 2018 governor‚Äôs election was a racist who isn‚Äôt the sharpest knife in the drawer. If you ever wanted an example (other than Trump) of the way white male privilege fails to put enough obstacles in the path of incompetent men, there you have it. It‚Äôs worth remembering what Georgians could have had. Georgia: 14th highest infection/7th lowest testing rate; less econ resilient & 1000s of low-wage workers already forced to risk their lives to make a living. Weakened healthcare w/closed rural hospitals, no Medicaid expansion & a doctor shortage. Reopen? Dangerously incompetent. https://t.co/FFfk9EoN3l ‚Äî Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) April 20, 2020 It is very likely that voter suppression played a role in Kemp‚Äôs election.

And African Americans now represent 57% of all COVID-19 deaths in Chicago. In just the last two-weeks, the number of black victims has tripled. CBS 2 Investigator Dorothy Tucker first identified five hot spots using maps CBS 2 created. Now, she's digging deeper into the data and found in the neighborhoods where the victims lived, many have essential jobs that increase their chances of being exposed to the deadly virus. Look no further than the blue points on the map. These are people who died of coronavirus. Most of them live in Chicago's black communities, the hot spots for COVID-19 deaths. When CBS 2 first took a look two weeks ago, five neighborhoods had the worse deaths: South Shore, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Austin and Chatham. It was bad then. It is worse now. Englewood is leading the way. The numbers of deaths have jumped from six to 23 as of last Friday. South Shore is almost as bad: seven deaths two weeks ago. By the weekend 22. Auburn Gresham, Chatham and Austin neighborhoods, all identified as hot spots, have also seen increases. A common thread among those who died: where they work. ""When we consider the types of positions that black Americans hold, many of them are on the front lines in essential roles related to food delivery, groceries work, transportation, delivery,"" said epidemiologist Dr. Mercedes Carnethon of Northwestern Medicine. The data CBS 2 pulled reflects the reality. In Austin, where 19 people died, nearly 11% of those employed work in transportation. That's nearly 3,500 people. In Englewood, nearly 12% of those employed, or just over 2,000 people, also work transportation jobs. Another 1,200 work in food preparation. Consider the case of young adult working: A 30 to 40 years old grocery store worker. ""He or she does not have symptoms but they're talking, they are providing care for younger children, they are providing care for elders. There is no amount of cleaning within a household that can stop the spread through ordinary interactions and discussions,"" Carnethon said. MAP: The Most Covid Deaths In Chicago Happened In These Neighborhoods Another popular job in those black communities: people who work in health care as kitchen helpers or janitors.

"170",3246,"https://ihorror.com/tsavo-man-eaters-the-serial-killer-lions-of-african-legend/","Tsavo Man-Eaters: The Serial Killer Lions of African Legend","We all know that humans can be serial killers, but there was a documented case in Tsavo East Africa in the late 1800s which tells of two man-eating lions leaving a deadly path of human carnage in their wake. Some say although the lions made meals of most of their victims, they might have hunted for sport too because humans don‚Äôt fit into their normal dietary needs which calls for higher amounts of protein and larger bones. The story was the basis of a movie starring Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer called The Ghost and the Darkness, which itself took artistic liberty with the written, terrifying eyewitness accounts by Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson in his book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo. Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in ‚ÄúThe Ghost and the Darkness.‚Äù Patterson, an engineer, was commissioned in 1898 to oversee the construction of a bridge that would span over the Tsavo River for the British railroad. But his mission was delayed several times by two male lions that had developed an odd taste for his staff. Several thousand workers were employed by Patterson to build the bridge. They lived in an expansive makeshift town consisting of tents and structures which offered very little protection against the harsh savanna ecosystem. The rogue lions were a part of this biotic community. Unlike their well-known Serengeti counterparts, Tsavo males can be identified by their maneless heads, a detail missing from the movie.  It wasn‚Äôt long before Patterson settled into his new surroundings when these bold felines began to attack his men. They would prowl around the encampment, taking turns pulling men from their tents ripping them apart from limb to limb. This went on for a while until the cats stopped showing up, only to return with a vengeance a few months later. Upon their return, they increased their murderous rampage. The cats successfully traversed any traps, scare tactics or barbed fencing the men could come up with. What‚Äôs more, the cats were working in tandem now. Scared for their lives construction workers abandoned the project bringing production to a stand still. Completely overwhelmed and sorely behind schedule, British officials were determined to get rid of these maneating pests. Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas in ‚ÄúThe Ghost and the Darkness.‚Äù Enter about 20 Indian armed soldiers who did nothing but agitate the cats even further, it was Patterson they wanted and in their pursuit of him, managed to avoid the hired guns. Which begs the question: Can animals hold a personal vendetta? These two did according to Patterson. They had become angered at his constant meddling and gunfire. In defiance, he managed to shoot one cat in the leg. It ran off but despite its wound, returned with a thirst for Patterson‚Äôs blood. It was man versus beast until Patterson got the upper hand, took aim and struck the lion in the heart with a bullet, killing it. The beast was over 9-feet-long and required the help of several men to carry it away. The second lion met with the deadly end of Patterson‚Äôs rifle but like its brother also managed to survive, fleeing into the savanna wounded and angry. Eleven days later Patterson found it and shot it 6 more times, once fatally in the head. Patterson said the cat, even while dying, pawed at a tree branch trying to reach him before taking its last breath. In all, the cats managed to kill about 135 people, although scientists argue that the number is hyperbolic and lies somewhere in the dozens. The two cats actually had help from a third, but it was killed before Patterson‚Äôs arrival and therefore undocumented. The giant pelts of Patterson‚Äôs spoils would become his household throw rugs for many years before they were sold to the Field Museum in Chicago for $5,000. Curators eventually stuffed them to make a lifelike diorama.  As for why the big cats would hunt human flesh, one Tsavo cat researcher, Bruce Patterson (unrelated to John), said in an interview, they might have done so ‚Äúbecause we are slower, weaker and more defenseless.‚Äù You can read James Henry Patterson‚Äôs full account in his book, The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.  @2021 - All Right Reserved.","none","none",0,0,0,0

"173",3273,"https://gizmodo.com/three-african-skeletons-found-in-mexico-show-horrors-of-1843177914","Three African Skeletons Found in Mexico Show Horrors of Early Slavery in the New World","Three skeletons belonging to African individuals have been uncovered at a mass grave in Mexico City. They represent some of the first African people to be forcibly relocated to the New World. An interdisciplinary analysis of these remains is shedding new light on this grim period of history and the harsh conditions endured by the first wave of enslaved Africans in the Americas. ‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, they are the earliest genetically identified first-generation Africans in the Americas,‚Äù according to the authors of a new paper, published today in Current Biology. Found in Mexico City, the three skeletons were buried in a mass grave near the former site of the Hospital Real de San Jos√© de los Naturales. This early hospital dates back to the early colonial period of New Spain and was primarily used to treat indigenous peoples. All three skeletons date back to this early colonial period in the 16th century, which means these individuals were among the first wave of Africans to be kidnapped and brought to the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade. An interdisciplinary analysis of these remains paints a bleak picture of their lives, showing evidence of forged migration, physical abuse, and exposure to infectious diseases. ‚ÄúBy investigating the origin and disease experience of these individuals through molecular methods and evaluating the skeleton[s] for signs of life experience and cultural affinity, we illuminate, in some measure, the identity, culture, and life of these people whose history has largely been lost,‚Äù wrote the authors in the new study, co-authored by Johannes Krause from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. Game like a proRazer leads the race on sick PC gaming accessories and you can find discounts on a ton of controllers, mice, keyboards, headsets, chairs, and more. The origin of this story goes back to 1518, when Charles I of Spain authorized the transfer of enslaved Africans to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which at the time included most of what is now Mexico, the Caribbean, and parts of the U.S. and Canada. By 1779, an estimated 130,000 to 150,000 Africans had been forcibly relocated to the Viceroyalty, according to the researchers. Of these, some 70,000 arrived between 1600 and 1640. Writing in the new paper, the authors explained the sudden increase in relocation of enslaved individuals: ...in part due to a reduction in the indigenous labor force that resulted from both casualties in the many conflicts during the European conquest and from diseases (among them, small-pox, measles, and typhoid fever) that devastated nearly 90% of the native population. Creoles, Africans, mulattoes, and other African-descended groups were thought to have higher resistance to these diseases compared to Indigenous Americans and Europeans making them desirable assets. Further to this, Las Leyes Nuevas (The New Laws) of 1542 prohibited the use of Native American labor as slaves in New Spain. To analyze the three skeletons, the authors combined genetic and isotopic evidence, along with physical evidence gleaned from the remains. Proof that these people came from Africa came from multiple sources. First, their upper teeth showed evidence of decorative filing, a known cultural practice of some African tribes. Second, these three individuals shared a Y-chromosome lineage that is strongly correlated to people from sub-Saharan Africa and is now the most common genetic lineage among living African Americans. And thirdly, dental isotopes extracted from their teeth showed that the individuals were born outside of Mexico, having spent their entire youth in Africa, according to the research. Analysis of the skeletons suggests these people were subjected to physical abuse and intense manual labor, such as muscle-derived patterns on bones and signs of hernia on vertebrae. Other evidence pointed to ‚Äúnutritionally inadequate diets, anemia, parasitic infectious diseases, and blood loss,‚Äù wrote the authors. These enslaved Africans were also victims of extreme violence. One skeleton had five copper buckshots fired from a gun, while another showed signs of skull and leg fractures. None of these injuries resulted in their deaths, but all three died prematurely. ‚ÄúAnd since they were found in this mass burial site, these individuals likely died in one of the first epidemic events in Mexico City,‚Äù explained Rodrigo Barquera, the first author of the study and a graduate student at MPI SHH, in a press release. ‚Äú[We] can tell they survived the maltreatment that they received. Their story is one of difficulty but also strength, because although they suffered a lot, they persevered and were resistant to the changes forced upon them.‚Äù The analysis also resulted in the detection of two known pathogens, namely the virus responsible for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the bacterium responsible for yaws (Treponema pallidum pertenue), which causes symptoms similar to syphilis. Importantly, this is the earliest evidence of HBV and yaws in the Americas. ‚ÄúAlthough we have no indication that the HBV lineage we found established itself in Mexico, this is the first direct evidence of HBV introduction as the result of the transatlantic slave trade,‚Äù said Denise K√ºhnert, a co-author of the study and an expert in infectious diseases at MPI SHH. ‚ÄúThis provides novel insight into the... history of the pathogen.‚Äù The same could hold true for yaws, which was common in the Americas during the colonial period. Prior to the new study, however, the oldest genetic evidence of yaws came from a 17th-century European colonist. ‚ÄúIt is plausible that yaws was not only brought into the Americas through the transatlantic slave trade but may subsequently have had a considerable impact on the disease dynamics in Latin America,‚Äù added K√ºhnert. Archaeologists in Egypt have uncovered four unique child graves at Gebel el-Silsila‚Äîthe site of a‚Ä¶ Needless to say, this is among the trickier aspects of the new study; linking the presence of HBV and yaws in these individuals to the spread of diseases from Africa to the Americas is a precarious proposition at best. Future research is needed. The new paper presents a devastating snapshot of life during the early colonial period and the tremendous hardships endured by the tens of thousands of people abducted from Africa. Clarification: The first paragraph of this article has been updated to emphasize that African people were brought to the Americas against their will.","none","none",0,0,1,1

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appears on a new episode of Smith‚Äôs Snapchat show Will at Home, airing Wednesday, to answer questions about the virus from Smith and kids aged 5 to 16. Smith, 51, asked Fauci if ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a comprehension as to why‚Äù the African American community has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In Louisiana, for example, 70 percent of the state‚Äôs COVID-19 cases had been in African Americans on April 7, despite making up just 32 percent of the state‚Äôs population. The same is true in Chicago, where 72 percent of cases had been in African Americans while they represent just 30 percent of the population. RELATED: Early Data Shows Black Communities Disproportionately Affected by Coronavirus in Some States Fauci said that African Americans are hurt by the ‚Äúdisparities‚Äù in the health care available to them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really terrible, because it‚Äôs just one of the failings of our society, that African Americans have a disproportionate prevalence in incidents of the very comorbid conditions that put you at a high risk,‚Äù Fauci told Smith. RELATED VIDEO: Nurse Shares Photos From the COVID-19 Pandemic Frontline: We Have Become ‚ÄòCloser Than Ever‚Äô Those conditions include hypertension, obesity, diabetes and asthma, Fauci said, and they all put African American people at a higher risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19. ‚ÄúIf you get infected, you‚Äôre going to have a poor outcome,‚Äù Fauci said, adding that the pandemic is focusing ‚Äúa bright shining light on what disparities of health mean.‚Äù RELATED: Obesity Is One of the Highest Risk Factors for Severe Coronavirus ‚Äî Especially for Young Adults Smith also had Fauci answer questions from kids and teens via video.

According to the police report, the teenage girl said the African male first spoke to her at the Dachau train station at 10 p.m on a train headed for Munich. After becoming uncomfortable with the encounter, she fled to another part of the train, prompting the Eritrean male to follow her. After sitting next to her, he began stroking her legs and tried to kiss her in her genital area. She tried to flee again, but he grabbed her and reached under her T-shirt and pants. She struggled free again, but he told her at the R√∂hrmoos S-Bahn stop that she should get out with him and threatened her. He then tried to grab her arm and took her cell phone. When she refused to go with him, he threw her cell phone back on the train and fled from the scene. The girl then ran to another part of the train where another man helped her. The good Samaritan got out with the 15-year-old at the Vierkirchen station and informed the police what occurred. In the vicinity of the R√∂hrmoos train station, Dauchau police officers apprehended the 31-year-old Eritrean suspect who lives in the Dachau district. The federal police are investigating the Eritrean for sexual harassment and threats. The 15-year-old girl identified the suspect by sight after he was in custody. In response to the comments posted on Twitter regarding police using a white male for its crime report, the Bavarian police commented on the thread, saying they would discuss the matter internally.

Margaret Brennan: Even though they make up just 30 percent of the city‚Äôs population. Why is this having such a heavy toll in the black community? Lori Lightfoot: Well, this is an issue that‚Äôs not unique to Chicago, unfortunately. We‚Äôre seeing similar kinds of numbers reported across the country in large urban centers. And the answer that we believe is right is because of the underlying conditions that people of color and particularly black folks suffer from, whether it‚Äôs diabetes, heart disease, upper respiratory illnesses. The kind of things that we‚Äôve been talking about for a long time that plague black Chicago, that lead to life expectancy gaps. This virus attacks those underlying conditions with a vengeance. Just this morning, I learned of a man that I know well, African American had an underlying condition and went very quickly as a result of the coronavirus. So it is devastating our community. Margaret Brennan: What you said got the attention of the White House, as well as the surgeon general said from the podium that black Americans are not biologically or genetically predisposed. This is socially predisposed because of pre-existing health issues. Lori Lightfoot: Right. Margaret Brennan: He rattled off a number of other factors. The point being, this is so layered in complexity. How do you, as a mayor, start chipping away at this? Lori Lightfoot: Well, you start by making sure that you‚Äôve got the data. One of the first things that we did is made sure that we issued an order to require all providers who were doing testing not to skip providing demographic information. We need to be able to accurately understand the impact of this virus. So that‚Äôs one. Get the data, share the data and then what we also put in place was a racial equity rapid response team. So this is a team of healthcare providers, public health clinicians, as well as stakeholders in community- faith community, block clubs. We have street intervention folks who normally work on responding to violence. We are going all in in a hyper local focus to make sure that we are tapping into those neighborhoods where there‚Äôs a high death rate, where there‚Äôs a high positive test rate. And we are bringing people into healthcare systems and making those kind of connections that may not have otherwise existed. But that‚Äôs the kind of hyper-local focus, along with some other measures that we‚Äôre doing to disabuse people of the myth that was circulating up until recently, that black people actually couldn‚Äôt get coronavirus. Margaret Brennan: One of the other stats that stood out is that so many essential workers, frontline workers,‚Äì Lori Lightfoot: Yes. Margaret Brennan: -are people of color.

By Kathryn Morgan, Ph.D., Professor of Criminal Justice and Director of the African American Studies Program The UAB African American Studies Program will celebrate its 20th anniversary on April 28, 2020. The program was approved as a degree-granting program by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education on April 28, 2000. At the time of its inception, the UAB African American Studies Program was the only one of its kind in the Southeast and is still only one of two degree-granting African American Studies (AAS) programs in Alabama. In the 1970s, Dr. Horace Huntley taught the first Black History courses at UAB, and in the 1990s, Dr. Virginia Whatley Smith worked diligently to implement the first organized African American Studies Program. When it was approved as a program on April 28, 2000, Smith was appointed as the first Director. Coker AdeniyiAfter Smith left the University, Dr. Niyi Coker, associate professor of Theater, was named program director. Under Coker‚Äôs leadership, the program grew in size and visibility. During his tenure as director, he explored the possibility of a shared AAS program with the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. When Coker left in 2005 to accept a Distinguished Professorship at the University of Missouri, Dr. Dellita Ogunsula became interim director and continued to pursue this endeavor. Leaders of both the UAB and UA African American Studies programs envisioned that a shared program would be advantageous to the University of Alabama System. The vision of the program was to implement a unique shared course of study that led to the completion of a Bachelor of Arts degree in African American Studies at both universities. In 2009, the joint UAB-UA program was approved by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE). After meeting several post-implementation conditions, the shared program was re-accredited by ACHE in 2014-2015. Dellita OgunsulaSince 2005, Dr. Dellita Ogunsula, Dr. Jacqueline Wood, and Dr. George Munchus served as interim program directors and made significant contributions to the advancement of the program. Dr. Kay Morgan was appointed as program director in 2013. After graduating its first student, Angela Craig, with a BA in AAS in 2001, the AAS program has established itself as a program committed to producing scholars and citizens who are equipped to effectively, critically, and actively engage the world and create positive change. Graduates of the program today reflect the remarkable opportunities afforded by completing a BA in African American Studies. Program graduates have gone on to excel in careers in many fields including social and behavioral sciences, medicine, education, and engineering. Twenty years after its launch, the UAB African American Studies Program continues to walk in the spirit of the black intellectual tradition. Dedicated to the critical study of the lived experiences, culture, and history of people in Africa and the African diaspora, it offers a major and minor, and students are able to choose from one of three areas of interest: Global Public Health and Social Justice, Historical Investigation and Social Awareness, and History and Culture of Afro-Caribbean and Latino People. Kathryn MorganThe AAS program, while focusing on the experience of African-descended people in the United States, has also provided a critical understanding of the cultural, historical, and social value and experiences of people of African descent across the African diaspora. Unlike other programs, the program‚Äôs focus is anchored in, but not limited to, history and the social and behavioral sciences. Students in this program receive a well-rounded, coherent body of knowledge that expands their fields of knowledge by including courses in public health, music, literature, and language. Students in the program develop their critical thinking skills and enhance their reading, writing, and public speaking skills, allowing them to engage in critical discourse concerning people of African descent. Students in the program are better prepared to enter various fields such as medicine, education, law, non-profit sector, arts, and public health because of their interdisciplinary training. And the AAS program‚Äôs location in Alabama, which holds a significant place in American history, underscores the importance of its presence in and contribution to the University. This fall, the program hopes to host several celebrations to honor the students, faculty, and staff who have helped the program develop and thrive at UAB.

His engaging personality and encyclopedic knowledge of antiques would grab ahold of every customer, prompting new friendships and sparking dynamic conversations. Fred DyessIf you ever stepped foot inside of Avondale Antiques in Birmingham, Alabama, you surely met owner Fred Dyess. His engaging personality and encyclopedic knowledge of antiques would grab ahold of every customer, prompting new friendships and sparking dynamic conversations. ‚ÄúHe was an interesting person with a lot of different hobbies,‚Äù said Seth Dyess, Fred‚Äôs son. ‚ÄúHe was always willing to help people.‚Äù Fred nurtured his interest in antiques and history as he traveled the country as a young man. He grew up in Saraland, Alabama; moved to Waynesboro, Mississippi; then settled in Houston, Texas for several years. While in Houston, Fred met his wife Judy Flowers Dyess, and they began to build a life together. ‚ÄúThroughout his travels, he gained a passion for history,‚Äù said Seth. Along with his journeys, Fred also explored several career fields, including landscaping and sales. When Fred and Judy moved to Birmingham, he made a major life decision and enrolled in college. He selected the University of Alabama at Birmingham and, after taking a few courses, decided to pursue his academic passion: history. According to Seth, his father was a first-generation college student, which is why he held a special place in his heart for UAB. ‚Äú[Many UAB students] are doing everything they can, which is what my father did,‚Äù said Seth. Over time, Fred put his business-sense and love for history into practice, and, in 2015, he opened a mid-century community institution simply known as Avondale Antiques. When spending time in his store, Fred was more than a salesman. He was a guide‚Äîsomeone who could help you curate a room, while also providing historical context for a rattan chair or a mid-century buffet. In some cases, Fred would personally drive a piece to a customer‚Äôs home, carry it inside, and help arrange it. Clearly, he loved his work. Sadly, on January 2, 2022, Fred passed away after battling COVID-19. The painful news reverberated through his community of friends, supporters, and customers, many of whom shared heartfelt memories of Fred on the Avondale Antiques Facebook page and elsewhere. While still grieving, Seth sought a way to honor his life and legacy. Given his father‚Äôs love for history and UAB, Seth established the Fred Dyess Endowed Student Award in History. ‚ÄúIt honors him,‚Äù said Seth. ‚ÄúFor someone who is working and raising kids and is trying to go to school, [this scholarship] will hopefully ease the burden.‚Äù Through this scholarship, Seth and his family may help another first-generation college student invest in their love for history and fulfill their dreams. The College of Arts and Sciences and the Department of History deeply appreciate this new scholarship and offer condolences to the Dyess family. More information about the Fred Dyess Endowed Student Award in History is available here.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham‚Äôs (UAB) College of Arts and Science is offering two new minors for undergraduate students. The Department of Political Science and Public Administration recently launched the Public Management and Policy Minor. According to Rob Blanton, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration (PSPA), ‚ÄúThe department‚Äôs Master of Public Administration (MPA) program has a long history of providing graduate and professional students some of the necessary skills to succeed in the management of public and nonprofit organizations, two large and vibrant sectors within our economy.‚Äù PSPA faculty reflected on the MPA program‚Äôs successes and established a clear goal for the new minor: to build some of the same key skills and competencies for undergraduate students. The minor can thus provide a strong foundation for future graduate work in public management or give students valuable skills to help them in their career journeys. The College is also excited to announce the new Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Studies Minor. This minor is focused on material, intellectual, sociopolitical, literary, and linguistic approaches to the Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance periods. According to Walter Ward, Ph.D., professor in the Department of History, ‚ÄúStudents will learn current theories and methods for working with a range of source materials and objects, from archaeological finds and architecture to historical documents and poetry.‚Äù The interdisciplinary program combines the fields of history, literature, archaeology, anthropology, art history, philosophy, cultural studies, economics, and more to understand the premodern world. All courses are taught by faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences. You can learn more about both programs by visiting the Undergraduate Course Catalog Addenda.

The program was approved as a degree-granting program by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education on April 28, 2000. By Kathryn Morgan, Ph.D., Professor of Criminal Justice and Director of the African American Studies Program The UAB African American Studies Program will celebrate its 20th anniversary on April 28, 2020. The program was approved as a degree-granting program by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education on April 28, 2000. At the time of its inception, the UAB African American Studies Program was the only one of its kind in the Southeast and is still only one of two degree-granting African American Studies (AAS) programs in Alabama. In the 1970s, Dr. Horace Huntley taught the first Black History courses at UAB, and in the 1990s, Dr. Virginia Whatley Smith worked diligently to implement the first organized African American Studies Program. When it was approved as a program on April 28, 2000, Smith was appointed as the first Director. Coker AdeniyiAfter Smith left the University, Dr. Niyi Coker, associate professor of Theater, was named program director. Under Coker‚Äôs leadership, the program grew in size and visibility. During his tenure as director, he explored the possibility of a shared AAS program with the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. When Coker left in 2005 to accept a Distinguished Professorship at the University of Missouri, Dr. Dellita Ogunsula became interim director and continued to pursue this endeavor. Leaders of both the UAB and UA African American Studies programs envisioned that a shared program would be advantageous to the University of Alabama System. The vision of the program was to implement a unique shared course of study that led to the completion of a Bachelor of Arts degree in African American Studies at both universities. In 2009, the joint UAB-UA program was approved by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE). After meeting several post-implementation conditions, the shared program was re-accredited by ACHE in 2014-2015. Dellita OgunsulaSince 2005, Dr. Dellita Ogunsula, Dr. Jacqueline Wood, and Dr. George Munchus served as interim program directors and made significant contributions to the advancement of the program. Dr. Kay Morgan was appointed as program director in 2013. After graduating its first student, Angela Craig, with a BA in AAS in 2001, the AAS program has established itself as a program committed to producing scholars and citizens who are equipped to effectively, critically, and actively engage the world and create positive change. Graduates of the program today reflect the remarkable opportunities afforded by completing a BA in African American Studies. Program graduates have gone on to excel in careers in many fields including social and behavioral sciences, medicine, education, and engineering. Twenty years after its launch, the UAB African American Studies Program continues to walk in the spirit of the black intellectual tradition. Dedicated to the critical study of the lived experiences, culture, and history of people in Africa and the African diaspora, it offers a major and minor, and students are able to choose from one of three areas of interest: Global Public Health and Social Justice, Historical Investigation and Social Awareness, and History and Culture of Afro-Caribbean and Latino People. Kathryn MorganThe AAS program, while focusing on the experience of African-descended people in the United States, has also provided a critical understanding of the cultural, historical, and social value and experiences of people of African descent across the African diaspora. Unlike other programs, the program‚Äôs focus is anchored in, but not limited to, history and the social and behavioral sciences. Students in this program receive a well-rounded, coherent body of knowledge that expands their fields of knowledge by including courses in public health, music, literature, and language. Students in the program develop their critical thinking skills and enhance their reading, writing, and public speaking skills, allowing them to engage in critical discourse concerning people of African descent. Students in the program are better prepared to enter various fields such as medicine, education, law, non-profit sector, arts, and public health because of their interdisciplinary training. And the AAS program‚Äôs location in Alabama, which holds a significant place in American history, underscores the importance of its presence in and contribution to the University. This fall, the program hopes to host several celebrations to honor the students, faculty, and staff who have helped the program develop and thrive at UAB.

Pieter van Wyk filmed the lions as they spotted the large shadow cast by his jeep and made their way over to escape the glaring sun. Soon the 34-year-old found himself closely surrounded by the pride in the 15,000-hectare MalaMala Game Reserve in Mpumalanga. He was forced to sit it out and wait for the sun to move and the shadow to shrink, before the lions finally started to disappear and he could move on. The pride 22 lions surround the game rangers car as they seek to stay out the sun on a blazing day in South Africa The lions spot Pieter's car while roaming the 5,000-hectare MalaMala Game Reserve in Mpumalanga One female lion pants in the shade of Pieter's car first before the rest of the pride begin skulking over. She looks directly at the ranger as he says: 'They passed by our vehicles and this ended up being their chosen spot, as you can see.' The lions line up one-by-one in the shade behind his car with each sticking their heads up to look over at him while he films. He jokes that this is 'South African problems', although it is unclear whether he means the hot sun or the 22 predators keeping him in his car. The first female lion to lie down in the shade looks up while panting at Pieter as he films her The rest of pride sit behind her while she continues to curiously gaze at Pieter in his car Pieter said: 'It was late morning and the mercury levels were rising as the sun climbed higher into the sky. 'The lions, Africa's apex predators, were on the hunt not for food, but for shade. 'They decided that the shadow cast by my vehicle would do just fine. 'It is not uncommon during hot days on MalaMala Game Reserve and it was their decision to come into my 'personal space'. 'Animals have right of way so I had to wait. But it wasn't too long before the shadow got too small and they moved on.' Pieter can Wyk, 34, took the film as part of the Rangers in Isolation series to showcase MalaMala's wildlife to people stuck at home during the lockdown The moment was filmed as part of a series called Rangers in Isolation which sees rangers share videos of game drives and field work online during the lockdown. They hope people who wanted to visit MalaMala but were unable to due to the pandemic can still see the African bush and some incredible natural encounters. The reserve is home to the 'Big Five' animals - lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses and Cape buffalo - as well as cheetahs, hyenas, giraffes, hippos and wild dogs. It also housed Tjololo, a famous leopard who starred in the National Geographic documentary Stalking Leopards, until he died in October, 2007.

Next up for the Utah Valley grad: Qualifying for the Olympics.","(Photo courtesy of Akwasi Frimpong) Ghanan slider Akwasi Frimpong, right, and coach Zach Lund celebrate Frimpong's victory in the international race at the 2020 Western Regionals at Utah Olympic Park near Park City on Feb. 29, 2020. The Salt Lake City skeleton racer's win was also Africa's first sliding victory. Close to nothing went right for Akwasi Frimpong when he became the first African athlete to win an elite-level sliding competition. And maybe that‚Äôs a good thing. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have meant as much to the Salt Lake City skeleton racer if everything had set up perfectly On Feb. 29, back before the world was turned upside down by the coronavirus, Frimpong arrived at the track at the Utah Olympic Park near Park City with a broken sled, a battered body and a dented ego. His helmet, too, was misshapen ‚Äî the result of being left too long on a heater ‚Äî but he didn‚Äôt notice that until he had entered the starting box and triggered a timer counting down the seconds to his first run. Still, propelled by someone else‚Äôs faith in his dream, Frimpong, 34, flew faster than he ever had before. And just like that, the Utah Valley University graduate‚Äôs goal of making, and perhaps even medaling in, the 2022 Olympics in Beijing suddenly seemed real again. ‚ÄúNo African has ever won a skeleton event before in history,‚Äù said Frimpong, who represented his birth country of Ghana in the 2018 Olympics. ‚ÄúBut the most important thing wasn‚Äôt being first and making history. The most important thing was that I am on track for 2022.‚Äù In terms of prestige, the USA Western Regionals had very little. It basically served as a Team USA selection camp with the international competition as a sideshow. Winners weren‚Äôt even presented with medals. That made the atmosphere around it relaxed, though. In turn, Frimpong felt at ease. So, despite his laundry list of issues, he set a personal record of 50.69 seconds on that opening run. Added to an only slightly slower second run, he achieved the fastest combined time in an event that also featured athletes from Japan, Israel and Luxembourg. Furthermore, It was just 0.05 seconds behind the fastest man in the separate Team USA race, Stephen Garbet, who at the time was ranked 31st in the world. That was something worth celebrating. ‚ÄúWhen I knew he took first, that feeling inside is pretty rewarding,‚Äù Frimpong‚Äôs coach, Zach Lund, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like having a kid or something and seeing them do well. To see his joy is all I needed.‚Äù Coach is an intermittent term for Lund. A Salt Lake City native who placed fifth in skeleton in the 2010 Olympics, he coached Team USA from 2012-18. He met Ghana‚Äôs only skeleton racer ‚Äî and at the time one of only two in Africa ‚Äî in 2017 while Lund was still coaching the Americans. He immediately was inspired by Frimpong‚Äôs pluck and his plight as an athlete from a small nation with few resources. So, he agreed to be Frimpong‚Äôs full-time coach for the 2018-19 season. Then funding ran out, and Lund had to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job with the medical product company Stryker. Lund‚Äôs plan was to make a clean break from skeleton, a sport he had been tied to since he was a teenager. But he couldn‚Äôt turn his back on Frimpong. ‚ÄúHonestly I would have completely walked away from the sport I‚Äôve been in for 25 years if it hadn‚Äôt been for him,‚Äù Lund, 41, said. ‚ÄúHe keeps that passion going for me. Seeing him succeed means a lot to me.‚Äù  As a gesture of goodwill, Lund reviewed videos of Frimpong‚Äôs races when he could. When he realized he could attend the regionals, his first live race of the season, he offered to coach Frimpong for a day. (Photo courtesy of Akwasi Frimpong) Akwasi Frimpong races skeleton for Ghana. The former Utah Valley University track athlete, who still lives in Salt Lake City, won Africa's first sliding race at the Utah Olympic Park on Feb. 29, 2020. Frimpong credits Lund‚Äôs track knowledge and strict stance on body position for his success. Lund knows better, though. He said his greatest contribution that day was faith. Frimpong, a man with a big smile to match his big goals, had become downtrodden. His performances had improved slightly but, because of changes made by the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation in the way it ranks athletes and in its qualifications for the 2022 Olympics, he felt he was losing traction. He was starting to question if all the naysayers were right about his ability to become the first African athlete to medal in the Winter Olympics. He wondered if his and his family‚Äôs sacrifices were worth it. Maybe it was time to stop spending money on travel to races instead of taking his wife and daughter on vacation. Maybe he should remodel his bathroom instead of rebuilding his sled. ‚ÄúIt sounds dumb, but in a dream or something I realized he needed that person to believe in him. He didn‚Äôt need that technical stuff,‚Äù Lund said. ‚ÄúHaving someone believe in you can make all the difference in the world. My goal was to make him believe in himself again. I wasn‚Äôt going into details and data and stuff like that. My goal was making him mentally stronger. ‚ÄúHe told me, ‚ÄòWhen you started believing in me, I started believing I could actually do it and maybe I am capable of doing what I wanted to do.‚Äô‚Äù With faith came consistency. With consistency came his win in Park City. With that win came a clearer path to Beijing in 2022. (Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune) Former Utah Valley University sprinter Akwasi Frimpong carries the flag of Ghana during the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony at Olympic Stadium Friday, February 9, 2018. Frimpong finished No. 75 in the 2019-20 IBSF rankings. By late 2021, he must move into the top 60. He successfully did that in 2018 to qualify for Pyeongchang, but a few things are different this time around. For one thing, the IBSF has cut the Olympic field to 25, down from 30, which mostly cuts into the opportunities for smaller nations. For another, Africa isn‚Äôt guaranteed a representative. Those are just the obstacles to getting to the Games. Winning a medal requires breaking through a whole other set of markers. He‚Äôll likely need a new sled, a new helmet and a healed body to bring that to fruition. Frimpong won‚Äôt have to spend the offseason repairing the cracks in his self-esteem, though. Thanks to the successful end to his season, and Lund‚Äôs faith, they‚Äôve already disappeared. ‚ÄúNext season, I think I will shock myself and shock the world if I can stay focused and have the resources I need,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not there yet, but the confidence I built last season I think is going to multiply next season.‚Äù Donate to the newsroom now.

Johannesburg resident Christiaan Otto has drawn the ire of local LGBTQ activists for a series of social media posts attacking LGBTQ people, including calling homosexuality a ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù and saying Caitlyn Jenner ‚Äúis delusional and needs help.‚Äù This month, he said COVID-19 is ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs judgment on a godless world,‚Äù alongside pictures of LGBTQ Pride parades, Mambo Online reports. However, a Facebook group called ‚ÄúExpose Christian Otto‚Äù claims to have evidence of Otto‚Äôs Grindr profile, under the name RBayDiscreet, listing himself as ‚Äúbottom/vers‚Äù and seeking sex.  The group‚Äôs administrators said they were not trying to attack Otto by exposing the profile they claimed belonged to him, but instead were trying to ‚Äú[protect] vulnerable people from [him].‚Äù Additional posts included snippets of text conversations that the group claimed proved Otto was in Richards Bay ‚Äî hence the ‚ÄúRBayDiscreet‚Äù profile name ‚Äî during the time the Grindr messages were sent.  In one WhatsApp conversation, a profile allegedly belonging to Otto writes: ‚ÄúI thought I could trust you dude. You say you deleted the Grindr chats. What are you trying to do? Delete and block me!‚Äù The group shared a statement telling Otto that it was ‚Äútime you stop‚Äù and saying they ‚Äúwill continue to expose you and raise up awareness against your hate speech.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou might have a ‚ÄòGod‚Äô or ‚Äòprophet‚Äô complex, but get one thing straight, you are NOT a prophet nor some form or religious authority, you are simply a desperate individual that constantly looks for clout and fame in what ever sick way you find next,‚Äù the message reads. ‚ÄúYou think controversial opinions will get you attention, well now you have it, but I doubt in the way you want it.‚Äù Speaking to Mamba Online, Otto said that the Grindr profile was faked and an attempt to smear him, saying he ‚Äúthought Grindr was something that you cut metal with. ‚ÄúAll they are doing is creating falsehood against me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey just took old photos off of my Facebook account and they created this profile. It‚Äôs not rocket science.‚Äù He also rejected claims that his social media posts constitute hate speech, instead accusing his critics of hatred. In a subsequent video posted to his Facebook, he said, ‚ÄúI do not apologize for my Christianity or what I believe in‚Äù and accused LGBTQ people of harassing him.  While Otto denies ownership of the Grindr profile ‚Äî which was deleted after it was shared by the Facebook group ‚Äî his social media posts have led to an official complaint being submitted to South Africa‚Äôs Human Rights Commission. The Rainbow Network, an LGBTQ group comprised of members of the country‚Äôs Democratic Alliance political party, said that though they respect freedom of speech and religious liberty, they ‚Äúmust, in no uncertain terms, condemn the use of religious freedom as a defence against bigotry, discrimination and hate speech.‚Äù ‚ÄúOtto‚Äôs assertion that homosexuality is a mental illness and that those who do not conform to the gender binary must suffer from mental disorders, including a description of transgender individuals as delusional,‚Äù City of Ekurhuleni Councillor Kade Guerreiro told Mamba Online. Guerreiro added: ‚ÄúOtto‚Äôs remarks are shamelessly inflammatory and homophobic, and are particularly dangerous at a time when, in addition to the monumental battle against discrimination and social abuse, the LGBTIQ community stands with the rest of our country, as we face a distressing and uncertain battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.‚Äù In response to the human rights complaint, Otto told Mamba Online that he is a ‚ÄúGod-fearing‚Äù Christian. ‚ÄúI do not force my beliefs down any persons‚Äô throats, but I do have the religious freedom to share mine just as the LGBTQ movement have the right to share theirs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have their own truth and I have mine, but we should respect each other in both of our truths.‚Äù Read more: Turkey‚Äôs president defends religious leader who said homosexuality ‚Äúbrings illnesses‚Äù Folsom Street Fair and Up Your Alley festivals to be held virtually in 2020 Trump administration poised to rewrite Obamacare, without LGBTQ protections  By John Riley on March 23, 2022 @JohnAndresRiley Mayor Eric Adams has removed a Staten Island pastor, who once equated homosexuality with pedophilia, from a key educational post, less than six hours after announcing her appointment. On Tuesday, Adams announced Rev. Kathlyn Barrett-Layne, the head of Reach Out and Touch Ministries in Staten Island, as one of his nine picks to the Panel for Educational Policy, which serves as a governing body for the city Department of Education and approves its contracts. In a press release, Adams' office described Barrett-Layne as a seasoned minister who ""spends her time inspiring people with her speaking and teaching in Bible studies."" By John Riley on March 24, 2022 @JohnAndresRiley An influential police union leader from Miami was suspended last month following an incident in Tallahassee involving a man he met on the gay dating app Grindr. A January 11 report from the Tallahassee Police Department reveals that Miami Police Department Sgt. Tommy Reyes, the openly gay president of Miami's Fraternal Order of Police union, was nearly charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for pulling a gun on his one-night stand after the man stole his wallet during their liaison and attempted to blackmail him, according to the Miami New Times. Reyes, 36, who has, since 2018, led Miami's local FOP chapter -- which negotiates police contracts with the City of Miami on behalf of the union's members -- informed his union that he was suspended. By John Riley on March 29, 2022 @JohnAndresRiley Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene attacked Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and his husband during a homophobic and transphobic screed at a Donald Trump rally in Commerce, Ga., last Saturday. ""You know what? Pete Buttigieg can take his electric vehicles and his bicycles, and he and his husband can stay out of our girl's bathrooms,"" Greene said. Greene appeared to be referencing ongoing debates over which public restrooms transgender people should use. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, are gay, not transgender. But whether Greene has conflated gay and transgender people into the same category of people she despises, or whether she knows the difference and was just pandering with anti-LGBTQ buzzwords to the crowd of rally-goers, the Trump devotees in attendance were all too happy to feast on the ""red meat"" she tossed out, greeting her comments with cheers, according to Business Insider.

Hours later, Biden expressed regret for the remarks, calling them ""really unfortunate"" and saying he ""shouldn't have been such a wise guy."" ""I shouldn't have been so cavalier in responding,"" he said during a phone call with the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce Friday afternoon. ""No one should have to vote for any party, based on their race or religion or background,"" Biden said. At another point on the call, Biden admitted, ""I know that the comments have come off like I was taking the African American folks for granted ... but nothing could be further from the truth."" ""I've never ever done that, and I've earned it every time I've run. I was making the point that I have never taken a vote for granted,"" he said. Tensions had erupted from the beginning of Biden's interview with Charlamagne tha God, when the apparent Democratic nominee told the radio host he knew Charlamagne had been critical of his candidacy in the past. ""You don't know me,"" Biden said. Following questions about why Biden had shown ""so much resistance"" to admitting how his 1994 crime bill had led to a spike in black incarceration, the former vice president grew frustrated after it was suggested that he had done more harm than good to the African American community. The interview, which was taped Thursday and broadcast Friday, was halted by a campaign staffer after the radio host asked Biden whether he would commit to choosing a black running mate in reward for the strong support African Americans had given him throughout his career. ""You can't do that to black media,‚Äù Charlamagne said. ""I can do that to white media, black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o‚Äôclock,"" Biden responded, referring to a virtual event Dr. Jill Biden had to attend. Then, noting that the radio host had more questions, Biden proceeded to make his ""you ain‚Äôt black"" remark. Biden has said he plans to pick a woman as his running mate, but has not said she would have to be black. He has committed to nominating an African American woman to the Supreme Court. A Biden senior adviser tweeted that the candidate's remark was made ""in jest."" The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let‚Äôs be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump‚Äôs any day. Period. Biden has often been defensive of his criminal justice record, which has been a subject of scrutiny since he began his presidential campaign over a year ago, in large part due to his spearheading of the 1994 crime bill when he served as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. However, the repeated attacks on his record, including by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at the first Democratic debate, did not stop him from earning the overwhelming support of the black community in the South Carolina primary, propelling him to become the apparent Democratic nominee. Biden made that point during the interview when asked if he could attract enough African American and Hispanic youth voters to win the election. ""Remember when they said ‚ÄòBiden can't win the primaries?‚Äô I kicked everybody's ahh ... ,"" he said, his voice trailing off. ""I won overwhelmingly."" The former vice president stressed he will win the African American vote and is committed to reforming the crime bill by implementing his plan to reduce the number of inmates and decriminalizing marijuana. Charlamagne told Biden that his skepticism about Biden's criminal justice record has ""nothing to do with Trump,"" but everything to do with his personal urge to help his community overcome deep racial disparities. ""Take a look at my record, man,"" Biden said. ""I extended the Voting Rights Act 25 years. I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP has endorsed me every time I've run. I mean, come on, take a look at the record."" The Trump campaign's Katrina Pierson called Biden's remarks ""racist and dehumanizing,"" saying, ""Joe Biden believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking."" On a call with reporters hosted by the Trump campaign, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the GOP's sole African American senator, said he was ""shocked and surprised"" when he heard Biden's ""you ain't black"" comment, calling it ""negative, race-baiting rhetoric."" ""I was struck by the condescension and the arrogance in his comments,"" Scott said. ""I could not believe my ears that he would stoop so low to tell folks what they should do, how they should think and what it means to be black.""

The statue symbolizes the triumph of African liberation from centuries of ignorance, intolerance and racism, and he hopes it will rival the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower in Paris as a tourist destination. Renaissance Monument in West Africa ‚Äì Senegal is a colossal structure of bronze at a height of 49 meters which is approximately 160 feet. Mighty Renaissance Monument is located on the of of twin hills in Mamelles a district in Dakar Senegal. Overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The monument illustrates a man with a bare, ripped chest carrying a baby high in one arm and leading a woman with the other. In the monument, the baby looks forward to a bright future, while the woman reaches out her arm to remember the traumatic past. Her hair is whipped back by the air, as are her scant, tattered cloth-like garments.  The statue was designed by Senegalese architect named Pierre Goudiaby this was after the idea was brought up by President Abdoulaye Wade and it was built by North Korean company Mansudae Overseas Project. The planning of the place on the peak of the 100-meter-high hill started in 2006 and the building of the bronze statue commenced in 2008. Initially expected to be completed in December 2009 but reached up to early 2010.

Gyan completed a shocking loan move to United Arab Emirates side Al-Ain during the 2011/12 campaign from English side Sunderland. The now 34-year-old became a household name in the Gulf region after his competition-high 22 goals fired the side to Pro League title, and also bagged a further one goal in the Asian Champions League. After his making the deal permanent the following season, Gyan went on to score a total of 73 goals including 17 goals in the Asian Champions League during his three years stay with the club. He spent two unsuccessful seasons with Chinese Super League outfit Shanghai SIPG before returning to the Emirati Championship to join Al Ahli Dubai on a season-long loan. The Ghana striker scored 2 goals in the Asian Champions League with the club but ended the campaign with a total of 8 goals in 14 matches before leaving to sign for Turkish club Kayserispor in 2017. He returned to Asia to sign for Indian Super League club NorthEast United FC on a one-year deal. The club however released him after just three months into his contract due to his long battle with injuries. It has appeared that the Ghana international is still sitting atop as the African with most goals in the continent's top-tier inter-club competition with 20 goals.

"195",3762,"https://businesstech.co.za/news/trending/395370/south-african-breweries-calls-for-the-sale-of-beer-and-other-alcohol-under-these-conditions/","South African Breweries calls for the sale of beer and other alcohol under these conditions","BusinessTech South Africa stands out as a worldwide anomaly by adopting a national ban on alcohol sales as a unique measure to combat the spread of Covid-19 and ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù. As history has taught us, banning of alcohol sales and distribution has unintended consequences, such as an increase in illicit liquor trades, says Hellen Ndlovu, director of regulatory & public policy at South African Breweries (SAB). There is a fear that if we don‚Äôt learn from the USA prohibition of alcohol (1919 ‚Äì 1933), these consequences may grow exponentially as the ban remains in place. The sale and production of alcohol was prohibited in the United States between 1919 and 1933 ‚Äì a historical event commonly known as ‚ÄúThe Prohibition‚Äù. The US government thought this would discourage people from consuming alcohol, but they were very wrong. What prohibition did do, was allow crime syndicates producing or smuggling booze to flourish, Ndlovu said. South Africa is currently operating under level 4 lockdown regulations, which bans the sale and distribution of alcohol. That will change once the regulations are relaxed to level 3. ‚ÄúThe lessons learned from the US Prohibition are eerily relevant when we unpack the unintended consequences the ban on alcohol distribution and sales have had in our country over the last 5 weeks,‚Äù Ndlovu said. There is a fear that these consequences may grow exponentially as the ban remains in place if we don‚Äôt learn from the prohibition of alcohol in the US. Lessons learned: Lesson 1 ‚Äì Prohibition puts markets into the hands of criminals Banning alcohol sales doesn‚Äôt suddenly remove demand. Banning alcohol simply hands the market to criminals. ‚ÄúSouth Africa already has a fully functional illegal alcohol market. This illicit liquor trades over R13 billion a year and results in annual tax losses in excess of R6 billion. ‚ÄúAs has been widely reported, the ban has offered criminals an unparalleled opportunity to grow their illicit activities which will undoubtedly result in growing losses to both government and the legal alcohol sector,‚Äù Ndlovu said. Lesson 2 ‚Äì Prohibition changes people‚Äôs behaviour By banning the legal sale of alcohol, ordinary law abiding citizens become criminals overnight and it changes how they consume alcohol, she said. In the US, consumers switched to more potent drinks and illegal producers ‚Äì Bootleggers ‚Äì were incentivised to produce hard liquor rather than beer and wine. During Prohibition, the death rate from acute alcohol poisoning (due to overdose) was more than 30 times higher than it is today. ‚ÄúIn South Africa, spirits accounts for the largest share of illicit alcohol volumes, resulting from counterfeiting and substitution/refill activities. Illicit industrial manufacturing is mostly run by very sophisticated, organised criminal cartels concentrating on high-margin products,‚Äù Ndlovu said. As South Africans change their drinking behaviour and demand increases for access to more potent alcohol, already existing illicit producers will seize this opportunity to grow their businesses and create a stronghold in the market. ‚ÄúAnother risk is the influx of a host of new illicit producers looking to make a quick buck, thereby introducing potentially hazardous substances which could endanger thousands of desperate consumers who normally wouldn‚Äôt have taken the risk of purchasing illicit alcohol,‚Äù she warned. Lesson 3 ‚Äì Prohibition diverts law enforcement resources A law that few people agree with requires massive enforcement if government wants it to succeed, said Ndlovu. In the first weeks of the lockdown, South African citizens generally accepted the ban of alcohol sales in light of the initial high levels of uncertainty and turmoil. As time passed, the acceptance and understanding of the purpose of a prolonged ban on alcohol, however faded fast. ‚ÄúIn South Africa, the growing illegal sales of all types of alcohol at exorbitant prices and the spike in looting of alcohol stores and storage facilities has been widely reported. ‚ÄúAn already strained and exhausted police force is now tasked to deal with additional problems, while the resulting legal battles to deal with these cases will further burden an already overloaded legal system,‚Äù said Ndlovu. Lesson 4 ‚Äì Prohibition almost never works Despite the effort, prohibition failed to end alcohol consumption in the US. ‚ÄúIn fact, as we have seen from our own experience during our indefinite lockdown, telling someone they can‚Äôt have something, makes them want it even more. The question that requires careful consideration is however, at what cost will people pursue the forbidden fruit?‚Äù Where to from here? The regulatory position taken towards alcohol in South Africa has definitely been on the extreme end of the spectrum when compared to lockdown measures put in place by other countries ‚Äì both on the continent and globally, said SAB. In some countries where bans were instituted the governments quickly reversed them when it became clear that the unintended consequences were worse than the initial perceived threats. Naturally these consequences included spikes in illicit alcohol trade and deaths related to the consumption of unsafe illicit substances, Ndlovu said. ‚ÄúIf not addressed soon, the alarming rise in illicit trade, health emergencies and criminal incidents involving alcohol will become a crisis in its own right in South Africa. ‚ÄúBy implementing measured concessions now, our government can prevent this matter from becoming an ongoing drain on precious government time and resources in a time where the attention is much more needed elsewhere,‚Äù she said. SAB called for a more measured approach to the sale of alcohol, including limiting the amount of alcohol that can be purchased, introducing online sales, trading hour restrictions for stores selling for personal consumption, and opening up sales of lower alcohol by volume (ABV) products only. Sell beer to save jobs The Beer Association of South Africa (BASA) representing the Craft Brewers Association, Heineken and South African Breweries recently called for the ‚Äòoff-consumption‚Äô beer trade to resume. The association made a number of submissions to president Cyril Ramaphosa with proposals as to how to ensure the survival of the industry. Some of these include: ‚ÄúWe believe our proposal balances both the need to mitigate health risks and preserving the stability of the legal beer industry and our business,‚Äù BASA said. ‚ÄúAs an association, we have made a commitment to work with SAPS and other law enforcement agencies to take swift action against any traders who do not comply with the regulations,‚Äù it said.

WHO African Region made this known via its Twitter handle on Tuesday. The health organisation said an agreement was reached with the herbal medicine experts on clinical trials of their remedies.  The PUNCH reports that the meeting is coming days after Madagascar said it found an herbal remedy capable of curing the disease. @WHOAFRO tweeted, ‚Äú70 traditional medicine experts from countries across #Africa held a virtual meeting with @WHO on the role of traditional medicine in the #COVID19 response. ‚ÄúThey unanimously agreed that clinical trials must be conducted for all medicines in the Region, without exception.‚Äù Earlier, Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina criticised WHO and other international organisations for allegedly scorning local ‚Äúremedy‚Äù for COVID-19. ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt Madagascar, and if it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt?

In a call with the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce that was added to his public schedule, Biden said he would never ‚Äútake the African American community for granted.‚Äù ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have been such a wise guy,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúNo one should have to vote for any party based on their race or religion or background.‚Äù That was an acknowledgement of the stinging criticism he received in response to his comments, which he made earlier in the day on ‚ÄúThe Breakfast Club,‚Äù a radio program that is popular in the black community. The rebukes included allies of Trump‚Äôs reelection campaign ‚Äî anxious to go on the offense after weeks of defending the Republican president‚Äôs response to the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äî and some activists who warned that Biden must still court black voters, even if African Americans overwhelmingly oppose the president. ‚ÄúNone of us can afford for the party or for this campaign to mess this election up, and comments like these are the kinds that frankly either make black voters feel like we‚Äôre not really valued and people don‚Äôt care if we show up or not,‚Äù said Alicia Garza, a Black Lives Matter co-founder and principal of Black Futures Lab. Near the end of Biden‚Äôs appearance on the radio program, host Charlamagne Tha God pressed him on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be his vice presidential running mate. The host told Biden that black voters ‚Äúsaved your political life in the primaries‚Äù and ‚Äúhave things they want from you.‚Äù Biden said that ‚ÄúI guarantee you there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple.‚Äù A Biden aide then sought to end the interview, prompting the host to say, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that to black media.‚Äù Biden responded, ‚ÄúI do that to black media and white media,‚Äù and said his wife needed to use the television studio. He then added: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a problem figuring out whether you‚Äôre for me or for Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs campaign and his allies immediately seized on Biden‚Äôs comments. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Trump supporter and the Senate‚Äôs sole black Republican, said he was ‚Äúshocked and surprised‚Äù by Biden‚Äôs remarks. ‚ÄúI was struck by the condescension and the arrogance in his comments,‚Äù Scott said in a conference call arranged by the Trump campaign. ‚ÄúI could not believe my ears that he would stoop so low to tell folks what they should do, how they should think and what it means to be black.‚Äù Charlamagne Tha God later said on CNN, ‚ÄúA black woman running mate is necessary, especially after today.‚Äù He added that the question of ‚Äúwhat makes somebody black‚Äù is a discussion for black people, not for ‚Äúa white man.‚Äù Trump himself has a history of incendiary rhetoric related to race. When he launched his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump called many Mexican immigrants ‚Äúrapists.‚Äù Campaigning in 2016, he asked black voters, ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you have to lose?‚Äù In 2017, he said there are good people on ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of the clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racist demonstrators that left one counterprotester dead. In 2018, during a private White House meeting on immigration, Trump wondered why the United States was admitting so many immigrants from ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù like African nations. He also blasted four Democratic congresswomen of color, saying they hate America and should ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to where they come from, even though all are U.S. citizens and three were born in the U.S. Black voters helped resurrect Biden‚Äôs campaign in this year‚Äôs primaries with a second-place finish in the Nevada caucuses and a resounding win in the South Carolina primary after he‚Äôd started with embarrassing finishes in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire. Sixty-one percent of black voters supported Biden during the primary season, according to AP VoteCast surveys across 17 states that voted in February and March. Biden is now seeking to maintain his standing with black voters while building the type of multiracial and multigenerational coalition that twice elected Barack Obama, whom he served as vice president. He has already committed to picking a woman as his running mate and is considering several African American contenders who could energize black voters. But Biden is also considering candidates such as Klobuchar, who could appeal to white moderates. There is little chance of a sudden shift in support for Trump among black voters. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, compared with 84% who view him unfavorably. Seventy-five percent of African American registered voters say they have a favorable view of Biden; 21% hold an unfavorable opinion. There is a risk, however, of black voters, especially those who are younger, staying home in November, which could complicate Biden‚Äôs path to victory in a tight election. The Breakfast Club is a particularly notable venue for Biden‚Äôs comments because the program is popular among younger African Americans. Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a national organization that works to mobilize black voters, said many black Americans are loyal Biden supporters. But she said his comments make it harder to attract people who are on the fence about voting. ‚ÄúThe first thing I thought about was to what degree did this just turn off those voters and how much more work the rest of us are going to have to do to convince people that it is worth their time and their efforts,‚Äù she said. Biden‚Äôs selection of a running mate, along with his pledge to appoint the first black female Supreme Court justice, could help motivate voters. He‚Äôs begun vetting vice presidential contenders, a process he‚Äôs said will likely last through July. Several black women are among those under consideration, including California Sen.

The first antidepressant drug, an MOAI inhibitor, was developed in the 1950‚Äôs and originally used in the treatment of tuberculosis. In the 19080‚Äôs, the first SSRI inhibitor was developed, and today there are now 5 classes of antidepressants, which includes at least 32 different brand name drugs.  More Americans than ever take antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, and according to a recent study, some 86% of people today will have met the criteria for at least two psychiatric diagnoses by the time they reach 45. More drugs, more diagnoses, and more people dependent on doctors, pharmacies and pills. Something is not working. Contrast this paradigm with traditional shamanism, in which shamans, working as healers, use plant medicines to diagnose the spiritual health of a person, and heal them permanently with ancient methods that still baffle modern science. Of the shamanic plant medicines, iboga is particularly powerful at helping people to overcome PTSD, depression and anxiety. Its efficacy cannot be explained in scientific terms, which reduces chronic emotional and mental health issues down to brain chemistry, looking at the human being as a machine, then intervenes with chemicals. This is categorically different than the work of shamanism, which generally views such mental health conditions as spiritual matters, and seeks to repair a person‚Äôs spirit from within. Traditional African shaman Moughenda Mikala points out in a recent interview, pills simply cannot address the root causes of such problems. ‚ÄúWhen we are talking about trauma, depression, and PTSD, they are not physical. Now days people need to think further‚Ä¶ to understand that anything that is not physical is difficult‚Ä¶ someone has to know where to look.‚Äù ~Moughenda Mikala, Bwiti Life As a 10th generation Bwiti shaman working with an ancient plant medicine, Mikala uses traditional shamanic methods to assess and heal people on a spiritual level, which addresses the roots of mental health problems rather than attempting only to manage the symptoms of such disorders. ‚ÄúThe way I handle these issues, or with my guests coming to me, I don‚Äôt focus on the physical level, because trauma‚Ä¶ mainly affects the mind, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about, the mind being a spiritual issue. So, the way I address that, I will launch someone on a psycho-spiritual journey‚Ä¶ and before the spycho-spiritual journey, I will launch them on a psycho-detox.‚Äù Mikala is referring to ceremonies, in which participants ingest the alkaloid rich root bark of the iboga shrub, which triggers a body trance and sets off an inward psychological journey. The psycho-detox is very common with first-time Western participants, and typically causes the participant to enter a foggy, trance-like state for hours where they begin to see from within the workings of their mind, including thought patterns and belief systems. The psycho-spiritual journey Mikala mentions is a second experience with iboga, in which after detoxifying the mind in a first ceremony, the participant typically is launched into a surreal journey into the subconscious mind and is able to clearly review one‚Äôs life and make a direct, impressionable connection to their own soul. (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:13792210441443686,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-9661-1728""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdomecdn.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs""); It is this experience which Mikala says heals the wounds that cause depression, anxiety and PTSD. He notes: ‚ÄúThe psycho-detox is kind of addressing the mind, and to detox the mind that means we reach a level to empty all of this trauma‚Ä¶ it could be stress or any other forced beliefs‚Ä¶ the garbage. And then, we have to take that person back to the very first day when that trauma started. It‚Äôs what I call a life-review‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt just do that from the mind, you have to actually go there live to the first day where everything started. It could be a rape‚Ä¶ and a lot of women are still suffering from it. And the problem is they‚Äôve been running from the pain, the fear, the everything.‚Äù ~ Moughenda Mikala Because the trauma that leads to PTSD and depression lives within the mind, potentially for one‚Äôs entire life, the images and memories of traumatic experiences, like combat, are revisited over and again by the mind. Pharmaceutical pills only cover up these images, causing people to lose everything, including joy and possibly life itself. ‚ÄúSo healing someone from trauma, PTSD or depression, there‚Äôs only one way. That is the traditional way. We have the best way to heal the mind. No pills. Pills won‚Äôt heal any mind, I don‚Äôt care how many years you‚Äôre going to be taking those pills, they won‚Äôt heal you, because not a single pill will be able to take you to a spiritual trip where you meet your soul face-to-face and have a long conversation with it.‚Äù ~Moughenda Mikala Mikala further explains that this experience helps people to recognize what it is that caused their trauma and allows them to look at it up close and accept it as part of their lives, and then move on. Having personally experienced this, and personally knowing Moughenda, I can say that the experience of iboga, when conducted ceremonially with properly trained healers and facilitators, is exceptionally extraordinary and leaves a lasting impression which, over time, continues to positively influence mental and spiritual health. http://youtu.be/NqnSRaE6q8o  Dylan Charles is the editor of Waking Times and host of Battered Souls: A Podcast About Transformation, both dedicated to ideas of personal transformation, societal awakening, and planetary renewal.

Maya Santamaria, former owner of El Nuevo Rodeo club in Minneapolis, Minn., told the Twin Cities Pioneer Press that Floyd and Chauvin both worked at the club together but she is unclear if the two men knew each other. She also noted that ‚Äúwhen the club hosted events that drew a mainly black clientele,‚Äù Chauvin responded to fights by taking out his mace and spraying the crowd, a tactic she told him was unjustified ‚Äòoverkill.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúHe would mace everyone instead of apprehending the people who were fighting,‚Äù Santamaria told the Pioneer Press. ‚ÄúHe would call backup. The next thing you would know, there would be five or six squad cars.‚Äù On May 25, Floyd was stopped, forced to the ground and placed in handcuffs by Chauvin, who was subsequently was recorded on video kneeling on Floyd‚Äôs neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd can be heard yelling ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù several times on the video. Floyd was eventually rendered unconscious and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Officials fired Officer Chauvin from the police force Tuesday, along with three other officers who were also present during the arrest and did nothing to stop the excessive use of force. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Like many police officers, Chauvin had an off-duty job working security and maintained his off-duty brutality hustle for 17 years until his arrest. The Pioneer Press notes that Floyd ‚Äústarted working there recently as a bouncer but only worked about a dozen events put on by ‚ÄòAfrican American promoters.‚Äô‚Äù Get 26% off and Spend 100% Less Time Cleaning Equipped with its own self-empty station, this vacuum connects to Alexa devices and allows you to create maps of your rooms, so you can be completely hands-off. Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said that if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, ‚Äúhe might have given him a little more mercy.‚Äù She did add that Chauvin appeared to work well during Latino events but would be overly aggressive during ‚ÄúAfrican American‚Äù nights. ‚ÄúI told him I thought this is unnecessary to be pepper-sprayed. The knee-jerk reaction of being afraid, it seemed like overkill,‚Äù Santamaria said. ‚ÄúIt was a concern and I did voice my opinion, but police officers have a way of justifying what they do.‚Äù She added that she was shocked to see the video of Chauvin with his knee pressed against Floyd‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúI thought he would have more of a conscience,‚Äù she told the Pioneer Press. ‚ÄúEven if he is a bit of racist, he‚Äôs a human being‚Ä¶ At what point does your humanity overpower your racial bias?‚Äù Apparently, never, Ms. Santamaria.

By Kimberly Mutandiro Musa has six siblings and they all live with their elderly grandparents. They hardly ever have enough food to eat at home. They used to eat at school through the school feeding scheme. Now with the Covid-19 lockdown, they get up at 6am and start delivering cigarettes to their regular customers around the township. They buy a packet of cigarettes for R53 and sell loose cigarettes for R5 each, netting a profit of R47 a pack. More expensive brands, they sell for R10 a cigarette. Musa gets cigarettes from older boys on the streets. He recruited Thato to help. At first they were mugged by nyaope smokers, they say, but now they are more vigilant. ‚ÄúSelling cigarettes helps buy food for my family,‚Äù says Musa. A few days ago with the profit of R75 he made from selling cigarettes, he managed to buy 12.5kg of mielie meal. Now he wants to buy a 2kg braai pack of chicken. Thato lives with four siblings and his parents, who are unemployed. Two days ago, he bought cooking oil for the household with the proceeds from his illegal cigarette trade. Musa and Thato are not alone. GroundUp spoke to more than ten children selling cigarettes. Older unemployed youths are running the ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù side of the black market, getting stock from as far as Johannesburg. A 16-year-old grade 9 student, Bafana*, says he sells three to four cartons of loose cigarettes a day. He and his three siblings live with their mother. He used to help his unemployed mom by doing piecemeal work, offloading goods trucks at the local mall, but that has stopped since lockdown. Pantso*, 14, and Mpho*, 16, have also teamed up to sell cigarettes. ‚ÄúMy mom doesn‚Äôt have to worry about buying tomatoes and onions now; it is now my expense,‚Äù says Pantso. But, he says, he cannot wait for schools to reopen. Mandisa*, 15, is selling snuff tobacco. He gets snuff for R15 and sells it at R20. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm selling 20 to 30 pieces a day. It‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù he says. John*, 18, said, ‚ÄúI know that selling cigarettes is illegal at the moment. But l have raised a lot of money so far and it is my ticket out of the township.‚Äù Some people in the township expressed concern about the trade conducted by children on the streets. Resident Colleen Mhlanga disapproves. ‚ÄúAt this pace, children will end up selling anything, even drugs, to help look after themselves and their families,‚Äù she says. * Not their real names Published originally on GroundUp / ¬© 2020 GroundUp.

A 30-year-old woman was arrested at the scene and, as of this writing, is being held under the Mental Health Act. Jones was not beheaded. Police described the person arrested as a 30-year-old woman with a history of mental problems. Claims that this person was a Somali migrant are based on unfounded speculation. On March 22, 2020, a young girl named Emily Jones was killed by a stranger while playing in a park in England. BBC News reported at the time: Bolton stabbing: Girl, seven, killed by stranger in park A seven-year-old girl has died after being stabbed by a stranger in a park. The girl suffered serious injuries in the attack at Queen‚Äôs Park in Bolton at about 14:30 GMT, Greater Manchester Police said. A force spokesman said despite the ‚Äúbest efforts of her family and medical responders, she died a short while later‚Äù. A 30-year-old woman, who was not known to the family, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder. Initial reports about Jones‚Äô death did not identify the woman who was arrested. With this information unknown, some social media users attempted to fill in the blanks by claiming, without evidence, that Jones had been killed by a Somali migrant. When the local news outlet Manchester Evening News reported that Jones had suffered a serious stab wound to her neck, this gruesome detail soon morphed into the false claim that this little girl was beheaded. By May 2020, a meme containing a photograph of Jones and a piece of text claiming that she had been ‚Äúbeheaded‚Äù by a Somali migrant was circulating on social media:  A 7-year-old named Emily Jones was truly killed by a stranger in a park in England. She was not beheaded, as claimed in this meme, and police did not identify her killer as a Somali migrant. This claim is based on little more than speculation and is being spread by neo-Nazi websites such as The National Vanguard. Although police have not released the identity of the woman arrested, they did say that the approximately 30-year-old woman had a history of mental illness. As of this writing, she is being held at a secure facility under the Mental Health Act. BBC News reported: A 30-year-old woman, who was not known to the family, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said officers were ‚Äúworking to understand the motive for this completely random and brutal attack‚Äù. ‚ÄúA woman who was not known to the family was detained by a member of the public and then arrested by the police,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe understand that the woman has some history of mental illness and we are working to understand if this played any part in her motive.‚Äù The Facebook page for the Greater Manchester Police force posted a tribute from Jones‚Äô family:  McDonnell, Seamus; Oldfield, Paige. ‚ÄúThis is Emily, 7, Who Was Stabbed to Death in a Bolton Park.

Rhinos across Africa are being poached at an increasingly high rate amid COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions. With national parks and wildlife reserves currently free of tourists and patrols, poachers are taking advantage of stay-at-home orders. They are killing and injuring rhinos and other endangered species in tourist hotspots and other places that are usually safe due to the normally large influx of tourists. Poachers hunt rhinos for their horns and bushmeat, which they illegally trade in exchange for money. Several poaching bosses have instructed their employees to hunt rhinos in parks and other typically protected spaces since COVID-19 restrictions have gone into effect, according to a report from the Wildlife Justice Commission published in April. In the last few months, six rhinos have been killed by poachers in Botswana and another nine have been poached in South Africa. Kenya has also seen a recent increase in poaching. As the pandemic halts tourism to Africa, poachers are killing rhinos in travel hot spots now devoid of visitors. In Botswana, at least 6 $rhinos have been poached since the virus shut down tourism there and in the northwest South Africa, at least nine. https://t.co/L7Zh5IvkZlpic.twitter.com/hLRO4aKeaR Due to COVID-19 restrictions and the overall lack of tourism revenue, ranger patrols have been significantly reduced. Many rangers have been forced to stay home, while others have taken substantial pay cuts. The pandemic has also caused a drastic dip in funding for the protection of wildlife reserves and endangered species. ""The COVID-19 lockdown illustrates just how important ecotourism is for the conservation of Africa‚Äôs natural heritage,"" WildAid CEO Peter Knights told HuffPost.

(May 5, 2020) ‚Äî Sydney Sayre appreciates the history she‚Äôs making in May as she graduates as the University of Kentucky's first African American and Africana Studies (AAAS) major in the College of Arts and Sciences. ‚ÄúThe first black studies course took place at UK in 1969, and in 2020 I‚Äôll be the first person to graduate as a major in African American and Africana studies,‚Äù said Sayre, who grew up on a horse farm and considers Lexington her hometown. ‚ÄúI think history is all about new beginnings and change and that is what this program is doing at UK ‚Äî making history.‚Äù African American and Africana studies was available as a minor until 2019, when it became a major. Sayre, who is double majoring in history as well, accumulated enough credits to be the first student to earn the full major. ‚ÄúI was delighted to find out that, even though Sydney was already a senior when the major came online, she was able to switch to the major,‚Äù said Anastasia Curwood, director of AAAS and associate professor of history. ‚ÄúShe is dedicated to the field and has worked hard to complete the major in time for graduation.‚Äù Growing up in Kentucky, Sayre said her parents took her to many places of historical interest, particularly Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C. Sayre then studied history in an AP class at Bourbon County High School. Once she started at UK, however, she found that the story of African Americans in the United States ran much deeper than survey courses could portray. ‚ÄúMy earlier classes never really touched on painful subjects; they were something they always glossed over,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut when I came to UK, I found such a different attitude about what history was and what could be done about it now. I took Dr. Curwood‚Äôs survey class of African American history from the Civil War to the present day, and I found out so much that I didn‚Äôt know. There was a lot more to learn, and it really got me interested.‚Äù Classes taught by Curwood and Vanessa Holden, assistant professor of African American and Africana studies, provided even more incentive for Sayre to pursue this discipline. ‚ÄúI took a course with Dr. Holden on slave resistance and rebellion that changed the way I thought about American history and what I was interested in researching,‚Äù Sayre said. ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs such a painful history to learn, it allows me to recognize its effects in the present day.‚Äù As part of her major, Sayre conducted a capstone research project on how enslaved people migrated along with their slave owners across the Appalachian Mountains and settled in Kentucky in the late 18th century. The people in the forced migration from Virginia helped build some of the earliest infrastructure in the Commonwealth. ‚ÄúOne of the things I was able to do was find out how much enslaved people‚Äôs labor went into the horse industry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the families that (brought enslaved people) from Virginia to Kentucky actually was a family that later on started Keeneland. When I happened to stumble on the documents, it was a real eye-opener.‚Äù Sayre was accepted to the graduate program in the history department at UK. She thanks her parents, Julie and Luis Martinez, for their support. ‚ÄúThe faculty in history and AAAS are very proud of Sydney‚Äôs pioneering double major,‚Äù Curwood said. ‚ÄúShe has a keen sense of historical curiosity and it‚Äôs been a pleasure to watch her grow as a scholar. We look forward to the contributions she is sure to make in whatever field she chooses.‚Äù The University of Kentucky is increasingly the first choice for students, faculty and staff to pursue their passions and their professional goals. In the last two years, Forbes has named UK among the best employers for diversity, and INSIGHT into Diversity recognized us as a Diversity Champion four years running. UK is ranked among the top 30 campuses in the nation for LGBTQ* inclusion and safety. UK has been judged a ‚ÄúGreat College to Work for"" three years in a row, and UK is among only 22 universities in the country on Forbes' list of ""America's Best Employers."" We are ranked among the top 10 percent of public institutions for research expenditures ‚Äî a tangible symbol of our breadth and depth as a university focused on discovery that changes lives and communities. And our patients know and appreciate the fact that UK HealthCare has been named the state‚Äôs top hospital for five straight years. Accolades and honors are great. But they are more important for what they represent: the idea that creating a community of belonging and commitment to excellence is how we honor our mission to be not simply the University of Kentucky, but the University for Kentucky.","none","none",0,0,1,3

His ex-wife will now reportedly be investigated for insurance fraud after she was said to have claimed a six-figure cash amount following his death four years ago. The story takes a dark turn after it has emerged that the 33-year-old tried alerting authorities at the German embassy in Kinshasa that he was not dead. Kamba reported he had been separated from his group of friends during a trip in his native country, and was left without any documents, money or a cellphone. Click through the gallery below to see 10 of the most bizarre clauses some of the biggest names in football have had in their contracts!  Following his so-called disappearance, which police now believe may have been planned by his ex-wife, Kamba was pronounced dead on 9 January 2016, and it is said that the former Schalke academy product will now be considered as a witness in the trial against his former partner, with whom he has a 10-year-old son. Benni: What Mourinho Told Me When He Got Porto Job The news that Kamba, once a teammate of Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in Schalke's youth teams, is alive will surprise many who mourned his death, with the report stating that the ex-footballer is living in a house in Germany, awaiting a decision on the investigation.

"218",4323,"https://redstate.com/christopher-arps/2020/05/05/831128-n136287","Biden Campaign Teases African American Female Running Mate, Then Walks It Back","I posted on my Facebook page last week that an African American woman was probably not going to be Joe Biden‚Äôs vice-presidential pick. Biden‚Äôs campaign trotted out African American South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn (who literally saved his sagging campaign) to send up a trial balloon suggesting an African American female running mate was ‚Äúnot a must.‚Äù On April 29th Clyburn said: ‚ÄúI think having a woman on the ticket is a must. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm among those who feel that it would be great for him to select a woman of color. But that is not a must. ‚ÄúI think that he should be informed in this decision by the vetting and the polling. And I think he should be guided by his head and his heart.‚Äù But, back on March 11, Clyburn was singing an entirely different tune: ‚ÄúI really believe that we‚Äôve reached a point in this country where African American women need to be rewarded for the loyalty that they‚Äôve given to this party.‚Äù A new CBS poll shows the leading contender for Biden‚Äôs VP is Massachusetts Senator and former Biden presidential rival Elizabeth Warren. Seventy-one percent of Democratic voters say Warren should be considered as a running mate, topping the list of potential female picks. Warren was followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) at 59 percent, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abrams at 50 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) at 49 percent. The Massachusetts progressive also earned the top first-choice pick for the position, at 36 percent. Harris followed at 19 percent, ahead of Abrams at 14 percent and Klobuchar at 13 percent. Honestly, even before this poll, my money was already on Elizabeth ‚ÄúFauxcahontas‚Äù ‚ÄúLie-Awatha‚Äù ‚Äú I have a plan for that‚Äù Warren. Why do I call Senator Warren ‚ÄúLie-Awatha?‚Äù Well, she claimed to be a Native American to gain a teaching job at Harvard. She claimed her children went to public schools when they didn‚Äôt. She claimed she was fired for being pregnant even though we later learned she was offered a contract to teach for another year. She also claimed her father had been a ‚Äújanitor.‚Äù And last but not least, she claimed Bernie Sanders told her personally that a woman couldn‚Äôt be elected president of the United States. Why Senator Warren over Senators‚Äô Klobuchar, Harris, and failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abrams? I think it simply comes down to three things. One, Warren has the most appeal to Bernie Sanders voters. Sanders and Warren were both competing for the same far left-wing progressive voters during the primary season. Two, 12% of Sander‚Äôs supporters voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and recent polling says 15% will not vote for Biden this presidential election cycle. Three, she has the utter disdain and contempt for the President that the Progressives love and they feel she‚Äôs the strongest VP candidate to be the attack dog against the President ‚Äî the traditional role of the running mate. The Biden Campaign is literally playing with fire by teasing that an African American female would be his running mate and then backing away from it. It now looks like that‚Äôs not going to happen. African American females are and have literally been the backbone of the Democratic party. To appease AA‚Äôs who may be disappointed he didn‚Äôt choose a black woman as his running mate, reports are surfacing that Biden is promising to nominate the first African American female to the Supreme court. Historically AA‚Äôs are fiercely loyal to the Jack Ass party and the Party seems to be betting that hatred of Donald Trump will transcend any massive disappointment that will come from an African American female being passed over as a running mate. This seems to be a gamble the campaign is willing to take. Christopher Arps is a managing partner with the public affairs and communications consulting firm Red Tail Strategies, LLC.

"230",4514,"https://www.unicef.org/kenya/stories/Day-of-the-African-Child-a-child-journalists-perspective","Day of the African Child: a child journalist√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s perspective","Armon Kiprotich,14, from Nairobi was a finalist of UNICEF Kenya's CRC@30 children's competition. For Day of the African Child 2020, he took part in a young reporters‚Äô media conference with regional UNICEF experts, to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on children in Africa. Such a vibrant and young continent, Africa, a lively and bright continent. Perfect, right? With coronavirus entering the ring with Africa, it wasn‚Äôt the only opponent we face. In fact, it is only the icing on the cake. Already rampant with political chaos and a terrible state of affairs, now this? Questions were popping up as the virus brought the continent to a standstill. But who was asking, and asking what? Everyone will start asking. When will we get back to work? How will the nation move forward economically? These are valid questions but with a young population, who is asking the African child? The common assumption that we children can‚Äôt comprehend a situation like this and form a sensible opinion or question is ludicrous. Luckily, UNICEF opened a forum where burning questions and possible solutions were expressed in the Young Reporters Media Conference. The conference consisted of a seasoned panel of UNICEF experts in the areas of health, education and children‚Äôs welfare. Proficient young reporters had topical questions for them. My question was: Is there a steady supply of water in rural/arid areas to ensure handwashing in these times of the pandemic? My question was not to look for an answer but to spark a conversation, because the problem had already shaken the continent pre-pandemic. This question was tackled by [UNICEF East and Southern Africa] Water and Sanitation Specialist Fahari Tunhuma, who stated that in arid areas most communities are nomadic, meaning their movement hinders accessibility of organizations like UNICEF to provide clean, treated water. This is scarce considering the communities use open surface water, which is often the opposite of sanitation. This brought forth a suggestion to provide water in public places like the market, where people meet. However, poor infrastructure has also proven a foe in providing proper sanitary measures and such a situation can only be fixed by good government, as far as I see it. UNICEF primarily focuses on children‚Äôs welfare. Being a child ambassador, I am bound to look at it from a child‚Äôs perspective and how it affects us. So the question of how this affects children comes up. As obvious as it sounds, it really speaks to children‚Äôs wellbeing health-wise, putting the life of a potential asset to society at the mercy of a clean cup of water. This humanitarian crisis is often overshadowed by more economic/financial constraints and woes. It is unfair for an urban child to expect to live to see his 80s, while a rural child may only live until his teens. It is not as often spoken about as national debts, but we owe our humanity to give attention and act upon this issue. Unfortunately, it will prolong its savage effects on the children who have to live with it long after coronavirus has died out. As much weight as my question carried, so did all the other questions asked. Take education: what about the continuity of learning? A teaching caravan moving community-to-community in rural areas was suggested. On abuse, what about children stuck at home with abusive parents who force practices such as FGM on their daughters? What about the physiological effects on a child during this period? What about the credibility of the information given? All of this is just the tip of the iceberg. Many are asking, some are experiencing. Us young reporters are trying to do our duty by questioning and putting situations from different angles to inform, unite and bring hope in times like these. In times of darkness. Some think that true talents are sports and singing but some children are also gifted in reporting on issues. These skills help nurture diplomats and politicians that will one-day shape the structure of society, depending on how their skills were sharpened. It is therefore the duty of interested parties like parents to support and hear their children seeing the media conference as a bell. With a young population comes a pool of fresh ideas and room for innovation that is waiting to be explored and exploited. New brooms sweep clean, they will wake up the dormant juggernaut continent of Africa. Better start using new brooms.

The stunning change in leadership comes as city police are under fire for their handling of massive demonstrations across the city spurred by the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""When your boss comes to you and says the community needs you,'' Lovell said he had to take on the important responsibility. ""I felt like if I in some small way could be the start for some community healing, it was my duty to do that,'' he said. Lovell, hired as a police officer in Portland in 2002, becomes the fourth African American to lead the city‚Äôs police force of about 950 sworn officers. Resch said she considered the community‚Äôs needs and believed the change was necessary. ""I have asked Chuck Lovell to step into the role as chief of the Police Bureau,'' she said at a noon news conference. ""He‚Äôs the exact right person at the exact right moment.'' She described Lovell, 46, as a ""most compassionate, humble, genuine to the core'' person and one who never set out to be police chief. ‚ÄúYou never wanted it,‚Äù Resch said. ‚ÄúYou were meant for it.‚Äù A Q & A with Portland's new police chief, Jami L. Resch. January 23, 2020 Beth Nakamura/Staff She said the decision was hers and that she will continue at the bureau in a role to be defined. She alerted Mayor Ted Wheeler of her desire to step aside about midday Sunday and met with Lovell also on Sunday. The mayor, who serves as police commissioner, approved of the move. Her resignation marks the second major shakeup for the bureau in the past year, following the sudden departure in December of Chief Danielle Outlaw, the first African American woman to lead the bureau, who took the police commissioner job in Philadelphia. Lovell said he was stunned to hear Resch‚Äôs request. ""She felt like now was the right time for her to step back and for me to step forward,'' he said. Tony Hopson Sr., director of the Self Enhancement Inc. youth and family support program and a leader in Portland‚Äôs African American community, lauded Resch and said her move to step down was ‚Äúvirtually unheard of.‚Äù He credited Resch‚Äôs courage and selflessness in trying to improve police-community relations at a crucial time. Resch said she made the decision after listening to people like Hopson. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve asked our community time and time again, what do we need to do. The Portland Police Bureau has made change ... but in the words of Mr. Hopson, those are changes but they are not the change. What the Portland Police Bureau has not done is stand up and say, ‚ÄòWe will be the change.'‚Äù Under Resch, Lovell led a new Community Services Division as an acting captain. The division includes the Behavioral Health Unit, a community engagement officer, a new homeless community liaison and a new civilian community engagement specialist. Lovell also served as Outlaw‚Äôs executive assistant. He was promoted to sergeant in July 2011 and lieutenant in July 2017. He has been active with the community, serving as a school resource officer at Jefferson High School, as a mentor in a ""Boys to Men'' program and on the board of Lines for Life, a nonprofit that operates a crisis call center. Lovell hasn‚Äôt been sworn in as chief yet and doesn‚Äôt yet have a contract or new salary worked out. Wheeler said he‚Äôs ""100 percent confident'' that Lovell is the right person for the job. ""Together we will work on meaningful and bold reforms,'' Wheeler said. The mayor acknowledged that the bureau has ""missed talent'' in promotions and succession planning. Lovell said he was completely caught by surprise by Resch‚Äôs request. He said he will work to convey the ""heart'' of the Police Bureau and its officers to the city. ""Let them know we are here to serve you, we are here to protect you,'' Lovell said. ""We fall down sometimes. We need to stand by each other.'' Lovell said he was most disturbed by the videotaped images from Minneapolis of George Floyd‚Äôs final moments in police custody and was struck by the ""lack of care or compassion'' by the officers involved. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what stuck with me - the thought that that‚Äôs an idea that could exist. The fight is not with each other. The fight is against that idea ‚Äì that people, institutions, the agencies that can harbor that feeling in their heart,‚Äù Lovell said. ""That‚Äôs the true enemy. That‚Äôs what we should all be fighting against.'' ""We have a lot of work to do,'' he added. ""We‚Äôll get busy doing that.'' Lovell described himself as a public servant. ""I‚Äôm humbled,'' he said. ""I‚Äôm going to show up every day with a servant‚Äôs heart. I‚Äôm going to listen. I‚Äôm going to care about the community and care about people in the organization. All I can do is be me.'' In response to questions about recent videos of police using batons and tear gas to clear protesters from Chapman Square, Lovell said he hadn‚Äôt seen the images. He glanced at his watch, noting that the ""last 20-ish hours have just been a whirlwind'' for him. ""We have systems of accountability. Our officers are well-trained. They‚Äôre out to keep the peace. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll look at whatever video there is to look at and we‚Äôll make some determinations,'' he said. ""I want to be clear. We want to give great service. We want to do the best job that we can, but I also want to protect officers and give them the tools they need to do the job that we ask them to do. That‚Äôs the only fair way to lead them.'' But in an indication of the firestorm Lovell has taken on, his appointment drew criticism as too little, too late from some activists and came amid lawsuits against the city over police crowd control tactics. A Portland couple filed a lawsuit Monday against the city in Multnomah County Circuit Court seeking up to $200,000 in damages for their exposure to tear gas during the June 2 protest. It follows a federal lawsuit filed last week by the group Don‚Äôt Shoot Portland against the city seeking a temporary restraining order to bar police from using tear gas and smoke. Portland‚Äôs Independent Police Review office, the intake center for complaints against police, also announced that it has received ‚Äúa high volume‚Äù of more than 2,300 contacts in the last week about the police response to the demonstrations, police funding or police contract negotiations as well as several dozen complaints about specific protest interactions with officers. The office also noted it has received eight commendations about police actions. The Portland African American Leadership Forum and Unite Oregon, meanwhile, released a statement rejecting the change in leadership as a positive step and calling for dismantling the Police Bureau. ‚ÄúThe relentless violence that Portland Police have inflicted on Black Portlanders since this city was founded cannot be wished away with a staffing change, because that violence is built into the concept of policing itself,‚Äù the statement said. The city‚Äôs most recent African American chief was Outlaw, who took the reins in October 2017 after rising in the Oakland Police Department to deputy chief. Charles Moose, Portland‚Äôs first African American chief, held the job from 1993 to summer 1999 and Derrick Foxworth was chief from 2003 to June 2006. Antoinette Edwards, retired director of the city‚Äôs Office of Youth Violence Prevention, described Lovell‚Äôs appointment as historic and said she told Lovell that he‚Äôs worthy of the post. She urged community support for him. Donald Dixon, a longtime counselor at Jefferson High School, said he got to know Lovell when he worked as a school resource officer at Jefferson. Lovell made kids feel comfortable and quickly became keyed in on what was going on in the school and in the community, Dixon said. Ronnie Herndon, a longtime African American community activist who is the director of Portland‚Äôs Albina Head Start program, said Lovell helped him maintain a healthy environment for at-risk students. He called Lovell ""a person who not only cares but he acts.'' Herndon said he knows the new chief will face some stormy days, ""but we‚Äôll be right there with you.'' Portland police Officer Daryl Turner, president of the Portland Police Association, called Resch‚Äôs move a ""sacrifice'' that ""will not go unnoticed.'' ""At a time when our nation, our city, our communities, and our officers are facing some of the most difficult days, it takes a person of incredible courage and character to balance the needs of everyone involved. I want to thank Chief Resch for her leadership and dedication to the organization,'' Turner said in a statement on behalf of the rank-and-file union. At the same time, Turner said, ""I look forward to working with Chief Lovell as we head into a new era in policing and continue to evolve and grow along with the needs of the diverse communities we protect and serve.'' Herman Greene, senior pastor at the Abundant Life PDX church in North Portland, joined a stream of supporters who praised Lovell at the news conference, saying Lovell cares about people and not politics. ""Today, the community got what it needed,'' Greene said. -- Maxine Bernstein Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Subscribe to Facebook page Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.

Pelosi, Schumer and failed presidential candidate Cory Booker took a knee together for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time that a Minneapolis officer was kneeling on George Floyd‚Äôs neck, while wearing African garbs in an effort to virtue signal and gain attention. ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship. Download Our Free Trump News App*** The Democratic leaders seemed to get a pass from the far-left mob who often call people out for cultural appropriation. Check out what the Daily Wire reported: Floyd, who is black, died last month after a police officer had his knee on the 46-year-old‚Äôs neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds during an arrest, as shown in viral video footage. Since the incident, all four officers involved in the arrest have been fired, investigations from the FBI and state law enforcement have been opened, and the officer at the center of the incident was taken into custody and charged with second-degree murder The three other officers involved have since been charged, too. Conservative activist Candace Owens made sure to comment on the ‚Äúphoto op‚Äù as she unloaded on Democratic leaders for pandering for the ‚Äúblack vote.‚Äù ***Get your Patriotic face masks with FREE SHIPPING today*** ‚ÄúI have to say‚Äî I thought there was at least one or two things that the Democrats wouldn‚Äôt stoop to for the black vote, but there is a apparently nothing,‚Äù Owens said. ‚ÄúDressing in African garb and getting on their knees for a photo op because it‚Äôs Monday, & only 4 months to November.‚Äù Pelosi also commented during her virtue signaling photo op. ‚ÄúThe martyrdom of George Floyd gave the American experience a moment of national anguish as we grieve for the black Americans killed by police brutality today,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis moment of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action as Americans from across the country peacefully protest to demand an end to injustice,‚Äù Pelosi continued. ‚ÄúToday, with the justice and policing at the Congress is standing with those fighting for justice and taking action.‚Äù WATCH the clip below: ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship. Download Our Free Trump News App*** Many leaders are coming forward in support of the kneeling movement including British journalist Piers Morgan. On Monday, Morgan suggested that President Donald Trump should kneel in the Oval Office to unite the country from the death of George Floyd. Morgan strongly supported the protests and demonstrations that took place, including the incidents where police officers as well as the National Guard knelt with the protesters. ‚ÄúDoubtless President Trump views Biden and all the new kneelers in the same ‚Äòson of a bitch‚Äô way he viewed NFL stars led by Colin Kaepernick when they took the knee during the national anthem,‚Äù Morgan wrote in The Daily Mail. ‚ÄúYet the cold hard truth for the President is that Kaepernick‚Äôs been shown by George Floyd‚Äôs murder to be on the right side of history, and Trump‚Äôs increasingly showing himself to be on the wrong side.‚Äù The comments from Morgan come in response to the President‚Äôs treatment of sport stars who kneel during the National Anthem. ‚ÄúIf President Trump really wants to make a statement about race and unity, one that rocks the entire world, then with the American people watching live on TV, he should simply take the knee in the Oval Office,‚Äù Morgan continued. ‚ÄúIn one stunning moment, Trump could heal so many wounds, unify so much of the country, and quite probably get himself re-elected.‚Äù What are your thoughts?

In a video last week, Brown spoke starkly about his feelings on Floyd‚Äôs death and being an African American service member. ""As the commander of Pacific Air Forces, a senior leader in our Air Force and an African American, many of you may be wondering what I'm thinking about the current events surrounding the tragic death of George Floyd,"" Brown said.

I have to state this now; otherwise I would probably be called a racist. Most people think that Black Lives Matter is a grass-roots, black created, black run organization dedicated to fighting racism. It most certainly is not. The Black Lives Matter movement is the creation of a group of a few very wealthy individuals, non-profit corporations, and the corporate media (incidentally, 90% of the U.S. media is controlled by only six corporations) https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 On the official Black Lives Matter website, BlackLivesMatter.com https://blacklivesmatter.com/ it states that Black Lives Matter is a global network foundation that is active in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. A global network! Who funds Black Lives Matter? It‚Äôs funded by billionaires George Soros (Open Society Foundation), Rob McKay (Taco Bell heir), the Ford Foundation, the Borealis Philanthropy, the Democracy Alliance, and many others. Not exactly what I would call a black run grass-roots organization. If these facts alone don‚Äôt cause you to rethink the whole Black Lives Matter thing, then you just aren‚Äôt paying attention. (Check out the links below) https://www.influencewatch.org/movement/black-lives-matter/ http://bmafunders.org/who-is-funding-black-lives-matter/ Black Lives Matter began in 2013 when the media suddenly started focusing a tremendous amount of attention on what they portrayed as the rise of unjustified, racially motivated killings of African American men by white police officers. That‚Äôs the way that the media portrayed it, but the facts say otherwise. Are police shootings of African American men on the rise? No they are not. In fact they are on the decline. According to the Juvenile and Criminal Justice Report, the rate of police killings of African Americans has fallen by 70% over the last 40-50 years. http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113 Are white racist police the biggest murderers of African Americans? No, far from it. The Black Lives Matter / media cabal is demonizing the police and portraying them as our number one foe, ‚Äì the enemy, but the facts once again say otherwise. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, 2,925 African Americans were murdered in 2018. 89% of them (2,600) were murdered by other African Americans. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls. That same year 209 African Americans (7%) were killed by the police (justified or otherwise). So let‚Äôs do the math here. 2,600 African Americans killed by other African Americans and 209 killed by the police (justified or otherwise). So who is killing African Americans? Other African Americans. But who does the media put all of their focus on? The ‚Äúwhite racist‚Äù police. So here is the big question, seeing that these are the clear facts why is the media twisting the truth? Why are they pushing the false narrative that racism is rampant, (didn‚Äôt we just have an African American president for eight years)? Why are they spreading this lie that racially motivated police shootings are up. Why are they spreading this lie world-wide causing racial divisions, protest, rioting, looting, burning, destruction and death? This global cabal has a secret agenda and African Americans are just being used as pawns in their world-wide game. This media produced false narrative reached its pinnacle with the death of George Floyd. The media has practically deified him. He‚Äôs in nationwide TV commercials, online ads, public service announcements, he‚Äôs on billboards (we are talking millions of dollars in advertising. Who‚Äôs paying for this?). His image is graffitied on buildings, businesses and walls from coast to coast, he‚Äôs on national magazine covers, and this list goes on and on. Hundreds attended his memorial service and funeral which included Al Sharpton (surprise!), The Governor of Minnesota, the mayor of Minneapolis, and many big name celebrities. So who is this George Floyd? Is he some great civil rights leader like Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela? No, ‚Äì he was a violent career criminal with a long criminal record. George Floyd was released from prison in Houston Texas in 2014 following an arrest for aggravated robbery. He had been in jail at least five other times. His arrest record included theft, drug possession, and criminal trespass. He was also the leader of a home invasion ring. They entered a woman‚Äôs home and Floyd threatened to kill her by pointing a gun at her stomach while they ransacked the place looking for drugs and money. (Check out the link to his criminal record) https://greatgameindia.com/george-floyd-criminal/ Nice guy huh. And this is the one that the Black Lives Matter / media cabal is using as their international poster boy. A violent career criminal. Well at least you can‚Äôt say that they don‚Äôt have a sense of humor. On May 20th 2020 Floyd was arrested again for trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a Minneapolis grocery store. This was the event that supposedly set off this insane world-wide media storm. As we know, Floyd died while in police custody and the four officers involved were all immediately fired and charged with murder and aiding and abetting murder. This was done before any investigation has been done, and before the cause of death was even established. The main officer involved, Derrick Chauvin was immediately tried, convicted, and hung. Not by a jury, but by the media. The media has so thoroughly convicted him that it is considered blasphemy of the highest order to even hint that he should be considered, ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù. The media has proclaimed it murder. Case closed! Well once again I hate to spoil the show by introducing more facts into this media circus of lies, but here it goes. According to the official Hennepin County Medical Examiner (not the private ‚Äúexaminer‚Äù paid for by the Floyd family legal team), George Floyd did not die from traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. The report stated that he died from a heart attack and the heart attack was a result of several factors. He had the narcotic Fentanyl in his system (which is 50 times more potent than heroin and the same drug that killed Prince), and he also had methamphetamines in his system. He also suffered from severe arteriosclerotic heart disease, and hypertension. All of that combined with his struggle with the police as they tried to subdue him is what caused him to go into cardiopulmonary arrest. Not just the fact that officer Chauvin had his knee on his neck. George Floyd received emergency medical care in the field, but he could not be resuscitated. Does that sound like murder to you? Read the report for yourself. https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/hennepinus/residents/public-safety/documents/Autopsy_2020-3700_Floyd.pdf Also the knee on the neck (neck restraint) maneuver was not something that the Minneapolis police reserved for use only on black people. They have used it over 200 times since 2015 on anyone they needed to subdue of all colors, white, black, brown, or whatever, and no one has ever died from it. So why are the Black Lives Matter Network / media cabal screaming at the top of their lungs that this was racism? A racially motivated murder! The Black Lives Matter Network / media cabal is not what it makes itself out to be. It is a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing. They pretend to be the liberal friends of African Americans, but in reality they are their mortal enemies. The policies that they so aggressively push cause nothing but more damage to the African American community. Under the guise of eliminating racism they push a policy to ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù. This is right on the front of the Black Lives Matter website. Under the guise of eliminating racism they push a policy that they call, ‚ÄúStop The Mass Incarcerations‚Äù. This is a policy that promotes the release of prison inmates before their time is up and putting them back on the street. Under the guise of eliminating racism they push for the decriminalization of drugs offenses, and the immediate pardon of all drug offenses with reparations paid to those convicted of drug offenses. So sum this up. In the African American community where there is the highest crime rate and the biggest problems with drug abuse, they push to release the inmates from prison and put them back on the streets, let drug use and drug dealing run wild, and then take away the police. What do you think the outcome of these policies will produce? More crime and drug abuse in the African American community. High crime and drug areas minus police equals hell, ‚Äì easy math. Policies that promote more crime and drug abuse in the black community are what I call anti-black policies. These guys make the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) look like angels by comparison. The ‚Äúliberal‚Äù media cabal (news, TV, movies, music, publications) who now are pretending to care so much about racism and black people have for decades pushed ideas that are very damaging to the African American community. They have promoted criminal sensibilities, thug life, promiscuity, and immorality to the African American community by way of their promotion of the worst aspects of rap / hip-hop culture. They‚Äôve been actively promoting the very things that feed our problems. Like feeding poison to a sick man. Here is a very timely quote from Malcolm X: ‚ÄúThe worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn‚Äôt taken, tricked or deceived by the white liberal, then Negros would get together and solve our own problems.‚Äù What we are seeing happening in the world right now under the guise of ‚Äúeliminating racism‚Äù, ‚Äì the destabilization of society, the protest, rioting, looting, burning, and killing are not spontaneous, grass-roots events. It‚Äôs all thoroughly coordinated by those at the top of the Black Lives Matter / medial cabal. They are indeed the enemy of African Americans, but they are actually the enemy of us all. African Americans are just being used as cannon fodder in their game of global domination.

Distribute this article Sadly common sense is lacking these days and this is very well explained and well thought out articulate and fucking obvious or it should be to people but it‚Äôs not so please spread this article around because people need to wake up And sadly things are being removed from the Internet so I always keep copies of things like this because they will be yanked This article has been read by over 250,000 people.‚Äî Kindly, Hezi We as a blk. People we dont need b.l.matter to solve our problem. The white mediator has always portrayed us as nothing.somethi ng come from nothing. Thanks. I,am with you all the way. Thanks. I am a White South African so let‚Äôs see how this goes down ‚Ä¶ I beg to differ on the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement. I believe the Black Lives Matter movement started out as a commentary, and call to action, on the treatment of African Americans dealing with mental health issues. Patrisse Cullors ‚Äì https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrisse_Cullors is the sister of Monty, her brother, who is plagued with mental health issue and it is through her observation of how he is treated, I believe by the city of Los Angeles, that she and two other women who had similar family issues to deal with that started the movement. It was primarily in response to the treatment by the police of African Americans with mental health issues, and how so often the police incarcerate mentally ill people. And how the system fails African Americans with mental health issues more than other communities, and hence, so many are incarcerated, erroneously by the criminal justice system where they are treated as criminals, when in fact they need psychiatric help The origins of the movement are shown in the documentary movie; ‚ÄúBedlam‚Äù ‚Äì https://bedlamfilm.com/ In which Monty‚Äôs journey is chronicled with his sister trying to help him. It started out as a call to action dealing with mental health issues and grew to a larger call to tackle the bigger picture of racism. But watch the movie and see for yourself. It is a documentary movie so you will have to sit through the narrative of how mental health issues still carry a stigma for many. if you are contending that most Black Americans have mental health issues, then Hillary agrees with you. Black American are Super Predators that need to be brought to heel (Hillary‚Äôs own words). That is the official policy of the Democratic Party. Vote Democratic to get the Black Americans under control. America,is a sick country Instead of bitching about how black people are treated in America currently(which is to say‚Ä¶.privelaged by infantilizing patronization and saintification) how about talking about how your fellow whites in South Africa are currently treated in South Africa by black South Africans and their commie black nationalist govt(like the blacks were in America a century ago)‚Ä¶watch Lauren Southerns‚Äô documentary ‚ÄúFarmlands‚Äù. And that old mental illness excuse again. Plenty of people have all sorts of mental health issues but don‚Äôt use it as an excuse to commit crimes including violent crimes, i have a mental illness and i don‚Äôt. Stop acting like mental illness is an excuse, you‚Äôre not empowering the mentally ill or helping them‚Ä¶your infantilizing them to their detriment Contrarian Deist. AGREE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but is the black community that needs to be instruct with this message. Everyone, Yes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but hate is evolving from the black lives. Racism doesn‚Äôt exist. How do I know this? It‚Äôs now politically incorrect to be white. One of the most influential people in my life happens to be African American. I love him and he helped turn me into a man when I was a young man in the US Air Force. I have the utmost respect for him. I‚Äôve never seen color and only seen character, thats how I was raised and how I teach my children. I look at my children. They don‚Äôt know race, if your a good person they want to play with you, if your not they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs our schools and the media that teach our children that we are all different. How sad it is when all children under one roof cannot love one another. Blood is red and as a fact all earthly humans wether white,yellow,brown,black, bleed red blood. We were all created equal and it is sad when any of us gets mistreated. It‚Äôs even sadder and wrong when a Billionaire uses US as political pawns for His Bravado and Pride. One thing forthcoming is for sure His life Will End and he does not have much time left on this planet. All who hate and choose to hurt and bleed us will pay and be judged by The Creator and they will have to answer to Our Lord as to why. THEIR FORTHCOMING PUNISHMENT is due as they are condemned already. The participants still have time to stop their ways of causing the Red Blood from spilling. Yes Our Red Blood . Let‚Äôs seek Peace and Love One Another As We Love Ourselves and let‚Äôs stop hurting each other‚Äôs children by Teaching hatred and disobedience vs Respect and Manners. WE ARE ALL IMPORTANT,UNIQUE,LOVED AND SMART HUMAN BEINGS. There is only one who Loves us so much that he sent his only begotten Son and yes JESUS The CHRIST OUR LORD was puched,kicked,pushed,brutally whipped,force marched with a Cross and Crucified for US All. He bled red as us and took upon himself the wrath due to us for our sins. May we remember his sacrifice, his love for us all and may we not let the pride of one evil man stop us from having Joy,happiness, love √†nd freedom in our lives irregardless of colored skin. When the hater dies and leaves this world we shall all be glad and prey that no other separates us from loving one another. Thank you for allowing to write my one opinion. Indeed and I greatly appreciate the citations in this piece. Hmmm‚Ä¶ This whole thread validates my decision to stay as far away from BLACK people as possible. Nothing good ever comes from interaction with hate filled, violent people who have been taught from birth to blame every problem on whites. Stay away from me and I will leave you alone. Approach me with intent to harm me and I will shoot you dead on the spot with no remorse. I wonder why you all just don‚Äôt move back to that Valhalla known as AFRICA if America is so bad. Dismissed, Gunny Sounds like Black Lives Matter trying to sound like what they think a white racist sounds like. nice try ‚Äúgunny‚Äù Good lord man. You and people futher lost are what fuels an organization to a BLM movement. Dont take away from what this writers intent is. And obviously this writer doesnt fit the narrative of what is being exposed. So your takeaway is deluded. If you cant hold moral then yield thine voice. fake poster LOL. Nice try‚Ä¶ At the outset this author states that BLM was created be a few wealthy individuals. He never names them and he never references where he got his information. One cannot simply make up facts to fit a specific narrative. You writing should be backed up by evidence. I believe this author is a shameless opportunist trying to be unique in being black and putting BLM groups in a negative light to feed the already hungry bigots looking for anything to discredit civil rights groups. It would be like me as a Hispanic writing about books stating that cesar chavez was a communist and just wrapping it in half truths. The White folks or ignorant would love to be my friend. This would prove that their racist ideologies were correct this whole time. Strange that nobody else has called him out for this. Yes, the author specifically names them AND gives links to where she got her information. First of all you can‚Äôt read clearly because Specific names were listed beginning with George Soros and you‚Äôre obviously not very intelligent and not reading very closely because you‚Äôre so steamed up ready to defend your dumb ass Black Lives Matter bullshit because you get all defensive without having any information just like a typical Uninformed moron‚Ä¶ But you keep saying he and she clearly states she‚Äôs an African-American fucking female you dumb moron now shut the fuck up The problem isn‚Äôt racism its bad priorities in many black communities. Continuing to point the finger at whitey and asking for black supremacy (favoritism) will go no where. The solution is to look within. But he did name names in the 4th paragraph. And did post links for references. That‚Äôs your takeaway? Thank you for this great article Those fbi stats are based on reportings from local police departments who are not required to report these events. So tell me then how trustworthy is your source. Dear Reader, At my daughter‚Äôs school, they taught the children about the George Floyd movement. She is one of the only black children in her grade, so it was uncomfortable for her while the teacher droned on about how black people have been oppressed. They taught it one-sidedly, and only talked about the false media information. I highly value your intriguing and amazing perspective of the matter. In my opinion, no matter what someone does or who they are, life is a gift. It should never be taken. Just because of Floyd‚Äôs felonious records doesn‚Äôt mean that he deserved to die. I agree that they are using him as a poster boy. I didn‚Äôt know that the officer wasn‚Äôt even put on trial. That is very unjust and goes against the laws of modern day society ‚Äì and the laws of humankind. Reading these comments, my heart burns. I have never understood racism. Why can‚Äôt we all be equal. White people, no body judges you if your hair isn‚Äôt blonde or eyes aren‚Äôt brown. We are black people, our ancestors taken from their homes by yours. We may look different, but we also have hopes, dreams, emotions. We don‚Äôt want to take your homes, or jobs, nor do we think we are superior. We just want acceptance. Racism is cruel. Thank you for providing your insight. God Bless, A black woman Yes as a white woman I don‚Äôt want an argument but I too have been judged! I was told I was hired for a job because I had a unique character and not for my intellect. I believe that all people need to be treated fairly and know that if someone does something wrong they should be punished . As far as killing someone I agree , they should not be killed ! But here is a thought , look at your little girl and think how would you feel if someone hurt her? Maybe you would just forgive them and go about your life? Maybe not? Your black ancestors(were they really yours? Was your family lineage slaves in America? Only a few percent of Black people in the West today are actually descended from Black slaves of White people, yet a large percentage of Blacks in the West pretend they personally, or their families, were directly slaves to make people feel sorry for them and make all White people feel guilty). For comparison, millions of Whites were stolen by Arab Muslims and sold into slavery to Black North Africans during the Barbary Slave trade. She‚Äôs that give every White person today the right to play victim and shame all Arab Muslims and Black people for perpetuity? And the Blacks that were enslaved by a few percent of White wealthy land owners in the U.S. FYI were sold into slavery to them by Black leaders in Africa after all. Stop playing the victim because of your skin color, stop making any and all White people feel guilty for perpetuity because of they are White. Learn all of history instead of this tunnel vision historical revisionism or half truth crap. Contrarian Deist. I never owned slaves burning stealing is not justice for George Floyd all tv turning black tearing down white history is racist gov kissing black ass is not justice George is standing before God just like we will that‚Äôs justice so will chauvin who will die in prison all of a sudden it‚Äôs black this black that there are other races besides black I feel a race war is coming it will destroy the us China Russia are waiting and laughing seeing us destroy ourselves over ancient history the gov cares nut him about nobody but there selves where all slaves stand up whites I‚Äôm not ashamed to be white you try to burn my house you‚Äôll burn in hell white brown or black U can be black and be racists. I think u just proved that. This was like if Samuel L Jackson‚Äôs character in DJango wrote this. Thank you for tech Nice manifesto, bro, but when you get pulled over by white cops, they‚Äôre not gonna give a fuck that you think you‚Äôre better than other black people. Damn you‚Äôre ignorant‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbro‚Äù ‚ÄúDamn you‚Äôre ignorant‚Ä¶ ‚Äòbro'‚Äù Touch√©. #BlackLivesMatter is a Marxist Organization that does not give a crap about blk lives !! Wake Up George Soros is helping #BLM replace all District Attorneys in major DEMOCRAT Cities with (she, he,they,zero) black person.. mostly (they identify as a woman) and they are replacing the judicial systems with Radical Leftists Progressive Social Justice Attorneys. Meaning black criminals are not prosecuted & returned out to offend again. Check out the crime rates since the date the DA was replaced (Blm & Soros started in 2018). Not only that they are prosecuting the cops & whites to the full extent of law. Since 2018 1 million ppl fled NY, Chicago & Detroit because of the high murder & crime rates. Innocent people are dying. Let Me Remind Everyone The Real Truth. After Jesus Threw Satan And The Rest Of The Angels Out Of Heaven They Were Angry At Jesus Because They Believed What Satan Told Them.

While You Keep Calling People Color Of Skin And Bringing Up About Those Police Officers Doing That To George Floyd, I Can See That You Are Also Apart Of This Skin Color Agenda.

And To Walk Away From This Worlds Ways. Lots Wife After Leaving Sodom And Gomorrah, Jesus Warned Her Not To Look Back And She Refused To Obey His Command. He Turned Her Into A Pillar Or Salt. And That Is Why Its Always Important To Never Look Back On This Worlds Sinful And Habital Wicked Ways You Were In.

Pleased that you are straight to the point‚Ä¶. WALL OF WORTHLESS TEXT. Glad you admit the brainwashing. Hmmm seems someone is upset that their brother in racial identity, is telling proven and factual information about the truth.. I believe MLKJr said I have a dream, that one day we‚Äôll be judged not by the color of our skin, but by the contents of our hearts.. perhaps you should think on that. This is so true the black race never had it so good thanks to the. White man Your info is wrong. Blm was created in 2013. Just like a true false test, any part that is false makes it all false. I press X to doubt.. BLM was and is recognized to have become a political and racial movement as early as 2013. Obama has to decide whether to count BLM as domestic terrorism.. he says so himself. So‚Ä¶ I think Obama would know when he signed the document stating that at this time BLM doesn‚Äôt qualify as Domestic terrorists. AT THIS TIME. I don‚Äôt think you even knew that I would like to thank for speaking your thoughts and being so forthcoming with facts and details. I am a mixed American of First Nations Cherokee and European ancestry. So I cannot claim white supremacy. Im just an American mutt. But it‚Äôs clear for anyone with an iota of functioning grey matter, would be wanting to destabilize the last Superpower in the world (U.S .A) with a resurgence of dormant racial stigma. MLK is rolling in his grave, And the needless death of all our countrymen in pursuit of equality was just a piss in the wind. Thank you for this article! It‚Äôs never easy to point the finger at your own and risk being ostracized by ignorance and blind hatred at them being held to account in truth and fact. I am a new fan and in unity with you Sir. How do I get a reprint of this article so I can share it with some people that seem to be riding along with other liberals. Some have not even had good history or government in school. For the most part, if you listen to media or read the publications, all you get is the liberal side. Not all, but most. Many people are hooked on screen time of any kind. I would like to print out a copy even with the comments if possible. I also respect copyright of the author, the Tribune, and any others that it might be a violation. I want to do it correctly if allowed. If you have any other articles or suggestions addressing this problem that could be shared, let me know this also. Thank you. Respectfully, B Thank you. Send me a request by secured encrypted email used the eHezi@hushmail.com address. ‚Äî Kindly, Hezi Aris, Publisher/Editor-at-Large I would agree with much what the article is saying about BLM, blacklivesmatter.com! But I‚Äôve always had a problem of ‚Äúour people,‚Äù using the system statistic, to prove an opposing narrative! As a former MN ‚Äúnative;‚Äù leaving in early 2020 for TX. I don‚Äôt trust BLM, FBI‚Äôs data base statistic, Police states; the Far-Left, the ‚ÄúFar-right,‚Äù the Democratic party, Republican party, or the Conservative party. All Mass Media is on this list, on the left and the right! I look at it(BLM) as an undercover crime racket, disguised as a humanitarian group‚Ä¶.which is sad, because the end game goes completely against what they claim to be about‚Ä¶..instead, they take advantage of the people who are hurting the most, and try to exploit their emotions, by instigating, and leading them to act ‚Äúout of pocket‚Äù which leads to more violence and ultimately headlines for the powers that be, which oftentimes leads to their followers being sent to prison, or an early grave sadly‚Ä¶..which they will also capitalize on, treating the people like disposable objects Facts Try posting the whole Malcom X quote next time. He also calls out conservatives, but I‚Äôm sure that doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative. ‚ÄúThe white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro‚Äôs friend and benefactor; and by winning the friendship, allegiance, and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or tool in this political ‚Äúfootball game‚Äù that is constantly raging between the white liberals and white conservatives.‚Äù Wow. Seems to me that adding the Conservative part made the narrative actually worse for the liberal viewpoint. From this standpoint, Malcolm X essentially states that the the Liberals are actively engaged in keeping the black person down and making up lies. At least the Conservatives can learn and become better because they are aware and aren‚Äôt purposefully lying and trying to cover it up. When you‚Äôre sanctimonious, believe you know better than everyone else and believing your own lies, you‚Äôll go down with your ship. Maybe that‚Äôs why huge numbers of minorities voted Republican this election cycle; the most since 1960. Maybe it‚Äôs also why huge numbers of black candidates showed up on Republican tickets, because they know the world isn‚Äôt perfect but the Conservatives will embrace them into office, whereas the Liberals will tell them how to act and vote, and if they don‚Äôt ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just not black‚Äù, because they know what is best for them. Obsessed over black on black violence, whites are reluctant to talk about Tim McVey, Steven Paddock, Jim Jones, Dylan Roof, Adam Lanza, and many more whites who kill more in a few minutes than so-called urban thugs kill in months. This comes as no surprise though for disparity is germane to the home of the brave, land of the free where revisionist history explains away rape, murder, and exploitation others went bound so whites could be free, where others went poor so whites could be rich otherwise one would ask free and rich as compared to who and what. Lol what white person is reluctant to talk about those named here? No one. What you‚Äôre saying is grossly false. White people have zero problems talking about serial killers. Or hiding the fact that white people kill people. Thats a black thing to hide blacks killing blacks. So check yourself. Not only do whites not martyr criminals in the US like blacks do. They execute them. Your statment takes a very typical approach of removing accountability and redirecting it onto others. This is why you all struggle. Because a great number of you want to take no accountability. When you get woke‚Ä¶ make sure your fully awake eh? Black lives matter is a demarcate oppritive an will not work fo Louisiana you‚Äôll r all fucking illiterate what about white lives matter I am all against a white trash doing wrong an if no respect of cops he need to get what he deservesu even getting his ass shot for resisting arrest but blacks think they can resist arrest cause black lives matter is taking up for them fuck that good will suffer for the bad if u know what I‚Äôm talking about !!!!! You sir are one willfully stupid MF. White lives have always mattered. They were, are, and always will be the only lives that matter in this country. Has there ever been a statute that authorized the taking of white life for failure to comply with directives? 17 states crafted such laws respecting blacks. That the slave is not to be ranked among sentient beings but among animals is undoubtedly the cardinal rule wherever slavery is permitted. The slave goes fed or famished, clothed or unclothed, sheltered or unsheltered at the will of the master. Over the slave the master‚Äôs power is as unlimited. Things are perfect in America when blacks apologize for bleeding on the boot of the white cop who kicks the shit out of him. You guys cheer when you see a Rodney King beatdown. And that‚Äôs why the Civil war was fought. But, hatred and lack of vision as to how the US has changed is why it‚Äôll always be a ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù cry from so many of the race baiters such as yourself. Are things perfect in the USA? Absolutely not. Can things be better? Yes. But, we, in a short span of HUMAN existence, established a country to get out under a taxing rule from a distant city and power center not aligned with our values (kinda sounds like the reason for the Electoral College??) . We managed to legally ‚Äì give Women‚Äôs suffrage, allow blacks equal footing (legally ‚Äì yes, there have been many instances of holding onto old ways, which are slowly losing grip as time moves on) through desegregation and ending slavery. We‚Äôve done this while also becoming the country where millions of non-whites flock here in the hopes they could have the ‚Äúracism‚Äù of the US and the ‚Äúlack of opportunity for colored people‚Äù that AOC and, I‚Äôm sure, you, believe we have. I do love how you are clenching onto the vestiges of the past like they‚Äôre somehow true now. Maybe if you paid attention, many countries, if not most, held those beliefs with slaves. And, slaves came in many colors. Africans did this to their own people too, let‚Äôs not forget. Slavery still exists in our world and it isn‚Äôt just with Blacks. Children and adults are being put into it all over the world and are being traded similarly as you bemoan above. And, the US is on the leading edge of trying to bring it to an end. We have work to do, as everyone and every nation does. We‚Äôll never be perfect, just like any business or person or situation will never be perfect. A belief of ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù means it‚Äôs already broken and fixing it will be a long term goal and we, as a country, can‚Äôt ever think status quo is good. Foresight to understand that everything and everyone needs to constantly adapt to keep moving forward in a positive manner is what‚Äôs needed. Instead, people like you, who have obvious anger issues and contempt, want to drag down the masses with your garbage. What good are you providing the world by regurgitating something that you were never a part of? What good does your stance do for anyone, other than the left who loves to incite violence to make everyone keep re-living previous sins of past generations? You‚Äôre simply attempting to continue all the BS so we never move past it. You should want growth, not retribution. Retribution to many people who had nothing to do with any of this and who want to move on and make everyone successful. If you had the slightest concept of ‚Äúa rising tide lifts all boats‚Äù, you‚Äôd stop trying to throw yourself and others overboard like an anchor in hopes you can capsize as many as you can in order to make up for something in the past. If you did have the slightest concept of that, you‚Äôd be looking for ways to reel in the others (both PoC and non-PoC) and get everyone going in the same direction. Dragging everyone down does nothing to further the argument and disenfranchises more people, including many PoC who have moved on and are trying to make the world a better place. But, I‚Äôm guessing by your vitriol above, I lost you long ago with my facts, compassion and awareness of the best ways to move forward. Sir, you are racist. Many black people are underestimated. Every time a cop sees a black person they are going to suspect that they are breaking the law. but they don‚Äôt do that to white people. I wish you people would understand that since 1619 all the way to now 2020. Black people have had fewer opportunities. We were property. Not even considered human. But you white people were. You should think about that and do some research on all the WICKED things that white people have done to black people. It was not only black people who were slaves, the Irish were also sold as slaves among others. It was the African people who actually started selling slaves and a few even owned slaves! You talk about how everything was handed to white people, you need to freaking research because ALOT of whites worked their asses off and still dont have crap. And as for whites taking from blacks huh! Native Americans lost a hell of alot more! So dont hollar black lives matter when it should be ‚ÄúNO LIVES MATTER TIL ALL LIVES MATTER‚Äù! It‚Äôs not only blacks that some cops automatically assume are criminals, there are whites, Mexicans & others who get same treatment. Stop resisting & do what cop says and get a whole different outcome! I‚Äôm a white/mexican female and I learned the hard way. Thats a lie. If you look poor which includes white people the cops will think you did something. We need to realize that its the 1% that is getting the attention off them and onto the people. If you are poor you will be treated like a criminal no matter what store you walk into no matter what cop. Trust me Ive been there. United we stand and divided we fall dont forget that. Dont place your trust so easily in something so insane. We need to be standing together as a whole to beat out the 1% that are trying to take over the world and guess what they are not all white but the majority is in the states. And they want to keep the black person down. How can you not see that? How can you not see they are using media and self proclaimed profits funded by rich white guys to trick everyone??? Why aren‚Äôt we focusing on them anymore? Why aren‚Äôt we focused on climate change and human divinity??? Because they took it off them and got us fighting each other. UNITED WE STAND< DIVIDED WE FALL Whites don‚Äôt martyr criminals? So the square is round! Your precious fiat features the portrait of a criminal on all but the $5 note. Well I suppose you don‚Äôt consider whipping the bare back, branding the face, severing the hand or foot, or gouging out the eye criminal acts. Not only do whites martyr criminals they immortalize them by erecting statues to honor them around the country. I know, I know you are one who believes slavery with all its horrors is the best thing that ever happened to blacks. I pray folks like you burn in house fires. This is why you all struggle. Because a great number of you want to take no accountability. When you get woke‚Ä¶ make sure your fully awake eh? Wow! Reading through the response, all I keep seeing in my mind is a mic dropping followed by a nuclear explosion‚Ä¶lmao Total racist. WRONG.. The DRIVE BY SHOOTING was invented in the early 1980‚Äôs. They have killed over 200,000 black people of all ages in those 40 years. The #1 THREAT to a black person in the USA is another black person. Period. Get off the blame game, you have played it for my entire 60 years and I for one am sick of hearing. Or‚Ä¶Just start that race war you want so bad and we will end it for you. Dismissed, Gunny Black on black crime is incredibly relevant. Each instance has both a black victim and a likely a black criminal vs cop interaction. How can anyone say this isn‚Äôt relevant? Less black on black crime is a x2 multiplier for black lives as it saves the victim and the criminal black criminal from interacting with police. BLM should be renamed to BLKBWCM (black lives killed by white cops matter) as they clearly are not focusing on the root causes of ‚Äúpolice brutality‚Äù. Keep blaming whitey and it will get you nowhere. BLM is creating racism not fighting it! You act as only white people are mass or serial killers. This is false. Anyways even if it were true, these individuals are few and far between on very rare occasions, whereas black gang people are killing other blacks(and whites, and Asians, male and female, gay and hetero, young and old) EVERY DAY in big cities. Hardly comparable. Contrarian Deist Tapestry of adversaries polarized by race, class, wealth, education, and traditions all under a flag of unity-proffered! America has no culture, no society. Only 300 million individuals who collaborate from time to time for self-interest. The list of core American values is a total fabrication. American people don‚Äôt compete; they price fix, monopolize, and trade from within. They don‚Äôt believe in freedom and justice but injustice and bondage instead. If there is a genuine American value it is discrimination! And discrimination is something for which Americans have demonstrated they are willing to kill, and die. To structure the white among the numerous foreign types Columbia University Professor Thomas Jesse Jones said New York ‚Äúmust use every agency of state.‚Äù This is the every essence of systemic racism whites cannot in the wake of its devastation acknowledge. The Library of Congress catalogs, photos, and records of 3640 lynchings of black people. Not a single one was ever prosecuted. The institute does not keep child pornography instead it keeps photographs of blacks dangling by the neck with castrated genitals crammed in their gaping mouths for the sole purpose of communicating to future white generations how they should treat black people! There are in the US 143 firearm manufacturers. None are black owned or operated. In a snapshot, the firearms produced on any given day all are under white control. Somehow large numbers of guns with appropriate ammunition make their way to inner city youth. I wonder how that transpires. If BLM is responsible it can only be with white cooperation. Do you have an answer; I am all ears! Les Taha, Thank you for your timely article. I value your input and take it seriously. The important link on the George Floyd autopsy is no longer active. Either someone has removed it or the file has been moved. It is important this information continues to be readily available to the public. It is important that more voices like yours make it to the mainstream, and that all blacks are not vilified or backlashed against because of the Black Lives Matter movement. Whites need to stay level-headed and remember not all blacks are in on the vicious BLM games afoot. I hear stories of blacks helping whites during riots when they cannot even go outside (like to the grocery store) for fear of violence, for one thing. I am sure there are many other stories. I am angry with the BLM and related black/brown power movements, but not all blacks. I hear this from other whites, as well. Articles like yours help to keep reminding us of the other kind of blacks in the country and world, and to help bring the peace between the races. Some of the most astute material refuting BLM truly does come from the black community. They are bringing in relevant articles and evidence to the issue as if they have unique personal experience as well as a kind of sixth sense to find the right answers and clear the clouds. This input is absolutely vital to breaking up the ugly cabal. Laws do not supplant; they layer. Like a beet at the bottom of a salad bowl makes its presence known atop the leafy greens, the inhumanity of American slave codes influence current legislation. Not only do whites believe it is just to kill unarmed blacks, they take pleasure in doing so! Americans lament slavery but lack courage to so admit. They lament administering the punishments authorized by slave codes, gouging out the eye, branding the face, cutting off the hand, cutting out the tongue, castrating, and hanging (Stroud‚Äôs Sketch, 1827). Whites have been regurgitating the same narrative for four centuries. Please believe them. You are unwanted; leave these assholes to themselves! They despise BLM because the movements message is do not accept mistreatment with grace! Trying to make American democracy work for all is like trying to make a left shoe accommodate a right foot. Neither were designed for such purposes. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney said ‚Äúthe black is not and never can be a citizen of the United States. ‚Äù He meant ‚Äúnever‚Äù and his words hold true today. I do not advocate trying to change America, a racist nation from day one. A thing can be only what it is. Discrimination is the defining characteristic of America, a country full of people who hate love and love to hate. If you are black and serving in america‚Äôs armed forces, get out and stop defending your oppressor. Put this regressive country in your rearview mirror and go live where law does not classify you ‚Äúquadruped‚Äù! I can understand about the BLM movement being what it is, and just trying to put African Americans in a bad light What is insulting is the way you talked about George Floyd. No matter if he was a criminal or otherwise. It‚Äôs still doesn‚Äôt excuse or vindicate the man who contributed to his death. How come you don‚Äôt speak of the cops bad past or background? Sounds pretty biased to me. Chauvin had a disturbing history as well. 16 complaints against him. The precinct itself was known for being racist and harbored rogue police. Tell the whole story instead of being one sided. Floyd is a scumbag. If it was a white person killed in the same manner (which happens twice as much as blacks ) you wouldn‚Äôt give a shit. The media would not give a shit. Floyd‚Äôs family is better off with the result of his death. He was never there anyways . He has always been in prison. He likes to stick guns into pregnant women‚Äôs stomachs so he can rob them. Stop the BS!!!!!!!!!! And where would that be, I pray? America defined democracy, liberalism, freedom and all that mushy gushy stuff. America defined autocracy not democracy. I believe we have to credit the Greeks for that. Interestingly, no one submitting anti-BLM comments mentioned anything about the activities of the KKK, you know that wonderful community organization that has been practicing democracy since 1865. Could it be because like your coward in chief, you all are ‚Äúunfamiliar‚Äù with the organization? No, it‚Äôs because the KKK has ultimately been castrated. Even the ultra-liberal and partison Southern Poverty Law Center recognizes this. There are less than 5000 known KKK members across the US, for an organization who has been tracked for almost a century. From what was a very prevalent organization to what it is now, they‚Äôre a non-issue. I‚Äôm not saying what they stand for doesn‚Äôt show up in other organizations, but it doesn‚Äôt show up as the KKK. Your straw-man argument is merely deflecting from the fact that the BLM ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù are the single greatest domestic manmade destruction in the history of the US. The 1960‚Äôs (that‚Äôs a decade) saw about $1.2B in current dollars. These riots over a week saw about $2B in INSURABLE damages, which means far more in terms of actual damages (the ones that won‚Äôt be built back under the BLM mantra of ‚Äúinsurance will pay for it‚Äù) And if you don‚Äôt think it was BLM, then why didn‚Äôt the cities burn when Biden was named President-Elect by the media? They would have had Trump been named the same. BLM is relevant, KKK is a has-been. Stop trying dig up dead bodies of the past for your arguments to deflect from what‚Äôs actually happening. My name is Amber Barton! I‚Äôm the mother of 5 mixed children. I am soooo sick of the racism that‚Äôs going on. My 20 year old almost hates me because I‚Äôm white. Really? I raised her! This racial mess is nothing more than a mess! My children are amazing! My son is a football star with straight a‚Äôs and my other kids play basketball and volleyball with A‚Äôs! We live in Wyoming and I‚Äôm sick of this racist BS that people are trying to fill my kids full of! We are Christian and ALL LIVES MATTER! Thank you Jesus! Amber, I assume you are familiar with America‚Äôs One Drop Rule which perpetuated a concrete Wall between whites and all others. Under American law your bi-racial children were never meant to considered anything but slaves. The problem with laws is that they are joined at the hip to their unintentional consequences. I am so sorry for your pain but you can thank the construct of white privilege and wonderful america for the turmoil in your home. The country and its hate-inspired prevailing social attitude toward race renders it an entity on constant suicide watch. You will comply or risk losing your whiteness and the privileges inherent to absence of skin color. I‚Äôm a little sick of the convenient strawmanning of a white privilege that now, as a politically and rhetorically expedient device, can shoulder the blame of every negative aspect of life in America, even among the inherently complex dynamics of the family. It‚Äôs absurdly reductive and even willfully ignorant to assign the source of these kinds of issues to an academic social theory that has only surfaced within the last 30 years as a one size fits all, psuedointellectual cartoon mallet to beat all your problems, real or perceived, over the head until you feel they are silent, not resolved. Amen Just read the article and comments, BLM is just another way to keep hatred alive. Hate breeds money peace doesn‚Äôt. If Americans would start getting along and stop the madness the billionaires would lose their ‚ÄúCASH COW‚Äù which includes and is not limited to Hatred and racism. Racism is very much alive and there are racist people who will continue to push their agenda. If you don‚Äôt believe it, try organizing a peace rally the fascist will have your head on a platter don‚Äôt mess with their agenda which is keeping the rich richer and the poor poorer. There is no need for the BLM to keep hate alive in America, as hatred fuels the national engine of greed. We do not collaborate; we compete. The disease of democracy is spread out costs and concentrated benefits. While many compete in the race only one crosses the finish line first. Mountains of literature advance degradation of blacks. Dr. Samuel Cartwright, a Medical doctor advanced the insidious idea that blacks who were unhappy with the condition slavery suffered from a disease he coined drapetomania. And, the precious constitution is nothing but a slave code in disguise, one that pledges the full force of the country to suppress rebellions by those classified 3/5ths human beings. Get this through your minds once and for all time, black people do not exist for white prosperity and pleasure. Nor do white people exist to visit pain on people of color. Your monomania is showing. Well the stop ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù pain on people of color. You know I wonder how america went from criminalized to compulsory education for black children. I am certain before doing so the system of free and appropriate education for all white children was geared to produce leaders and followers. Look I get it and think that if I were white I too would be hesitant to relinquish my advantaged position in the fruit of the poisonous tree. But I do not believe I would deceitfully disavow the 400 year history of statutory privilege from which I benefited and continue to benefit. People who steal land, create plantations, and exploit through violence the labors of other human beings to operate the same while coining themselves ‚Äúsaints‚Äù are no doubt devils! ‚ÄúThe slave can own nothing nor profit from his own enterprise. He can make no contracts nor can he wed. The slave is subjected not only to the will of the master but to the will of all white people. When he becomes too refractory to be of use, the slave maybe killed by the master with impunity‚Äù (American slave code). The pen in white hands is like a nuclear weapon! I‚Äôve been watching Crossing Many Rivers on PBS by Mr. Gates. I found it interesting that within the first fifteen minutes of this documentary, it mentioned that different African groups fought each other and the chiefs of the winning tribes made slaves of the members of the losing group. I never knew that black africans made other black africans slaves prior to the white slave trade took place. Thank you for writing this piece of realness I commend you .why aren‚Äôt black life‚Äôs matter telling everyone to stop commenting crimes & stop shooting each other.why don‚Äôt sport star tell people the same thing instead of crying about injustice and put there money to good use buy paying poor people bills or buy housing or solar panels for free electricity or buying laptops for school .or how about rappers who could send more positive messages in there music or maybe white people are the devil one thing I do know is that countries like China are watching and waiting for us as Americans to stumble Just to inform you, there is a difference between a black man shooting another black man over some type of feud and white men killing black people solely based on the racism rooted in them. For example, the officer responsible for killing George Floyd had no real reason to kneel on his neck for as long as he did (if there even is a reason to kneel on someone‚Äôs neck until they die). It was based off of racism and this country has seen enough black folks killed at the hands of racism. The black lives matter movement simply fights for equality among all ‚Äúno real reason to kneel on his neck for as long as he did (if there even is a reason to kneel on someone‚Äôs neck until they die). It was based off of racism and this country has seen enough black folks killed at the hands of racism‚Äù I guess you couldn‚Äôt read some of the facts stated in the article. 1) Knee on the neck is standard restraint practice when someone is resisting to the extent that it is deemed necessary. 2) He died from HEART FAILURE. If you can say ‚Äúi cant breath‚Äù you are in fact breathing. 3) There is nothing present to account for racism. You are applying that label to it because that‚Äôs what you WANT to see. The whole thing was an unfortunate but nevertheless over-hyped pile of garbage used to kick off a crap media agenda. I mean this isnt some secret information. Just Google George Soros and read a bit ‚Ä¶ Hi the officer that killed George Floyd Knew him and worked with him. How do you know what feud could have been going on between the two? We would never know. The officer in question would never say he did it on purpose or that would give him first degree. Personally I think they had a feud and it wasn‚Äòt a race thing. But that‚Äôs just an opinion just as it is yours that he killed him because he was black. Thats the main problem and what the writer is saying. We decided based on our opinion on what happened based on zero facts and the media played right into it. Children were being killed by the police and yet none of them are being used as a poster child for this movement. NOT ONE. Don‚Äôt you think they would be a better fit for this movement? Innocent black children not a career criminal? It‚Äôs so messed up. The Only Thing To Respond To This Comment Is. You Are Being Deceived Too.

After battle the winner would round up surviving enemy warriors and sell or trade them away to whites. They did this to prevent future warfare, not because they were too fucking lazy to work their own farms. But I am confused about the point you are trying to make. Do you suggest that African participation justifies North American slavery? Can you please send your article to the WHITE HOUSE. POTUS TRUMP AND VPOTUS PENCE AND ALL REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT BLM IS OBVIOUSLY A TERRORIST MARXIST GROUP. No doubt about it. It is funded by the wealthy organizations as you mentioned Headed by the moat evil 90 yr old soros Ask our Republican politicians through your channel what their plan is when they win in November when these thugs and criminals Are a thousand times more violent and It will be soros Obama‚Äôs hillary‚Äôs plan to see America burn to the ground. What ARE THE PLANNING TO DO do to DEFEND AND PROTECT US AMERICANS FROM THESE CRIMINAL DEMOCRAT SUPPORTED BLM AND ANTIFA AND RADICALS AND EXTREMISTS SOCIALIST COMMUNISTS ? WOW. I am a white woman, I am not a racist. But have gotten a rotten feeling in my gut about BLM movement and.. felt its making tension between races not making it any better. And this sums it up. Discussion needs to be presented on this matter. THANK YOU. The article is true and well written. BLM has been misleading. It does not care about all lives or all black lives. They are anarchist. They do nothing for the black comminity. Only interested if a black is killed by a white officer. If you want more unrest and chaos they are using the left to bring it. Look at the demise of large dem cities in our country. I am a 69y/o black woman, it‚Äôs so clear to me. #walkingwithkimberlyklacik Hi there ‚Äúwhite woman‚Äù, I too am a white woman, or girl, whichever term is preferred. Let me kindly inform you on a few things, the black loves matter movement is not meant to cause tension between races, the white people killing off innocent black people has done enough of that!! The movement is simply meant to bring awareness to the innocent black lives taken from us. It is meant to fight injustice and fight for equality among all. All the love!- Your fellow white woman/girl. You can thank the Democratic Party for that. They are the ones who voted in Jim Crow laws wanted to keep segregation keep them in chains started up the KKK and also the ones who instilled a victim mentality in people. Let‚Äôs also not forget that the harsh prison sentences for drug possession and the like were also instituted by democrats I think you know the big names Biden, Clinton yeah that was them. They keep people so reliant on them that all they can do is scrape the bottom of the barrel instead of actually trying to fix things. But here‚Äôs a tip for people who don‚Äôt want to get shot take your knee and hands on the back of the head it‚Äôs kind of hard to misinterpret that. The innocent ones that are shot are a tragedy but let‚Äôs actually read some facts about 90% are not innocent the other 10% is and the officers deserve whatever sentence they are given. But can I ask have you even looked at statistics and seen that most black Americans are killed by other black Americans? You know all those black children killed by BLM supporters or the violent people who joined where are the protests for them and the looting and rioting too? Also if the movement is meant to bring justice to all why has BLM not paid anything to the businesses their supporters have destroyed? Also where is the justice for all the people they have harassed and attacked in public? It‚Äôs really funny their message smells of hypocrisy and falsehoods continuously. I have to say they should change their name to Black Lives Matter Only When They Are Killed By A Bad Cop! I‚Äôm a white man who also happens to be decently perceptive, if I can make that claim. I‚Äôve spent the summer telling friends and colleagues that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs just something wrong‚Äù with BLM though I can‚Äôt (and am not safe to) try to explain how. I‚Äôm an artist, not a pundit or journalist, so I stay on the sidelines, but I trust my gut. And my gut told me right after George Floyd exactly all the things Leslie is laying out here. I appreciated reading this. It makes me feel I‚Äôm, just possibly, not quite the bitter racist everyone has labeled me. It is not the job of BLM to solve a race problem whites created. Instead it is their mission to balance the scale. What is good for goose is good for gander. Who do you think funds white supremacy? Or are you one of those deniers of reality who dismisses a 400 year phenomenon? Newtonian physics teaches us forces are equal and opposite; get ready for the big payback! Your comment describes exactly the motivation and ideology of BLM and Black supremacists. They don‚Äôt want equality, they want revenge. Mob rule and veiled threats only divide us further. And BLM is addressing these problems how? Which was the whole point of this article. Well, you pretty much summed up my thoughts on the matter, but much more articulately. I‚Äôm intrigued and a fan. üôÇ This was the most upside down thinking, turning and twisting the facts, this how Hitler started getting supporters. Our Jails were setup to keep rural towns employed , take away farming, you now have a correctional facility built to keep it town from disappearing. How is white privileged a defense for a rich white kid that killed a family under the influence, or using and selling pounds of cocaine excusable. The system is rigged. I will not paint all blacks as saints but enough is enough. Let our neighborhoods flourish. Inside gun sales, only providing drug rehab when the rich and middle class whites get hooked. Go to a black school you will see less funding provided in comparison to whites . The school system titles a school gifted or talented in a Spanish and black neighborhood to allow basically whites to attend, after the gentrifying of the neighborhood, the school reverses back to zone school to keep minorities out. Enough is enough. Read this article again with an open heart. Leslie has stated plainly what is going on. It is the Truth!!! These BLM people, including Obama and Hillary HATE AMERICA AND WANT IT DESTROYED! I am a 70 year old black woman that remember ‚Äúburn baby burn‚Äù in the 60s when radical black groups supported by communist whites and blacks called for exactly what BLM thugs are calling for: put down or kill the police, kill everyone that disagrees with them, take over our cities and states and the whole United States for communist rule. They were then and are now full of demons! My prayer is that this movement is put down so completely that it can never rise again! Agree. The other 69 y/o black woman. # walkingwithkimberlyklacik Your misguided. Give different groups within the country a reason to believe they are being mistreated. Stoke the resentment over and over. Rub and scrape the resentment raw . This leads to chaos, riots and the destruction of the glue that holds the country together. Marxism will rise out of the ashes and build the Utopian Marxist World. This strategy hasn‚Äôt changed since the middle 1800‚Äôs when it was given legs by Karl Marx. Only problem is that Marxism has always and will always end in murderous tyranny, starvation, deprivation and mass misery. Sit back and watch‚Ä¶.. here it comes‚Ä¶.vote for the democratic Marxist socialists. This article was well written and the discussion needs to be taking place across the country instead of the childish politically engineered fighting that has created the most dangerous division seen in this country since the civil war. In the simplest, street language I can use, this always comes back to Trump who coincidentally became the man right after our first black president. Having voted for both, I see Trump as the epitome of ‚Äúhustling.‚Äù He makes Don King look like an amateur, and when I use the term hustling it denotes both positive and negative behaviors. I have worked with (and for) many hustlers and realize the value and the detriment of their efforts. They make everyone uncomfortable, not just when they create chaos and wrongdoing, but especially, when they produce positive results. The fact that Biden‚Äôs hustle never was appreciated by his own party in past presidential bids makes him a dubious candidate, and I thought that Kamala would be the #1 choice early in 2019. I will be surprised if he is elected, that he serves as anything more than a set up to place her in charge before 2021 comes to an end.

Just because someone is focusing on something doesn‚Äôt mean they are ignoring something else. Also, any movement can have any crazy person attached to it. I have felt the same as you in the past‚Ä¶ and some of these feelings I‚Äôm truly struggling with. I can‚Äôt even usually explore my feelings as I am white and people jump down your throat immediately and call you racist when you are trying to understand the statistics. Through that struggle and searching out knowledge because of it I have learned that blacks kill blacks so much because of the basic injustice in the social and justice systems of our government that end up keeping entire groups of people in a place where crime feels like the way it has to be. That‚Äôs kind of the point‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why they are killing each other. Yes the whole police against the black man is another issue but if you dig deeper it‚Äôs about so much more about what causes it in the first place. Maybe if the movement is for the wrong reasons driven by the wrong people you could help drive it for the right reasons with the right people. You are black‚Ä¶ your voice matters more than a white persons. Unfortunately no matter how much a white person is truly not racist or trying to help there always still seems to be someone who has a problem with it. I‚Äôm not sure if the people running Black Lives Matter or funding it or whatever have good intentions or not. I‚Äôll explore it since you addressed it‚Ä¶ if they were though‚Ä¶ just trying to help‚Ä¶. why would it matter what color they were? Can you stop saying ‚Äúmedia cabal‚Äù? I‚Äôm not sure if you realize but this is a highly antisemitic term that people use to refer to any ‚Äúworld wide controlling secret conspiracies‚Äù. Oh please. Very few people who refer to the media/msm and/or nwo cabal are referring to jews or jews only. We all know this cabal is multiracial, so enough with this ‚Äúits anti Semitic‚Äù bullshit! Contrarian Deist Thank you for being a voice of logic and reason. Great article. You need to be on the news and good luck with your book . Americans need to wake up and stop listening to the liberal media. Unfortunately like you said most of the news is controlled by 6 major news corporations. Also people should be informed that the majority of colleges are liberal indoctrination faculties. Thank you. It takes heart to write something like this when it feels like everyone is against you. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going through or what you‚Äôve been through but I appreciate the thought and effort to try and make this country right. Keep fighting for us and know that there is a majority thats with you Twisting and avoiding facts . You won‚Äôt get far . I have the ability to be open to hear both sides and read your article fully. You are delusional . Right hate will not solve anything. I don‚Äôt know about other parts of the country but I have noticed race relations get better where I live since I was young. Before someone tells me who I am I am a. 69 ur old white man in upstate SC. I could go on about what‚Äôs going on in our country. But I going to there bottom line‚Ä¶. MONEY and the only bottom line‚Ä¶ GOD So i would like to understand this movement: They are trying to be respected and heard by disrepecting two of the very few things that unite you as US citizens (your flag and your anthem. Say what you want, but kneeling and acting all entitled while the anthem is played is complete and utter disrespect to everything your country is), while also having as their emblem the name and image of proven criminals?? I have seen they also attack and mistreat people who agree with their cause but not with their methods. Good luck with that! hope you get all the integration you deserve Love, J Thank you, I have been serving my country for over 34 yrs. Domestic and abroad I have stood for Anyone‚Äôs rights, but I am a coward to say what I know to be true, but now, you have said it for me. This is the most insidious implementation of willful souls marching into social segregation. Leadership is always guilty when no vision of attainable goals is laid out to inspire change. I have lived most of my life in a world of true brotherhood, all races, religions, ethnicities, sacrificing for one another out of love and this narrative is not the way. Pushing the agenda of diversity will never unify. I am sincerely grateful for you speaking for me The national Democratic Party are using blacks and The black live matter movement for their presidential election. The Democratic Party is about power and control and using blacks again and again. This time they are using the black lives movement to raise money and get out the vote for a mentally deficient candidate. Are blacks getting not tired yet of being used over and Over again? The democrats want To Legalize illegal immigrants and let illegals in the country by the millions for votes at the expense of black Americans. Once the illegals are able to vote They will be the largest voting block to cajole and the black Americans will be left in the dust without a voice. Never trust the Democrats. We need a third party in America called the Anti corruption Party for sane immigration and fiscal policies. Mentally deficient. Have you even been paying attention to the clown at the helm? Are you really that stupid? you must be taking about Pelosi snd shumer. Maybe Meathead rob rinner I‚Äôm a 63-year-old white man with more black friends than white. That ‚Äúclown‚Äù is better than any president this country has ever had and easily more qualified to lead this country than any democrat. Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs family has descendants who created the KKK. She is not for equality for anyone. Adam and Nancy are stalling our recovery for political reasons. They are destroying our country by their inaction and need to be voted out of office, or better yet run out on a rail. How much Left Wing Kool Aid have you drunk? You do know aside from the original kidnapping of Africans all of the other problems stem from the Democratic Party right? Open up a history book not made in the US and it will tell you who actually instigated most of the problems they face today. Jim Crow Segregation harsh prison sentences all Democrats. They then put together ‚Äúprograms‚Äù that were meant to keep the Africans tied down and reliant and pliable along with taking over the school systems. Why do you think they don‚Äôt teach proper history anymore? The left side wants to literally reform into something that cannot be sustained or cannot be allowed to thrive. The left is arguably going the way of communist China and also Russia and let‚Äôs face it you speak like your original post there they send in the military police to re-educate you with the butts of their guns and a few other toys. If you do it again they walk you out of your home and one of two things happen they shoot you or they take you to a military base work you to near death and then they shoot you.The prison problems your two big names Clinton and Biden you know the guy currently running for the presidency against the orange idiot who can‚Äôt keep his phone out of his hand? Yeah that‚Äôs their fault along with the rest of their left wing radical buddies. Right on. ‚Å∑ A fraud is a fraud is a fraud. BLM is a fraud. A hustle. When you say Black Lives Matter and completely ignore the 1000‚Äôs of lives lost by murder then you are‚Ä¶ding ding ding‚Ä¶.a fraud. Nothing changes that. Defend BLM with all the verbage you want, that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that a genuine concern for black lives would not ignore the 1000‚Äôs of lives lost due to civilian murder. Guess who would have no problem ignoring those 1000‚Äôs of lives? A hustler spinning a fraud. Hustlers have no problem being so disingenuous. The BLM website claims the killing of Mr. Brown in Ferguson is a key event for the creation of their movement. In case you missed it, Ferguson was a justified shooting and an embarrassing attempt by the media, progressives, and the usual celebrity hustlers to pull off a fraud. Despite the fact they got caught and the DOJ investigation under a black Attorney General appointed by a black U.S President found Brown‚Äôs constitutional rights were not violated, this fraud still persists. Guess who isn‚Äôt fazed by the shame of lying and will push the same scam as long as it still has utility? Ding ding ding‚Ä¶a hustler. Just within the past week the District Attorney for Ferguson reviewed the Michael Brown case for the past 5 months without any fanfare and concluded that there will be no prosecution of the former officer- .An important sidebar is that the District Attorney is black. So true, I agree totally! Why didn‚Äôt our black president do anything for the black community during his eight years in office. Sleepy Joe had the same eight years with Obama to make changes for the betterment of black and white relations. It saddens me they wasted those eight years and destroyed any advances made for race relations. You are so right that‚Äôs the exact thing I was telling my granddaughter today . That Obama did absolutely nothing for any one in the black community or anyone for that matter .. Hell in a hand basket is what the United States is headed for I‚Äôve been saying for years now ‚Ä¶ Wooossshh.. Good luck .. Just wondering what exactly could Obama have done for the community that you would agree was beneficial. He tried. The other officials denied him of doing so. He had his first four years unopposed with the house and senate in the hands of his liberal party and still couldn‚Äôt do anything aside from raise our taxes drive a rift between people and police that grew bigger and oh yeah increased our national debt twofold. He sure tried hard. Thank you for this fact-based and deeply thought out article. And I applaud you for your bravery to speak up when others tell you you‚Äôre ‚Äúselling out.‚Äù Yes, I am white and I‚Äôm a woman. But I‚Äôve lived long enough to see that the methods used by the BLM movement are well ‚Ä¶ dark. If these same tactics were use for a women‚Äôs movement I would speak out against it as well and state that they do not represent me. It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to figure out that this movement is not at all about encouraging equality, positive communication, and mutual respect for all. It‚Äôs not about understanding each other. It‚Äôs about violence and creating more barriers and hatred between people. Very scary time for us all when censorship of truth is rampant and wrong is disguised as right. The methods white people used to acquire this land, and develop this land, are dark. But now that you have the land you write laws and speak from a moral point of view to maintain your possessions. The looting represents me as a black man. I‚Äôm done with listrning to white people setting the stage for what is right and wrong when its convenient. The Trump administration is proposing legislation to raise religious and ‚Äúproperty over all other rights including life, so screw white laws. The burning and looting represents me as a black man from the Caribbean who knows that burning and rebelion was what forced England to declare slavery abolished. My generation will do the same, lay waste to this land and bring evil greedy people to their knees. You all are gonna meet a generation who would rather die than to continue to live this way and you‚Äôll have to kill them or give them a corona tuskeegee vaccine. The problem with wiping out all the back people is that whites will enslave each other again. You all need blacks and immigrants so bad. You all need to stop acting like people wouldn‚Äôt be outraged and demonstrating with all the racial injustice going on. Groups can try to hijack all they want, the movement is authentic and that‚Äôs what you all fear. Black lives matter didn‚Äôt start with George Floyd. It started with Trayvon Martin when kids walked out of class and took to the streets. I‚Äôve been numb since that incident and I still shed tears for that little boy who should still be here. But because the white man‚Äôs ‚Äúlaws‚Äù are convenient, we couldn‚Äôt get justice because the very righteous and good-willed people went state to state and lobbied rightious lawmakers to put stand your ground ‚Äúlaws‚Äù on the books and not surprising, gun owners know how it works and how to use it to the best of their ability. I wonder why those two in Georgia who chased the jogger and killed him pleaded not guilty??? We will lay waste to this land. Preach it! And spot on. When they try to hijack it and portray all peaceful protestors as ‚Äúthugs‚Äù then you know which side the bread is buttered. Your juvenile attempt to rationalize the looting, arson, and other criminal activity of the rioters indicates you have an underdeveloped or diseased mind. Your assertion that you and others like you will ‚Äúlay waste to this land‚Äù will end in your massacre. You are woefully unprepared for what you will reap should you try. I suspect you are just one more recliner revolutionary behind a keyboard. Are you? I would take your comment more seriously, if the burning and looting was not dis proportionally destroying black lives and minority owned businesses. You are demanding your reparations from your own backyard, essentially screwing yourselves and making your living conditions look like Baghdad 2005. I am white. I will not justify how the collective white race captured this land, but I will warn you that if you think laying waste to any American city is your version of reparations, it will not go well for you. Sadly, democrats will allow this sort of mayhem in their cities, perhaps they think that appeasing the mob is a winning strategy; however, if ever the looting and burning comes to the suburbs, it will not be tolerated nor rewarded. We already have had a Civil War, and a Civil Rights Movement. If you insist on repeating the past, you are truly a fool. I do not advocate violence because I do not think it will accomplish a better life for any person. I do not see the winning strategy in your proposal to violent revolution against whites. You have a hatred for whites, and that is fine with me, I do not care personally about your issues with white people, but I am advising you to reconsider outright violence against whites and expect a better life, let alone to live a long life. Ultimately, the best option is that like minded people of all races learn to live together for the cause of mutual prosperity and peace. That is why the Constitution, were it to be actualized, is the most just and well written documents of any society. We can go forward, or backward, but do not confuse what you call revolution as progress. It will cost more black lives than it will ever save, or benefit. If you advocate violence amongst your brethren, you are leading them into a life of violence, criminality and even early demise. Only a foolish person, or a hateful person would think in those terms. Which are you? The moment blm started to paint George Zimmerman as a ‚ÄúWhite-hispanic‚Äù is the day I saw it was a racially motivated hate group against whites. Don‚Äôt worry though, because extremist people like you is why gun sales have risen dramatically. You think all white America is like the urbanized liberal hippies who live among you, who are afraid of their own shadow. You are FAR wrong. Who do you think owns and works on all the farmland in America ? All we‚Äôd have to do is stop sending crops and meat to the cities and it would all be down in two weeks. Once the cities collapse, you won‚Äôt be receiving a welcoming or sympathizing person outside of city limits in your search for food and shelter. Cities are a ticking time bombing for humanity and only function because of people willing to work from the outside. Even if you found animals and forests, you don‚Äôt even know how to hunt, skin an animal, or harvest crops. Even better, you will have to trek acres upon hundreds of acres of land, while we are sitting with food in bellies and looking down the scopes of our steel. Contrary to popular belief, GPS and your phone wont be working if it comes to that. You are all mighty and powerful with this city thug talk, but we‚Äôll see how it comes when you are starving and begging for the police to come back. blm is the biggest joke I‚Äôve seen in my lifetime. Equality and respect is earned. You act like a human being, we can treat you as such. Republican or Democrat, if you support blm, you support terrorism. Hear, hear! The people running blm ARE the rich white people who wrote and passed those laws, who own the land, who own two and three houses, who passed NAFTA (and TPP if President Obama had had his way) who stole Operation Breadbasket from Rev Martin Luther King Jr,who passed the racist Superpredator Mandatory Minimum sentencing laws,who were trying to make Black Votes worthless by open borders‚Ä¶.The people funding blm have more white privilege money than all the middle class suburbanites in the whole country. The bad guys are running blm, foundations, universities and the Federal Reserve, not your neighbors. Hahaha . Look at africa, folks. They have more dictators, maniac killers and radicals like boko haram. And slavery is still flourishing in the land of black and done by black people themselves. Yes yes you‚Äôre absolutely right Blacks didn‚Äôt enslave each other after wiping out a village they didn‚Äôt kill all the men and then take the women and children as their own. Wait they did and they are still enslaving each other. Oh and certainly all those TVs and designer bags are really gonna help the movement looked more like someone was just taking advantage to go on a shopping spree for free while trying to take the moral high ground. The only white people that should be ashamed are the people who owned a slave and the Democrats who wanted to keep it that way and when they couldn‚Äôt instigated Jim Crowe laws segregation and win that fell through they created government assistance funds in order to keep you all quiet and pliant. Then they started telling the school system what they could and could not teach so that you wouldn‚Äôt learn of this and despise them for it. All of this can be found in almost any text book that is not printed here for a US class written by a Democrat. After all wouldn‚Äôt want to air that dirty laundry. Also stating you will lay waste to the land would mark you as a terrorist which means you yourself would be fair game to anyone who you harm. Tip might wanna stay out of Texas Arizona or any other states that have open carry permits. You guys won‚Äôt last long. But back when the Civil Rights Movement happened, MLK and majority of black people protested peacefully. Then he was killed and racism was still a big thing. So peaceful didn‚Äôt work did it. So now that we‚Äôre being more destructive y‚Äôall are like ‚ÄúOh please don‚Äôt destroy that Gucci store.‚Äù When we were peaceful you didn‚Äôt listen. So what do you want us to do. Sit back and be murdered? How about you actually get off your asses and actually start electing people that aren‚Äôt politicians. There is a reason that the Latin name for politics and politicians translates to blood sucking parasite. Clearly you are a white man pretending to be black, seen this type of nonsense before. Why do some people draw attention to the criminal histories of non-white people killed by police? One could be a convicted offender, but that does not mean police officers who are supposed to serve and protect the community can blatantly use excessive force that lead to the death of that person. That is the point did you and other white people do not understand. Conviction does that mean served time, let‚Äôs be clear. And he was never convicted or serve time in jail for armed robbery And he was never convicted or serve time in jail for armed robbery. this blog/post is feckless and you were in your feelings goodbye. Clearly you‚Äôve chosen to IGNORE the fact that before Floyd moved to MN, he‚Äôd spent 5 years in prison for armed robbery in TX. He‚Äôd already been in trouble with the law at least 3 times before he was in court with Judge Judy when he was 16 for pushing a woman to the ground, hijacking her car, and then wrecking it in a police chase: https://youtu.be/PncQCS4qLhs What Chauvin did was WRONG, without argument, and needs to be in court‚Ä¶.soon I hope. BUT, Floyd is not the ideal poster boy for black rights. Not sure why nobody seems to be mentioning the fact that George Floyd‚Äòs family didn‚Äôt give a damn about him either because of the kind of person he was but they weren‚Äôt very far from him because they themselves just came fake cried and used the opportunity to get a big payday on go fund me while even listing on go fund me that one of the main reasons for wanting donations was to fund his funeral AFTER they had already been told that the funeral was going to be covered by Mayweather while the family also made it seem like they couldn‚Äôt live without him even though they had no contact with him because he was a career criminal/drug addict. You can‚Äôt be serious. BLM is not a movement/group grown organically within the black community. BLM is not Dr. King‚Äôs Southern Christian Leadership Conference. BLM is not Malcolm X‚Äôs Organization of Afro-American Unity. BLM is an organization created and funded by Jewish billionaire globalist Soros. The ‚Äúblack leaders‚Äù of BLM were hand picked by wealthy white globalists, corporations and aging Marxists. NYC has had more shootings so far this year than in all of 2019. Think about that, more shootings this year than last year, and it‚Äôs only the second day of August. 99% of these shootings are black-on-black. One victim was a black one-year old baby boy. Shot by blacks. Still, BLM march through NYC and the rest of the country calling for the defunding and dismantling of the police. Black-on-black shootings is not an issue of concern for BLM. Neither is black education. BLM says nothing about campaigning to make academic achievement a priority in black families and the black community. No. BLM simply tells blacks that the reason you don‚Äôt do well in school is because of systemic racism. BLM says nothing about 80% of black babies being born out of wedlock. And we know the statistics about children raised in single family homes. They‚Äôre not good. BLM‚Äôs official mission statement calls for the disruption of the traditional nuclear family. BLM is the most anti-black organization since the KKK. And by the way, i hope you all know that the KKK was founded by the Democratic party in 1865 after the slaves were freed. The KKK/White Democrats lynched thousands of blacks and hundreds of white Republicans that were fighting for newly freed blacks civil rights and the right to vote. stop with the jewish billionaire right wing bullshit.You were axed from the conservative movement in the 1950s by William F Buckley Jr‚Ä¶when he cleaned up the john birch society‚Ä¶and your racist president Trump will be axed from power on election day‚Ä¶As for the jews there are 12 million jews in the world‚Ä¶.2 billion christians and 1.8 billion muslims‚Ä¶you do the math! Most billionaires are not jewish‚Ä¶and George Soros is a boogy man brought up only by the anti semitic right wing‚Ä¶too bad you are too ignorant to figure it out https://www.influencewatch.org/movement/black-lives-matter/ President Trump ain‚Äôt racist Oh here we go with the ‚Äúliberal Jewish‚Äù conspiracy crap. This anti Semitic trope is bogus and what find sad is you all don‚Äôt even change the verbiage from the QAnon site that you all copy and paste from. Just sad. Truth You do know that most Jewish people vote republican right? They just register as democrat. What led to these deaths was the inability for these men to comply with simple police instruction. That comes from poor parenting. And lack of Black fathers in the home!!! Children have been murdered (Black children) due to these riots. Davell Gardner junior, Secoriea Turner, do you want to compare your grief to their families grief??????? DO YOU EVEN CARE WHAT THEIR NAMES ARE??? Killing Black children while claiming to fight for Black lives??? When did the US police last open fire on innocent Black children? Like BLM have done!!! ‚Ä¶. The full video of Floyds arrest was edited. I wonder why??? Check out the full video (on DM) then tell me why it was edited?? TELL ME WHY IT WAS EDITED???? It‚Äôs pretty simple, Keith Ellison up charged the officers involved to second degree and aiding and abetting second degree all the while only having a preliminary autopsy report. He jumped on the case 4 days after the death of Floyd. He was taped saying that the public could never see the body cam footage because it would damage their case. Of course it would. It proved that his death had nothing to do with racist cops. They were more than lenient with him while he was spun out on drugs. It was only when Chauvin showed up that things got a little out of hand. The body cam videos and good attorneys for the 3 officers, not including Chauvin, and a ‚ÄúFair Jury‚Äù, should get those officers acquitted. Minneapolis will really burn if that happens. Just so you know, under the MPD Policy and Procedures handbook, 5-311, allows for the use of choke holds (lethal), and knee restraints (nonlethal), both unconscious and conscious techniques, up until 6/19/2020, just 14 days after Floyd‚Äôs death, when it becomes prohibited. Why do you think all black and other minority people should think alike? This article speaks the truth and the fact that you accuse the author of lying about their race proves that these organizations are unfortunately winning the war on the minds of Americans. The race talk needs to happen and is overdue, but BLM is not the vehicle for progress. They are a Marxist organization and nothing more. They are using and abusing the population that they have sworn to protect. Wake up. Over 100 million dollars has been donated to the BLM movement. The Open Society Foundation run by George Soros has donated some 33 million dollars. But what has that money been used for? How much has been used to repair and update public housing, which Mayor DeBlasio promised he would do. How much has been used to build new school buildings or pay for private schools so that the children in these impoverished areas can have an education equal to their peers in the suburbs? How about preschool and/or daycare for low-income families so the parents can find work? Or what about providing education to the parents, so they can compete in the job market for higher-paying jobs? All of these things would help to support any and all families living in poverty and move them toward independence. However, independence is not what this movement is promoting. If that were true, they would not have burned down the businesses of fellow black Americans or immigrants that are working hard to achieve the American dream. BLM promotes violence. Try and speak reasonably with anyone involved in the movement and you are immediately shut down. Donations to BLM are going to support Democratic politicians. Once in power, they will throw black Americans aside and completely forget all of their promises. I pray that we stop dividing our country with this propaganda. America is a beautiful country. Together, we can help her to grow and prosper. United we stand. Divided we fall. the allegation that george soros and other corporatists are behind the BLM movement is typical right wing propaganda used to discredit the change that is coming fast to the US‚Ä¶Those of you who buy into this nonsense are taking the bait that Fox news opinion hosts are peddling. Simply because an African American authors an article that challenges BLM gets you all excited while around the nation both whites and blacks have had enough of systemic racism and enough of police brutality against the minority community‚Ä¶You can deny deny deny all you want‚Ä¶.It isn‚Äôt going to change the reality and it isn‚Äôt doing to stop this from becoming a minority majority nation‚Ä¶.period Thank You for you honesty and truths‚Ä¶ backed by facts‚Ä¶.cant dispute that. What was done to George Ford was horrendous. That does need to be addressed and will be in a court of law. What I question is‚Äù Do sports players realize BLM is a militant organization that will use guns or whatever to arm their ‚ÄúPeace Officers‚Äù once they replace the police. BLM are not here to help blacks shootings blacks. The BLM used to be called Black Panthers- That name put fear in people as should BLM. I am not saying Black lives don‚Äôt matter, ALLL lives matter!!! Violence is never the answer. I loved that Malcolm X quote. Um.,clearly you have little understanding of Malcome X: ‚ÄúThe white man pays Reverend Martin Luther King, subsidises Reverend Martin Luther King, so that Reverend Martin Luther King can continue to teach the negroes to be defenceless. That‚Äôs what you mean by non-violent: be defenceless. Be defenceless in the face of one of the most cruel beasts that has ever taken a people into captivity. That‚Äôs just the American white man,‚Äù Malcolm X said. Oh, and the Black Panther were started as a response to Malcome X‚Äôs assassination. Nice counter allegations but that is all they are. Where is your proof of systematic racism? I see and hear nothing but hysterical allegations with not proof trying to insight mass criminal behavior by ignorant children. So if I donate money to BLM is it going to help the weapons of ‚Äúpeace police‚Äù to buy GUNS??? or does it go to blacks that need ? education classes- books on how to act when approached by a cop. What amount of money would help??? It goes to their own coffers as well as the left wingers backing the group. They don‚Äôt actually use the money for anything that they destroy nor do they attempt to build anything either. You must be a devout communist to say that he does not speak the truth. Or perhaps a follower of Hitler who used similar tactics to take over Germany in the 30s. Socialism is a disease worse than covid 19. The blacks have been hood winked since the liberals pushed welfare on them. Tell me one thing good that BLM has done for the Black community. Shootings are on the rise in all the Liberal run cities. The money collected from corporations is going to the democratic candidates that are on the far left. The blacks have been hoodwinked since around 1676 when, the white plantation owners feared the kind of revolts and constant slaughter of white plantation owners in the West Indies, particularly Jamaica, created a white middle class from poor white folks to use as a buffer zone. Plantation owner, William Byrd, in a letter to a man named Lord Egmont, acknowledging‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhow important status over Africans was to European Virginians by saying that slavery, ‚Äúruin[s] the industry of our white people, who seing [sic] a rank of poor creatures below them, detest work for fear it shoud [sic] make them look like slaves.‚Äù89 Thus the fear of losing their gained status over other lower-class Virginians impacted, at least in Byrd‚Äôs eyes, the labor poor European Virginians were willing to perform. So when I hear all this talk about get educated and improve schools, it‚Äôs because you all know that if blacks don‚Äôt work many if you white people will have to do slave work again‚Ä¶ Hence we see white people today supporting Trump because he plans to make the immigrants and poor so the work in a time the white man realizes, he too is a slave to the system. Don‚Äôt worry about blacks, we‚Äôll figure this shit out amidst all y‚Äôall distracting rhetoric. You do realize that the illegal immigrants are already doing that work for less pay then you or I would right? Also wasn‚Äôt born with a silver spoon in my mouth either but I work damn hard for my money and it‚Äôs not a thankful job either. Also if blacks don‚Äôt work you just feed the Democrats with votes who like that because they can increase taxes and add it to the funds to give people who don‚Äôt work a place to live and free money and food. Which means we all would be paying for you to live for free. I‚Äôm all for having a right to protest, but cant we have a fenced in area or an arena, where people going in have to leave their drivers licenses, and please bring cell phones and take many pictures so we can match you up with your crimes. 3 million dollars done to stores in Cleveland. Even destroyed black owners places. The government can only pay out so much to fix what THUGS are doing. Guess who pays the rest‚Ä¶we do with our taxes etc.. BLM are not your friend or savior. They will not be happy till they rule the world. What would Martin Luther King say about all this violence. Violence begets more violence. BLM is a radical militant organization, they will use guns and weapons on their ‚ÄúPEACE POLICE‚Äù. Peaceful protest are not part of BLM‚Ä¶They will destroy America from the inside, forget about nuclear weapons. I am for equality, get rid of the bad apple police. BLM/Black Panthers are not concerned with Blacks killing Blacks, they just made a bigger racial divide and hence more crazy killings. Guns flying in all directions‚Ä¶sooooo sad. We were making a difference. We Had Obama for president!!!! Labrane James worked hard every day of his life to get where he is, Oprha with her school in Africa is making a difference. BLM is about getting rid of authority in this county so they can control us with communist ideas. People get killed in China and disappear for just stating their opinion. We Americans‚Ä¶. ALL of us matter!!! America is a great place to live. If you dont like it leave‚Ä¶see it that works out for you? And you can deny, BLM are destroying businesses. Destroying properties destroying lives. Destroying acceptance of one another. You can believe that this is all on the up and up. So deny, deny, deny How about minority brutality against cops and other minorities? The truth hurts, stop cryin‚Äô Ok, Commie. Great article! I had That thought a while, back got shot down every time I tried to speak up. Even got chased down the hall at work when I tried to say nothing. What is happening now is a left movement, that has nothing to do with how black people are treated. but so much more on dividing as people. Wow, just wow. If someone tells the truth, they‚Äôre racist. This article is the truth. You know, something based on facts and evidence. Something we no longer get from liberals or 90% of news coverage. It‚Äôs an amazing concept, all of the BLM supporters screaming ‚Äúequal‚Äù rights, while having no problem with all black magazines, tv shows, colleges, businesses, scholarships‚Ä¶on and on. How is using the term ‚Äúmy people‚Äù of only blacks acceptance and tolerance? How is blaming all whites for something most of us never participated in, never witnessed, never supported, any different than white people who view all blacks as criminals. It‚Äôs all B.S., it‚Äôs all hate and intolerance. You live in this country and benefit from it‚Äôs prosperity, you are equally responsible for the history that got us here. Serve someone else‚Äôs agenda for a change, help others like they have helped you, do something to better society for our kids. Wow! This article hit the nail on the head and then some! Thank you for a breath of fresh air in the midst of a very distorted and extremely left leaning world of journalism. I admire you for speaking such blatant truth. Thank you for the truth! Good point about the Irish slaves. I would ask you to read up on the interracial revolt by black slaves, white pesants, and white indentured slaves, Irish and other Europeans that took place around 1676. Because plantation owners in Virginia feared the kind of uprisings that was taking place in the Caribbean, they gave those white pesants social class status over the blacks. There has not been an interracial revolt since because those whites have been used as a buffer zone between the plantation owners and the blacks. (Segregation laws peanage, interracial marriage codes, etc, further enhanced the divide down the road). Those whites have since fought to maintain their social status out of fear for doing slave work again‚Ä¶ Brown v. Board of Education, women‚Äôs liberation, civil rights act and the changes of that era weakened the white middle classes grip on social status (more available labor and opening up of opportunities drives down wages). Perhaps since the 1980s, it has been most evident that those folk‚Äôs social status has been threatened by the influx of skilled legal immigrants and undocumented immigrants (skilled and unskilled) that has further driven down wages the plantation owners have to pay. Labor unions were broken during this time. These immigrants, since the 80s, have done very well for themselves. So when Trump says make America great again we all know why white Americans who haven‚Äôt voted since Regan came out in droves. Let us call it what it is. Y‚Äôall are scared shitless. Plantation owners and the buffer zone. Deep down, the white middle class knows they are a pawn of the white plantation owners but because they see color and kind, and fear history repeating itself, it‚Äôs easier to turn on the black than to fight the real opressors. You only fight/demonstrate when a Walmart/big business comes to drive out your mom and pop businesses that help to hold up your social status. This isn‚Äôt true for all white people btw. There are many Oklahoma bombing type white freedom fighters out there, they just don‚Äôt come on social media and run their mouth. Likewise, the plantation owners used runaway slaves/black malitias to keep the plantation slaves at bay and quash rebelions in the Caribbean. There are black Americans who support Trump because they feel a set of foreigners shouldn‚Äôt come to America and move up in social status so quickly when their ancestors have been here over 400 years‚Ä¶ We are all puppets of one master. However, Black people, who have suffered the most, are being awoken by the spirits of millions of dead ancestors irregardless of whatever group that wants to hop on the coat tail of BLM and try to make it their agenda. We will learn, retain and speak our African tounge and we will beat our drums and summon our ancestors who will hear us and guide us. Marcus Garvey had the right idea. Repartuation. Africa for Africans. If immigrants stopped coming and blacks repatriated to Africa y‚Äôall would chase us like Pharo chased Moses and the Hebrews across the red sea to come back and work because y‚Äôall would become slaves again, or loose social status at a minimum. All that dormant white on white history would bubble to the top. Hey there, dumbshit. Did you know that, whenever you dribble on like that, w/ a false yarn about our presumed fears of having to work again. . . .that you are revealing your utter ignorance and also slapping quadzillions of New England farmers in the face ? That‚Äôs right. . . .My own ancestors were loggers and farmers in Northern New England, and they did all their own work, right from the get-go, after surviving the not-so-fun journey from Scandinavia. They worked their hands to the bone without ever employing YOUR pompous ass, and they were proud to achieve it as such. Not only that, but all.. . . ALL of the northern New England states . . . . participated in fighting in the Civil War, to free your ungrateful hide, when they did not even have to : Vermont, for instance, was one of the first states to enact anti-slavery laws as the state was even being founded. The next time you wanna droll on with some kind of race-baiting diatribe concocted under decades of Socialist-run education, FEEL FREE to do a little research ahead of time and learn a thing or two about the diversity of the early Colonies and states, as accurately recorded, archived and available for anyone to peruse. I believe the majority thought of ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again‚Äù was about bringing home the jobs that the Democrats easily signed off on to being sent abroad. Manufacturing coming home. Having a country that could sustain itself instead of getting into unfair trade agreements. I don‚Äôt think 1 white person though ‚Äúyay, we might get a black for cheap! Score!‚Äù Quite the opposite. As time goes by with BLM it seems as a way to get paid without working. People are not worried about losing black workers because other cultures take pride in what they do so Hispanics, Asians, and Whites will gladly pick up your slack and not have to deal with the bs of blm. That‚Äôs where you got it twisted. In fact without people like you I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a much better plan! Nicely said! Thank you! According to the left and their followers who drink the kool aid blacks can‚Äôt be racist. This is a very written article. Thank you for sharing and for having the courage that so many journalist have now lacked. Almost every single person on this thread is trying to justify their racism.. This is called projection. It is a mechanism of the unconscious designed to raise your consciousness. You project onto others, the world what is your issue ‚Äì that which is your own problem which you won‚Äôt see. So your unconscious mind puts it on everything you see until you get it is you that is the problem. In this instance you are projecting that you are a racist. You have accused everyone on this thread as being racist. You don‚Äôt know the slightest thing about what any one on this thread has done in their lives or what they believe. Yet you see racists. An article filled with facts triggers your projections, your emotions. You put it on everyone else because you don‚Äôt have the courage to face your own racism, your own bigotry so you accuse everyone else. Nut up and face your own faults instead of labelling everyone else as the problem. BINGO! If anybody cannot say ALL lives matter, THAT person is the racist. ALL lives INCLUDES black lives. If you believe in the BLM, then you believe all others: yellow, red, brown and white are less than blacks. We‚Äôre all ONE! ‚Ä¶at least we‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be. Racism that anybody no matter their race, religion or country of origin can have an opportunity to see direct reward for their hard work. This is why people come from all over the world to this country to live this life. That is the racism (sic) that America offers. Even you ? The funny thing is, you have no argument other than accusing others of systemic racism. When cited evidence is presented, you proceed to call out racism. I for one will stand against the BLM oppression of the black community. AMEN! I must add : BLM oppression (harrasment) to ALL races sommunity Yeah people tend to justify racism with huge explanations yet we all know that U.S is still criticizing the black kind. As they did to Mr Lindani Myeni the RSA Rugby player in 2021 recently!! The majority of the people here are white republican men, trying to justify their racism. Im sorry you are all so ignorant. You will never win. I‚Äôm an Australian, living in Australia. Don‚Äôt like either political party. There, here, where ever. I just seek to know backgrounds and history. The people running the show. What‚Äôs the background. Whats their history? I‚Äôm an observer, and impartial, but from where I stand, and what I‚Äôm seeing. I‚Äôm not liking the links to people in Thousand Currents board in previous M19 terrorist gang. The fully trained Marxists, and push for socialism, and the raised funds for black lives, going to white political campaigns, and not to black people or black projects. Riddle me that. I hold all life dear, no matter the colour of skin. really who are you then, What would you know about that? It‚Äôs not a competition but a totalitarian government means military police who can put you in a cell because they don‚Äôt like you or just kill you. So keep voting democrat if that‚Äôs what you want. The Republican Party emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act and the expansion of slavery into American territories. This is one great article. You know why? It‚Äôs the truth. BLM and Antifa are both communist inspired. If you go to The Communist Party USA website you will find the recipe the BLM mobs are using to orchestrate these so-called protests, which are anything but peaceful. I‚Äôve seen this before. I was just out of High School when the Black Panthers; again, a communist directed movement used to intimidate Black people into following the communist line. Eldridge Cleaver turned on the CPUSA after finding out communism was a lie. He said the communists were the ones running the Panthers, and it was the Panthers who were targeting Black businesses, Black neighborhoods, and it was they who were behind the violence during the riots in 1968. Cleaver jumped bail following his arrest, and fled to Cuba. He then began his great tour of most of the communist countries, stating with Russia and finally ended his tour after he visited to Algeria. He became totally disillusioned with the communist system. He said in every communist country he saw communism was a failure. Eldridge Cleaver finally gave himself up to the Police. He stated while incarcerated and was sent to prison. : ‚Äù would rather be in prison in the United States, than free in any communist country. So he did his time and after he was released, he met Professor W. Cleon Skousen, Former FBI Agent, Police Chief of Salt Lake City for a period of time, a Professor at BYU, and Founder of the Freeman Institute. Dr. Skousen took Eldridge Cleaver under his wing where he took classes at the Freeman Institute on our Constitution, the History of the Founding Fathers and their ‚ÄúFreedom Formula.‚Äù After Cleaver finished his classes, he was a speaker for the Freeman Institute. In his speeches the first thing he said was: ‚ÄúIf I had taken these classes when I was young, I would have never become a communist.‚Äù It is said: ‚ÄúEverything has it‚Äôs opposites.‚Äù Communism and the pain and death which accompanies its‚Äô existence, is the antithesis and polar opposite of thew Founder‚Äôs Freedom Formula. Our problems today are caused by the powerful, wealthy and greedy men, who Mr. Taha mentions in his article. Saying what Mr. Taha has said about these leftist organizations and the people who pull the strings behind the scenes of the riots and violence is dead on accurate. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to speak out against communist led groups because of huge amount of the power the men at the top who orchestrate and finance their front groups. These people are not millionaires. They are multi-Billionaires and Trillionaires, with unlimited funds, power and influence, which most people would believe could never exist. It is easy for people who don‚Äôt want to hear the truth; or those who want to suppress it; to ridicule the messenger and the message. But those who have refused to hear the truth about tyrants, have historically paid the price with their own blood. The best way to learn the truth is listen, prove or disprove what is being said and then evaluate the sources of the message. Don‚Äôt just sit down at a computer and make negative comments and personal attacks on the message and the messenger just because your biases and prejudices tell you to do it. Investigate, evaluate, and then make an educated conclusion about what is happening. You may find out that the unblemished sources you believe are true, are really luring people in a very dangerous direction. RIGHT ON! I agree and most of the newspapers are in their pockets. Thank god there are still many honest journalists out here! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! But what alternatives do we have? If you‚Äôre anti Antifa, then in short you are saying you are pro-fascist, and to me that is definitely anti-American! People seem to forget that 70 years ago we fought a war against fascism (my uncle was among their many African American veterans). If you are against Black Lives Matter, then you are in short saying that Black Lives (DON‚ÄôT) matter and that you‚Äôre on the side of the extreme right, white FASCISTS who have fucked over our country since day 1!!! Shame on any Black person who agrees with this article. Sell Out much???? As Eldrige Cleaver said, either you‚Äôre part of the solution or you‚Äôre part of the problem‚Ä¶and being against BLM is a huge ‚Äòpart of the problem‚Äô because you simply don‚Äôt get it!!!! Kinda sad that you call your fellow African Americans ‚Äúsell outs‚Äùfor appreciating the well writen article, I‚Äôm a white female and I really appreciate this article, it says a lot of things I wouldn‚Äôt dream of saying from fear of being labelled racist.. I would never dream of calling fellow white people sell outs.. that‚Äôs just encouraging more of a division.. you call for equality yet you section yourself off from the white community and call fellow black folks sell outs for not standing by blm and it‚Äôs agenda.. you either want equality or division.. you can‚Äôt have both.. I think you need to evaluate what you actually stand, and what full shit you spit out.. disagreeing with black lives matter is not saying black lives don‚Äôt matter at all.. just that there‚Äôs better ways to go about things than excepting the lies behind blm. Antifa is a misnomer. It is the most fascist group in America. They only believe in free speech if it is the speech they want to hear. Yes because causing billions in destruction to other black people really shows that they matter. Please tell us how it is on your planet because if that‚Äôs your standard for black lives I don‚Äôt wanna know what your standard is for anyone else. Great article. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for us to see how manipulated we have been but the truth will set you free. I agree with you. I am not for the knee on the neck but I do understand how the media has a certain narrative its runs. They ‚Äòprogram‚Äô you. We need to all stop watching Mainstream media. They lie about everything ur a clown, or a sellout. god bless you and your habitual ignorance. You‚Äôre hate is disgusting You put down and use hate to push your racist and communist propaganda under the guise of acceptance. We‚Äôre fed up with the Bs from people that are loud, obnoxious, and ignorant! So Democrats and the snow flake millennials who cry when they get their feelings hurt? Quick question: WHY would you read from the same FBI report that depicts white on white crime stats to be identical to Black on Black crime stats, and decide to leave that part out? I was with you until you did that, that only identified you as possibly another self hating, and white loving broken Black person. Understandable though, the techniques to break Black slaves have a generational effects sadly. You are just as bad as BLM you both have an agenda that has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR BLACK EQUALITY! Good arguments about blm influencers. However, you lost me when you started to talk about Georg e Floyd‚Äôs criminal past (R.I.P George Floyd). I‚Äôll remind you that Nelson Mandela was deemed a terrorist. We aren‚Äôt surprised our movement is being hijacked. It doesn‚Äôt matter, we would protest anyway. All this let‚Äôs forget and move along is an agenda in and of itself. In 1739 British Governor, Sir Alexander Lindsay, Earl of Balcarres, signed a treaty to give 1,500-2,500 acres of land to runaway (black) slaves who were ‚Äúterrorizing the price of sugar‚Äù to put it briefly. There is more to the story but the point is, you don‚Äôt get anything by being obedient and timid; we should have listened to Malcolm more. As a gentleman said I. A prior comment, our civil rights leaders of the past sold us out. The revolts we have today have the same effect if the revolt goes on long enough so there is always a plantation masters voice out here to get the slaves back in line so we can get back to tilling soil and forget any of this happened or is going on. The strong ones get broken, publicly shamed or exiled, like Dave Chapelle, Mohamed Ali, Collin Capernick, Nick Cannon‚Ä¶ Etc. Indeed a great article, thoughtfully presented and highlighting the truth. It‚Äôs about time a Brother came out to tell it like it is in order to educate, or at least attempt, the ignorance running wild throughout the nation. It‚Äôs been well known that black-on-black crime is and has been for too long, a serious problem in our communities and black neighborhoods in our inner cities. But for some reason, most likely by way of mass ignorance, and from those electing to turn their backs on the truth, refuse to address or acknowledge this fact. And you can underline (fact) ten times. They naively turn all attention on police killing Black people when the bigger problem is blacks killing other blacks. And this includes little kids. Even babies. (Do we hear about police killing infants and small children?) No! But for some nonsensical reason they don‚Äôt want to pursue or face that matter. Maybe it‚Äôs because they regard it as an insult to African Americans or at least that‚Äôs probably want the public to believe. Instead of facing the real problem, they choose to stage an ongoing war against law enforcement as if the police department are going about hunting down Black folks for sport. Contrary to the thinking of certain naive individuals, the police are the ones putting their lives on the line to try and solve these problems. Law enforcement are the ones facing these black-on-black crimes while a certain sector of ignorant individuals are at war with the police, the very people trying to help us. It becomes like a boxing match where one boxer believes the best chance of winning a fight is to lean into a punch thrown at him rather than block, dunk or side-step one. Its as silly as that! Its ridiculous. They make their own people look bad. Man, this country is really being taken apart. Things are becoming kooky in our society and as senseless as 2 + 2 equals 9, for the question remains, ‚ÄúWhy would any Black side with and vote Democrat, a party with a well known history of racism, slavery, backing the lynching of Blacks, burning them as well, and honored the terrorizing of Black folks from the voting polls when they were first given the right to vote? And meanwhile Blacks are killing other Blacks, a serious problem far greater than that of police shooting Blacks, some of whom were in the act of committing a major crime. No. They don‚Äôt want to hear about that. So they continue to be at war with law enforcement while ignoring the greater problems even though law enforcement are the ones they call when they want help for their own individual selves. Now George Floyd had a criminal record and was in the act of committing a crime. But clearly, Mr. Floyd did not deserve to be executed. It wasn‚Äôt that sort of crime. And the officer involved should have known better, especially when the man down was calling for help regarding an obvious medical problem. That officer should‚Äôve backed off and addressed the matter. But for some reason he did not. That‚Äôs beyond me because it only got that policeman in a lot of trouble. It seems clear that the Leftists Democrats think Blacks folks are stupid. They‚Äôre in the midst of staging a campaign to dupe our people in hopes that they believe the lie that that party has changed for the better and on the side of African Americans so they can receive more votes. They‚Äôre tearing down statues which can be easily be put back up, and enforcing a grand propaganda agenda not unlike that of the World War II NAZIs in an ongoing effort to fool other people just like Hitler and his gang did to the Jews when they lied to them, tricking them into undressing and go into a large room to shower when the shower was actually a gas chamber constructed for extermination. Clearly the guilty party in question ignited an agenda to wipe out an entire race of people. The people in those gas chambers were locked in and couldn‚Äôt get out, just like the Democrats wish to do to the poor souls if they elected them into power. Once they are in power, there would be no turning back when they show their true evil colors, not unlike the situation the Jews found themselves in upon entry into the gas chamber. After reviewing many Hitler documentaries it is clear the Democrats are conducting on their affairs remarkably like him. I swear. It is urged now to wake-up. Stop believing the lies on top of lies the media put out everyday in an attempt to fool the people; to hypnotized the populous exactly like that of the NAZIs during WW II. False, empty promises of a greater nation and better life. But in the end Germany was carpet bombed, invaded, and literally raped by a fraction of the Allies, (and you know who they were) all due to believing a lie and following a questionable leader without question. We are up against (the enemy within) who, on a very real basis are a threat to our way of life and the very existence of our beloved country. A country where many have given their precious lives for. In this country, when you take notice of a party who had the audacity to activate an impeachment process on a sitting president when clearly there were no grounds for impeachment, while at the same time blaming everything that goes wrong on the President, trying to fool the public that he is a racist and this same party supports illegal alien voting rights along with open borders, you know at that point there is something wrong here regarding that particular party. There comes a time in life when it becomes vital to wake-up. To investigate all matters closely and not foolishly accept everything your associates and the enemy within tells you largely by way of their ally the media. Remember: BLM at this point is not the answer for Black people. The ball has been hit into right field and they‚Äôre off in left field looking for it. Black people are better than that. The American people are better than that. Don‚Äôt be a fool like a certain power hungry party wants you to be. A party which supported slavery and one whose supporter performed the first assassination against Abraham Lincoln. That party hasn‚Äôt changed no more than they were back in the Civil War days. They merely want you to believe they changed by rhetoric and constant media propaganda not unlike that of Hitler‚Äôs propaganda minister in WW II. Now the Demos are back with a unique method and an agenda of trickery, and it appears to be working on a portion of the populous. The party thrives on people‚Äôs ignorance and will take advantage of such when they take notice on how ignorant some individuals can be. In NAZI Germany prior to WW II Adolf Hitler commented, some say it was Josef Goerbals, ‚ÄúIf you tell a big lie, and you tell that lie enough times, it would be believed‚Äù or words to that affect. Clearly, that statement came to true for NAZI Germany. Lets pray it doesn‚Äôt happen to this nation. ‚ÄîMay The Lord Bless our country. Agree bad behavior by police exists and should be rooted out, but believe most cops okay by far. They‚Äôve been dicks to me as well when I got pulled over. Have sassed them back on occasion, but honestly, I know when to quit! Majority of bad encounters with police happen when they feel threatened by your behavior or your openly defy their authority. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve been treated fairly? Take it up with the judge‚Ä¶LATER. Think you‚Äôve been ‚Äúprofiled‚Äù cuz you‚Äôre black? If you‚Äôre young male, most likely! Got a bad rep. It is PRESUMED you are packing, especially in a ‚Äúbad‚Äù area of town; less so if you in the suburbs. Not limited to white cops. Maybe more so by black cops even, cuz they think they know what‚Äôs up and may be even MORE suspicious. Bottom line, even if any preconceived ‚Äúracist‚Äù perceptions are present, all can change in seconds, depending on YOUR behavior. DO AS YOU‚ÄôRE TOLD! KNOW THE LAW. You‚Äôre not special. The FBI report lists only NUMBERS vs. percentages per race. Sure, the numbers may be identical, but consider that whites are 85% of the US population of 300,000,000. So, whites killing 2000 whites is hardly the same as blacks killing same number of their own, which represents only 15% of population. Why can‚Äôt you you people stop hating? It‚Äôs gross It‚Äôs mostly because despite the fact we have ‚Äùintelligence‚Äù we are still animals with emotions and instincts. It could also be the whole a person can be smart but a group of people are stupid. I am glad to read this rebuttal. I am sure he was well paid to write this to sow seeds of doubt and disbelief into the BLM movement. Full disclosure by him would br enlightening I‚Äôm sure. what about my ancestors that were sent to several countries for slave Labour (Look up home children) But of course they could not feel what it was like to be a slave. Even though they were sold for $4 apiece, indentured until they were 18. Lived alone with no family and no couture. Many of them were abused and died or became alcoholics This continued until the 1960s. But then they were only British and Irish children and white. Look it up! its all true. So why is it all about you???? HISTORY HAS NOT BEEN KIND BUT WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED Nothing really my ancestors were chased out of every country but this one and Israel. Not saying we are a race but hey semantics in that sense. We went and took back our own country it‚Äôs now known as Israel. So what we learned is that other countries and people will use you until you don‚Äôt let them anymore but that doesn‚Äôt mean go around burning shit down and being an all around nasty group and causing problems for everyone else. BLM started off great, they had a great mission and vision. Then the movement got hijacked. This is how it got hijacked by white liberals , hear me out. Who wanted to insult people of color by saying ‚ÄúI AM HERE TO SAVE YOU! YOU ARE 2 stupid to know this statue is a pain in your history but we white liberal women we gonna fight for you. Wait these are the Karen that call the cops on people of color omg this cycle is crazy.. ‚ÄúThe white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful/more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the negro‚Äôs friend and benefactor. By winning the friendship and support of the negro the white liberal is able to use the negro as a pawn or a weapon in this political football game that is constantly being waged between the negro and the white conservative. The American negro is nothing but a political football and the white liberals control this ball through tricks or tokenism, false promises of integration and civil rights. In this game of deceiving the American negro the white liberals have complete cooperation of the negro civil rights leaders who sell our people out for a few crumbs or token gains.‚Äù Malcolm X 1963 Voices like yours are being actively censored by the Deep State and Big Tech. Who is behind this massive propaganda movement? They must know there will be consequences that could destroy our country. I cannot imagine they are patriots. Yeah I wish Leslie wouldn‚Äôt have brought up the past crimes of GF. It ‚Äúalmost‚Äù brings a smudge of discredit to his point. But nontheless, great article. Since his death and subsequent riots/protests, I‚Äôve been stressed out big time about where I stand as a white person. Is there really this ‚Äúwhite guilt‚Äù, am I ‚Äúprivelaged‚Äù, is the BLM movement justified. I‚Äôve come to a conclusion at least about the BLM movement. It is an insult to black people. Black people share just as much success and significance as everyone else, especially today in 2020. This BLM business clearly has an agenda. It‚Äôs becoming more and more obvious to me. It‚Äôs sad however that apparently so many others are being fooled. I pray that reality would set in and be displayed just as loudly as the garbage fake news. But that seems unlikely. Man some of you guys are really blind. Did you all not watch the same video of George Floyd that I did? Not only that, but are you seriously going to act like this is something brand new? Mr. Floyd was not the first black, white, or other person in this country that has fallen victim to police brutality. And bringing his prior drug use and criminal record by no means justifies the way he was executed. It‚Äôs crystal clear that excessive use of force by police against people of ANY color is an issue in this country that needs to be addressed. For those of you who regurgitate the simple minded narrative ‚Äúwhat about black on black crime‚Äù white people are overwhelmingly responsible for the murder of other white people by the numbers because people kill people generally based on proximity. Do yourselves a favor and actually use your brain, do some unbiased research, and remain open minded about the way this country has been set up for black people to not prosper in many situations. Hey man, what do you mean bringing Mr. Floyd‚Äôs past drug and criminal record doesn‚Äôt justify any execution? Why hide that fact? Why are you making a martyr out of a man with a criminal record like it‚Äôs Martin Luther King, Jr. or something. One who scuffled with police rather than cooperate and most likely brought on a medical issue he already had because he elected to commit a crime. An individual who chose a criminal life, making Black folks look bad. Like he was some kind of a role model for up and coming young Black boys and girls to look up to. Like we‚Äôre dealing with the Honorable Frederick Douglass, an ex-slave who was unjustly beaten and whipped for no fault of his own and who self educated himself and displayed courage to escaped slavery and become an abolitionist, a reformer, an author, an orator and advisor to presidents including Abraham Lincoln before, during and after the Civil War. Not an illegal drug user, thief or somebody with a police record. Did Douglass have a criminal record? No! He, Booker T. Washington and Dr. King sacrificed themselves and set a positive example for our people to follow. Sir, may I say that the ball was hit in right field and you‚Äôre off in left field looking for it. It is sad that George Floyd had to leave life like that, ultimately a victim of his own self; an attitude which led to his demise. But there is no excuse for an officer to remain holding his knee on the man while he mercifully cried for help from God and a cry for his mother even, while this officer did nothing about it as his fellow officers stood around as if making a joke of the hold thing. Mr. Floyd deserved another chance to clean-up his act just like anyone of us because in the eyes of the Lord we‚Äôre all tainted with sin. Just because we may not have that particular sin do not in the least mean we‚Äôre completely innocent of all matters. As far as ‚Äúrace‚Äù is concerned; God is not a respecter of persons. Please keep in mind that we are not just Black, White, Asians etc. but are individuals, and while being individuals we are responsible for our own actions and cannot rely on excuses to justify committing any wrong doing. And this goes for lawmen and women as well as law breakers. When a Black person has a matter with the police the media blows the whole thing up into major news. This signals crooked people to go out into the streets and burn buildings and loot businesses and break into shops and private cars and such. When Black folks are involved this behavior makes us look bad and dishonorable. If an individual is unjustly treated, two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. The question remains: Why make a martyr out of one with a criminal record? We‚Äôre not talking about Mandela or Dr. King here. We‚Äôre talking about individuals who sadly displayed a bad example for not only Black people but the entire populous in our nation. Speaking of bad examples, Colin Kaprenack comes to mind. If a policeman unjustly did something wrong, why blame the flag; the Stars and Stripes, the Government, the entire police department, the President or the nation? That logic makes no sense and is universally wrong. Why shun everything our nation stands for solely because one or two people executed a wrong doing? Playing the blame game causes more problems than it does in solving them. Why would any athlete, professional or otherwise disrespectfully take a knee to the National Anthem, the flag, a flag that gave this dude a rare opportunity to become a big time famous and honored football player and make a lot of money; far more than the average citizen? It‚Äôs like biting the hand that feds it while fellow players follow that sorry example and do likewise, while at the same time completely ignore black-on-black crime which greatly exceeds police shootings of Blacks. It‚Äôs giving the bird to the flag and the brave people who gave their lives for freedom and the vast opportunities this nation provides. How pathetic. Black Lives Matter is not the answer, but a part of the problem in this country. Why say Black lives matter and ignore the ongoing problem with innocent black folks including Black children and babies are shot by others with no respect for the law or even children? Finally, Black folks need to wake-up and address the fore mentioned matter because a messed-up attitude is running rampant in the Black community. When somebody mentioned that (all lives) matter he was booed off the stage until someone else shouted Black lives matter and received an applause, like (only) Black lives are of any importance while everything else don‚Äôt matter. And this cat came back and apologized to the audience. That‚Äôs some sorry stuff man. It‚Äôs pathetic. Stop paying homage to the Democratic Party, a party that supported Slavery and are currently trying to dupe Black people into voting for them so they can win an election and gain power. These particular Blacks are not just Uncle Toms but black (Benedict Arnolds), traitors not only to the nation but to their own people. ‚Ä¶May the Lord help this troubled nation. Amen The only way you are privileged is who you‚Äôre born to like the Clinton‚Äôs and the Kennedy‚Äôs or some other large family with old money and political clout. because I‚Äôm white and I have to work everyday to afford a shitty apartment and have to walk on eggshells around people because they have thin skin. Honestly though ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù used to be something now there is only really ‚Äúblack privilege‚Äù I mean I don‚Äôt know any other group that can walk around calling people whatever they want. Seriously I have been called a cracker, honkie, and other rather unflattering terms by my black coworkers. Yet when I bring it to my manager all I get is a get back to work and those are racial slurs. If I used the n word I would have been fired and arrested for a hate crime. I also don‚Äôt have any form of guaranteed placement for a job or spot in a college because of my skin tone. So yeah ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù dead ‚Äúblack privilege‚Äù alive and kicking. Also white guilt is rather foolish unless you are telling me you were alive way back then when slave traders were catching them and were one of them or owned a slave of their own then yes feel guilty but if you didn‚Äôt there should be no guilt. No one wants to talk about the ‚Äúelephant in the room‚Äù. The real motive is moving toward socialism where the central government controls everything and is always there to ‚Äúprotect you‚Äù. You can see the difference in our reaction to Covid-19 compared to other pandemics in the past that killed many more people that this one. Exactly! Black Lives Matter, all right‚Ä¶.except for the dominant, law-abiding, African-Americans (including conservative blacks..) Well it seems like ppl like you are blind once again you ppl want us to believe your doctors your puppets in the line of duty and the the system that has no good will toward Humanity . You sound just like the RACIST ppl who are trying to ignore the true reason behind the movement of the ppl . I could care less of the labels ppl are trying to relate with the message like BLM and that political stuff it‚Äôs just noise to distract divide but don‚Äôt lost focus on the reason everyone is standing up to people like you and the system and that‚Äôs because we are tired of people turning the other cheek acting like everything is okay after witnessing this brother died in police custody no matter the circumstances and your weak effort to tarnish his name after death to show the character that you have this man is dead RIP. George Floyd . You sir are a disgrace to journalism when you brought up that man‚Äôs past but all the different type of things that he was accused of and maybe convicted mean means nothing we are talkin about the fact this man died in police custody while the man was saying I can‚Äôt breathe let someone cut off your air supply if you have a heart condition you don‚Äôt fear for your life and have a heart attack what provoked the heart attack the lack of air the fear of your life so don‚Äôt try to find a loophole to to wash those dirty cops his hands and try to paint them as knights in shining armor because real police officers would have handled him put them in the back seat of the car within minutes but these were not real police officers they were cowards what was the purpose of keeping a man on the ground for over seven and a half minutes while in handcuffs? I want to say your not here to bring change you just want to justify a murder. So I ask you is a man life worth 20$ in you book seems like that a yes . Due to you lack of punctuation I can see why the article went right over your head. You didn‚Äôt debunk anything he said with fact when most of what he said was factual. I don‚Äôt know a single person, black OR white, who has even attempted to justify GF murder? execution? So, do not understand your attempt to paint the author as some type of sellout. Just because he exposes BLM as something other than what it is marketing itself as, does not mean he in any way condoning police misbehavior. Thank you for an intelligent and introspective analysis of the Black Lives Matter.com in relation to what is really happening in our society. As you indicated, the media just slants the information out of proportion so the lazy people who don‚Äôt bother to look farther into the issue(s) just flat out believe them. Thank you for speaking the truth,finally a journalist with backbone. I am very thankful that I read this article. Thank You. Members of my own family, who are white, have embraced the Black Lives Matter movement with ferocity. When you try to have a conversation about the organization and their agenda, their response is ‚ÄúYou are either with us or against us‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt agree with everything, you are a racist. End of conversation. I have even been told that having black family and friends doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I am a racist. I personally found that offensive because to me they are just friends and family, not my Black friends and family. I was taught, and try to live by, the golden rule of treating others how you want to be treated. There are not buts, or, unless they are a different color, clauses. I am very afraid of the direction our country is taking and the steam roller affect it is having on corporations, government and lawmakers, but have no idea how to speak out. Articles like this help to clarify my thoughts and give direction. If there are any suggestions, please let me know. Again, Thank You People. I NEVER thought black lives DIDN‚ÄôT matter. I‚Äôm sorry but anyone who tells you with or against, is‚Ä¶.most likely scared of mobs coming to thier door (superficial, shallow, and ignorant came to mind too). Everyone needs to stand up against the this ignorance. And, there no erasing history‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no such thing as an erase-erase. I suggest protests be taken to the doorsteps of the media outlets. Demand answers, badger them for why, what. Question them, and don‚Äôt believe em farther than you can throw them. I mean, only YOU can give your freedom of mind away, no one can take it from you, even if they tell you you‚Äôre wrong. Again, argue with them until they get pissed for your questioning, make them tell you ‚Äúno‚Äù, then demand more answers. ‚Ä¶. Some other things I‚Äôve noticed (my perspective): This that is going on is childish, dumb, and a CLEAR WARNING SIGN that people have been giving up the independence of thier minds. Its the ‚Äúcool‚Äù syndrome; everyone wants to be popular, accepted, liked, to fit in. Lotsa people with thier ‚Äúcool‚Äù portable computer/reciever/transmitter, getting all the ‚Äúcool‚Äù information from the ‚Äúcool‚Äù sources. Now you have to be somewhat braindead to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù. Funny, its going down in history, that these ‚Äúgroups and establishments and mobs‚Äù, are trying to destroy historical‚Ä¶anything. I wonder why no one is learning from this, as history of any kind is there to remind of what to do and what is really bad idea. .. As well, some of the people in this country are going through an identity crisis. Sorry folks, there‚Äôs no getting rid of the old ugly wife and busted car for a younger newer model of car and wife. Doesn‚Äôt work that way when it comes to events and facts. This isn‚Äôt about (an ethnicity)lives mattering, or about police brutality, or even about politics. This is about poverty and ignorance. We the people (as a majority it seems) really don‚Äôt know how good we have it here. The lights turn on, the water runs and is mostly drinkable. We don‚Äôt have a gestapo (or the thought police, though these adolecent activist mobs are trying to make it so). So far there‚Äôs been gas at the pumps, and we have a huge variety of goods and services to choose from. There aren‚Äôt any criminal organizations running strong-arm racketeering with threats and violence (heh, sound like the angry threatening mob again). Go to other countries, you probably don‚Äôt want to drink the water, you‚Äôre lucky if the lights go on at all, you can‚Äôt speak your mind around the secret police because they might ‚Äúsend you away‚Äù against your will, goods and services are limited or non-existent, and the pumps have gas only half the time (some countries you have to go buy cans of fuel from the guy in the van in the alley). Mafias and cartels rule the trades and goods, and they will make people disappear for looking at them sideways. As well, what we here consider non criminal or ticketable is considered capital crimes in other countries (you‚Äôll be lucky if you get anybody to speak for you, some places wont allow the accused to speak) . So, I can‚Äôt shout so loud that the whole world hears me, but if you‚Äôre reading this (who ever you are), start showing your brain. In fact, if people start getting serious and angry, start laughing at them and/or make them the joke of the day. Sure they‚Äôll get more pissed, STAND UP TO THEM. And make some more jokes. Make a silly pinched angry face at them. No this is not a nice thing, and no its kinda a dirty job. But I see that we‚Äôve gotten here by‚Ä¶trying to be too nice and sesitive; defering to someone else for right or wrong; blaming anything on anyone but the INDIVIDUAL placing the blame; kids who had kids, who had a kid who is raising a kid (poor or non-existent parenting); Don‚Äôt be the group as an individual person with a heart and mind of thier own, that no one can take control over. Take action, speak up, even if you stand out. Its ok, those angry people over there threatening you to think like they do or else, should be questioned face to face as an individual, and THEY say alot of things. Maybe the next march/protest I should hand out copies of farenheit 451. Why do I have to be the only one doing it? If we as individuals do nothing and stay silent while mob mentalities ruin everything, then it really IS OUR OWN COMPLACENT FAULT FOR LOSING EVERYTHING. DON‚ÄôT BE SILENT. YOUR LIFE MATTERS. wow! been waiting along time to see someone with the nerve to call it like it is! These come lately movements are the signs of the times we live in and we can thank our liberal colleges, media, etc. Will main stream folks of all colors wake up? Guess socialism, communism and totalitarian rule does not scare these so called cool enlightened folks. Do we have to lose it all before we realize why people are trying to get into our country? Will it be worth coming for? Will we save this country before it all goes down? 71 years old and remembering a much better land where a black man can get elected president twice. What led to that? We must have created something good since Martin Luther King was murdered. Things were coming along with all kinds of trouble along the way but changes were being made. We now see a new division taking place thanks to these new anarchist movements. Insanity on a grand scale? Lets get back to mutual respect for one another and allow freedom of speech to return in every situation. This is my 1st reply to any article, feels good! The Democrats in Black Lives Matter have taken pages out of Stalin and Hitler‚Äôs book on how to run a country. This is the same shit they did when they took over. Cancel culture is Nazi culture. They will drown out and brow beat or physically beat you down until you agree with them and if you don‚Äôt they eliminate you. That is what this group and the Democrats are. Leslie ‚Äì Thank you very much for writing this article and also for providing links for the facts. I listen to Larry Elder regularly and so appreciate the time, effort and tireless work that goes into standing up against the insanity that is going on and for providing a voice of reason. It is unbelievable to me how many people just seem to follow the regular media and think they are getting real news. Thank you and God Bless You!! Sincerely, MEB, Los Angeles CA I do believe we have billionaires behind many of these movements that are trying to make us a socialist nation. The saddest part is that the protesters and the media are being ‚Äúused.‚Äù Lenin, in his conquest by the Bolshevik revolution, thanked all of the people who helped him achieve his dream, by calling them the ‚Äúidiots‚Äù. Make no mistake about it, the protesters and the ever willing media better hope this dream is not achieved. If it is, they‚Äôll be the first lined up against a wall and shot. The socialists will have already hand picked who the media will be and will not trust who‚Äôs in place now. The protesters right along with them. Why? Because they might foment another revolution. To hell with blm what a b‚Äôs movement. The drive by media eats crap cause you can tell by the crap that comes out of their mouths. Just like yesterday in Detroit when Littleton fired a gun at cops. As soon as the footage was shown on tv the story disappeared. The government thinks we are stupid it‚Äôs the other way around they are stupid CNN is the worst. President Trump will mop the floor with all media and he will win by a landslide. All the tricks and fauls witch hunts everyone sees. I‚Äôm a deplorable and there are millions that share my view. So step off BLM no agenda for workforce development / CTE Career Technical Education why are they paying people to be activist. Our young people need career development. Why are these billionaire and corporation paying youth to be activist. Reverend Sullivan had the right plan!!!!! OIC Why not fund these organiztion!!! they still exist!!! Why they do not fund CDC community development corporation. (housing/jobs, economic development.) What wrong funding HBCU!!!!! BS Good arguments about blm influencers. However, you lost me when you started to talk about Georg e Floyd‚Äôs criminal past (R.I.P George Floyd). I‚Äôll remind you that Nelson Mandela was deemed a terrorist. We aren‚Äôt surprised our movement is being hijacked. It doesn‚Äôt matter, we would protest anyway. All this let‚Äôs forget and move along is an agenda in and of itself. In 1739 British Governor, Sir Alexander Lindsay, Earl of Balcarres, signed a treaty to give 1,500-2,500 acres of land to runaway (black) slaves who were ‚Äúterrorizing the price of sugar‚Äù to put it briefly. There is more to the story but the point is, you don‚Äôt get anything by being obedient and timid; we should have listened to Malcolm more. As a gentleman said I. A prior comment, our civil rights leaders of the past sold us out. The revolts we have today have the same effect if the revolt goes on long enough so there is always a plantation masters voice out here to get the slaves back in line so we can get back to tilling soil and forget any of this happened or is going on. The strong ones get broken, publicly shamed or exiled, like Dave Chapelle, Mohamed Ali, Collin Capernick, Nick Cannon‚Ä¶ Etc. Malcolm X was killed by a member of his own organization, which, after his conversion to Islam, had affiliated with Muslim organizations, one of which leaders he disassociated himself. This falling out led to his murder, as he was believed to be softening his views on violence as an effective means of change. Got a steep hill to climb if you selling MLK as a sellout. Second point is not sure what your ‚Äúrevolt‚Äù is about and against what. Systemic racism is rather vague. If you could cite some specifics, like employment, housing, education, prosecutorial discrimination, would be helpful. Did Nelson Mandela ever point a loaded weapon at the belly of a pregnant woman? Didn‚Äôt think so. When are you ignoramuses going to have a riot for Secoriea Turner? Oh, right,‚Ä¶she was killed by BLM and can‚Äôt be used as a weaponized death as a result. My bad, continue to worship this crackhead. I was raised in NYC when Rudy Guliani was in charge & during 9/11/01. Never Forget is what they said, well.. they forgot. I moved to FL in 2010. I have always considered myself a democrat, until now. This 4th of July weekend has been one of the deadliest weekends ever in cities around the country. Shootings all weekend, several dead in NYC. A child shot by BLM protesters in GA is among the many killings. I am seeing the difference in the democratic run cities and am finally ‚Äúwoke‚Äù more than I have ever been. I now view myself conservative, will never vote Democrat again. I am also changing my party affiliation To Republican. I could never support this Violent ‚Äúmovement‚Äù. Anyone who can‚Äôt see the violence & continues to support BLM is either blind or stupid. If the Liberals win we will eventually be under a dictatorship & it will just keep getting worse. I hate everyone equally‚Ä¶ What? We‚Äôre all thinking it! We have all come across the worst of the worst in skins of every color! But we have also come across the best of best in skins of every color! Love & kindness are incurable diseases. Love & kindness spread faster than any ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù. They say knowledge is power; how is that possible when everyone on both sides know everything? Love is power. Kindness is power. Black. White. Brown. Red. Yellow‚Ä¶ We all have the power!! Hear hear! Sounds like almost every reasonable person who‚Äôs ever travelled. lol. There‚Äôs good and bad in ALL walks of life. ALL lives matter. Yeah, I said it. Come at me. You made very logical points. While I want equality for all, I just see anger and craziness through using the avenue BLM. Love and patience and facts make change, not anger, hate and violence. I love people of all color. I do not respect people of any color who resort to violence, hate and destruction of property. As a country we are being divided not united. I see more footage of public anger and violence between people, whether it be in a store setting, on the street or through social media, than I have seen in years. It doesn‚Äôt feel like progress it feels like we‚Äôre turning into a country of division and violence. Our country has always stood out because we stand for peacefulness and unity, while some other countries have struggled with grasping what we take for granted. Lets work together like we always have. Do our research not just watch the media and come up with logical solutions. History is repeating itself. Your critique of BLM applies to most of the prominent supposedly black grass roots organizations over the last one hundred plus years: NAACP founded 1909, Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE)-1942, South Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) ‚Äì 1957, Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) -1960, etc. There are videos of Malcolm X criticizing them for being controlled by whites. Is the KKK still around? Never hear anything about those dipshits. BLM gives all their money to demoRat politicians that have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help the black people.! They stick that money in their pocket and worry about what flavor ice cream they‚Äôre gonna eat that night. While BLM tries to give them more money. Y‚Äôall some stupid mfers! How do you not realize that they are using you??? BLM doesn‚Äôt give a crap about how many black people get killed EVERY DAY by other blacks. They can blame it on Trump all they want to, but bottom line is, the white DemoRATS are looking out for themselves and BLM is still sending money to those senile WHITE dipshitz! Damn, think for yourselves instead of how much money that you‚Äôre giving them to live in one of several homes they own (with security). It is time to clean out the communist dems and socialists rich from our country and bring our country back together for all its people no matter what color or race to live by the constitution of the United States, if it means a war to make it happen then so be it.. I have been a democrat since 1987 when I was first able to vote. In that time period I have voted for some republicans,but mostly democrats. Mind you I was raised to respect the Flag,our country, respect authority,make change through peaceful avenues that our constitution allows,put an honest days work in and you can achieve the American dream. I can happily say that I have attained the American dream by my standards. When the riots,looting and burning of cities occured I was angered as an American. When police were vilified for doing their job,I was disgusted. I am changing my party affiliation to republican and voting for President Trump. My wife is as well. As a democrat, I voted for Bill Clinton but when I saw he bragged about paying off the national debt and later discovered he had quietly transferred the debt to the Social Security trust and Federal Reserve. He left Social Security with a $3 trillion IOU that will never be replaced. What a liar. I‚Äôm thinking about leaving party. As I watched in shock President Clinton sign the Community Reinvestment Act, I knew such an irresponsible act would eventually cost us tax payers trillions once it fell apart. I had no idea just how extensive the damage would actually become to the economy and loss of jobs. Banks should never be forced to mortgage homes to people who can‚Äôt afford to make the payments, much less maintain the home. The Democrat party seemed to approve, so maybe I was missing something. I can‚Äôt continue to be affiliated with this party any longer. I was never owned by a party and always voted for the best person regardless of their affiliation but finally, after the Progressives took over and watching Al Gore‚Äôs temper tantrum on television when he lost to George Bush, plus the all the insanity of Pelosi, Schumer, Bird, Jackson, Kaine, Schiff, and Clintons, Reed, and so many others, I was forced to change parties. Even though no group of politicians are going to be perfect, the GOP has demonstrated superior leadership, ethics, responsibility, and trust, compared to the party of progressives, socialists, and communist. I‚Äôve obviously been on the right side of the law and politics for over 19 years now and every year I have been reassured that I made the right decision. The DEM‚Äôs have been spiraling out of control and living up to the Communist Manifesto for years and it‚Äôs time they dissolve before they open the gates to hell. Lmao you do realize that comment makes no sense about Clinton when it comes to debt. Nothing was quietly transferred. First Social Security isn‚Äôt in the general fund it has a separate account. It‚Äôs a pay as you go system and has always been. When money comes in it immediately goes out to the people drawing it. So there is no way it was transferred to SS. Now to the transfer to the federal reserve is kinda not correct either. What was moved to the Federal Government/Reserve was public debt. This is kinda one of the reasons the reserve exist. Basically the Clinton administration got the public debt down using the Bush tax increases and transferred the rest to the federal government. Like I said before the Gross federal debt never went down under Clinton. The GOP and Democratic party do the same junk. lol Surprisingly the KKK is still around but they mostly just stick to holding parties and the like. At least from what I can find on them online anyway. They might do a cross burning here and there on their own property for all we know but no lynchings or attacks on black families. After all they are already doing it to themselves no real need for the KKK to do anything. I‚Äôm happy to see that I‚Äôm not the only person who has this perception of this movement! I‚Äôm Caucasian and unfortunately any time I try to express my beliefs and opinions of what I see going on I get ‚Äù oh you just don‚Äôt understand because you are white‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ That phrase really burns me up to the point I finally decided to look for someone else who can see that the approach the movement is taking is only going to make things worse. That phrase is racist at face value. No more info needed after that. Would you continue to argue with a KKK member? As an African American male I 100% agree with this. The issue is the BLM mouth pieces are mainly uneducated and screaming women. We need men like this who use logic and facts. If we were to clean up our own communities you would see a very Sharpe drop in violence. Really? Blaming another demographic that experience discrimination? This is the problem, constant blaming and division like you just did, not women. What about the screaming men on the protests? FYI, they were majority. Another FYI, there‚Äôs another article with more data than this one written by a woman on The Guardian making the same points. Gender isn‚Äôt the problem, your attitude is. Who are the leaders of BLM champ? Who jumped on the stage and took Bernie Sanders mic? Who made the made one of BLM mission statement basically to be anti black nuclear family? Yeah a black man came up with ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need a father‚Äù No my attitude isn‚Äôt the problem here champ. You getting extreme trigger brain is the issue lol. lol, Your attitude is the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù because it encompasses FACTS that poke a huge hole in these people‚Äôs false narrative. I had to LOL a bit thinking about a black man saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need a father.‚Äù When is the world going to stop attacking the black male and giving some attention to the real cause of these issues? The victim mentality and Democratic kool aid given out in the schools and on the news shows? I‚Äôm pretty sure that is the problem right there and until people are taught to actually want to progress for themselves instead of wanting papa government to handle everything for them like a baby needing it‚Äôs diapers changed then nothings gonna happen. ‚ÄúWho are the leaders of BLM champ? Who jumped on the stage and took Bernie Sanders mic? Who made one of BLM mission statement basically to be anti black nuclear family? ‚Äù So what if some women did that, there are also just as many men that did that too. Why not just criticize people, regardless of gender, who are screaming and uneducated. As far as anti-Black nuclear family, if Black men were for the nuclear family, they wouldn‚Äôt be walking out on their kids at such high rates so obviously too many Black men think kids don‚Äôt need a father. Apparently you missed the cause of all of the social and cultural issues associated en masse with the black community. Who is raising all these children on their own? It isn‚Äôt black fathers raising these kids,‚Ä¶they left. Do you really think fathers generally leave because of their kids? And somehow the world thinks it‚Äôs THEIR fault these poor kids are going up the way they are. You asked who is raising all these Black kids on their own? The answer is not the father which is one reason why so many inner city Black kids are out of control. The fact that one is no longer with a child‚Äôs mother is not the reason men leave their kids, they walk out on their kids because they don‚Äôt want to take responsibility for them, own it Black men. Of course it is do as we say not as we do. White men across america raped black women the enslaved the children they sired. Amazing examples of parent responsibility! Out of 45 presidents one was black and out of a 400 year history only 60 are in the post civil rights era and white persist in blaming blacks for all that is wrong with America. Who is denying responsibility. Whites controlled the country from day one. You fucked up the soil, the water, and the air all for the dollar, a product of your imagination!

Twenty-eight-year-old Tshegofatso Pule was eight months pregnant. Mzikayise Malephane appeared in court and was charged with premeditated murder. After her death, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the culture of silence around gender-based violence had to end. Ms Pule went missing on 4 June and four days later a member of the public found her body in the Johannesburg suburb of Roodepoort. She was hanging from a tree and had been stabbed through the chest. There was a wave of outrage in South Africa after Ms Pule's death and the hashtag #JusticeForTshego trended on Twitter. Mr Malephane was arrested on Monday and appeared in court on Wednesday. In the short appearance he was not asked to plead, reports the newspaper The Sowetan. The case has been postponed until 24 June to allow him to get legal representation. The authorities have not revealed if he was known to the deceased. The police have appealed to the public to assist with the investigation - they suspect that more people were involved. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Johannesburg The past few days have been difficult for the women of South Africa. At a time when the nation's focus has been on containing the spread of coronavirus, the gruesome murders of women like Tshegofatso Pule have been a harsh reminder of the daily violence women face here. President Cyril Ramaphosa has described gender-based violence as the shame of the nation. His government has in the last few months channelled more resources towards the fight. Some of the extra funding has gone towards training the police, some towards special sexual offences courts. But advocates say there should be more focus placed on prevention and, for that, attitudes towards women need to change. That is something that will need more than hashtags and protests, it needs men to be part of the solution, they say. This video can not be played On Saturday President Ramaphosa released a statement denouncing gender-based violence. He said it had become more dangerous for women during South Africa's lockdown. ""We note with disgust that at a time when the country is facing the gravest of threats from the [coronavirus] pandemic, violent men are taking advantage of the eased restrictions on movement to attack women and children,"" he said Mr Ramaphosa condemned the brutality of recent killings, mentioning Ms Pule and two other victims: As many as 51% of women in South Africa had experienced violence at the hands of someone they were in a relationship with, the president's statement said. He urged people to report crimes. ""Gender-based violence thrives in a climate of silence. With our silence, by looking the other way because we believe it is a personal or family matter, we become complicit in this most insidious of crimes,"" President Ramaphosa said. Following an outcry over a spate of femicides last year, President Ramaphosa said South Africa was one of ""the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman"".

The photo was taken by Horace Cort at the Monson Motor Lodge swimming pool on 18th of June 1964. In reality, the famous photo shows a group of black and white inclusionists during a 1964 protest. The demonstration was related to the St. Augustine Campaign, named after the town where it took place in Florida. Violent reactions have resulted in many peaceful protests and marches and tricky protests. On June 11, 1964, after being requested to leave its secluded restaurant, Martin Luther King, Jr was arrested for infringement at Monson Motor Lodge. This led a number of black and white demonstrators to jump into the pool as a planned strategy to end racial in the ‚ÄúWhite Only‚Äù motel pools. White people who were paying for motel rooms welcomed blacks to join them as their guests in the motel pool. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his colleagues organized this swimming. In an attempt to disconnect the party, Jimmy Brock, Motel Manager, poured a bottle of Muriatic Acid into the swimming pool and eventually left the building. One of the swimmers, who knew the acid-to-pool ratio was so high that it was not a threat to them, was drinking a handful of pool water to sooth the fears of other swimmers. Numerous people from that time remember Brock in the acid incident as being more the victim. What the protesters heard, however, was the word ‚Äúacid‚Äù It was nervous to everyone but finally convinced others to not be afraid because the amount of acid was small to the amount of water in the pool. And then a policeman jumped in to have the demonstrators arrested. After the incident, in this acid incident, many people from that time believed that James Brock was more the victim. That unfortunate event has left an unwanted and indelible legacy. ‚ÄúThe brunt of this kind was caught by Jimmy. He has been a good man, ‚Äúsaid his long-standing friend and fellow hotelier, Eddy Mussallem. ‚ÄúThey had to choose a hotel, so Jimmy‚Äôs hotel was chosen. I told him he did a dumb thing every time. The pressures on James Brock were placed on civil rights and militant whites to fight integration. In his house in St. Augustine Jimmy Brock died in 2007. He was just 85 years old. In March 2003, despite five years of protests, the Monson Motor Lodge and swimming pool were demolished, removing one of Civil Rights Movement‚Äôs country landmarks. On the site, a Hotel Hilton was constructed. Credit: atchuup The African History is a reliable blog site dedicated to sharing African Culture and History.

"241",4804,"https://india.mongabay.com/2020/06/african-swine-fever-kills-thousands-of-pigs-in-assam-and-arunachal-pradesh/","African Swine Fever: Pigs in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh die","Mongabay Series: Environment And Health Bidarva Rajkhowa, a pig breeder, is a worried man these days. Despite his best efforts, he couldn‚Äôt keep the dreaded African Swine Fever (ASF) away from his Rajkhowa Pig Breeding Farm in Lakhimpur district of Assam, which he had set up in 2008. On May 13, the disease reached his farm. Initially, two sows and two piglets died from the disease on his farm. Subsequently, the disease spread to such an extent that Rajkhowa had to take the tough decision of culling 32 of his animals to contain the spread to nearby farms. His farm is said to be the first commercial pig farm in Lakhimpur district to be affected by the disease. Speaking to Mongabay-India, Rajkhowa said: ‚ÄúSince news started coming out about pigs dying from ASF in Assam, I took all the possible measures to increase bio-security and maintain hygiene in my farm. Despite that, the disease has entered my farm. We have buried the carcasses of the pigs that have died, as per protocol, and we are also disinfecting the place regularly. But still, more and more pigs have started showing symptoms of the disease. They have stopped eating.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have got 305 pigs on my farm. I have isolated the animals showing symptoms but if the virus reaches the rest of them, I will be ruined,‚Äù rued Rajkhowa, adding he imported pigs from Nepal and he is now facing a loss of Rs. 52 lakh. Lakhimpur is one of the 10 districts in Assam that have been affected by ASF. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the infections in domestic pigs in northeast India (Assam and Arunachal Pradesh) are the first occurrences of the disease in the country. ASF is a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease with almost a hundred percent mortality rate. While many signs of ASF and Classical Swine Fever (CSF) might be similar, the ASF virus is unrelated to the CSF virus. Some of the symptoms of ASF are high fever, depression, anorexia and loss of appetite, hemorrhages in the skin (redness of skin on ears, abdomen, and legs), abortion in pregnant sows, cyanosis, vomiting, diarrhoea and death within 6-13 days (or up to 20 days). The disease can be transmitted through direct contact with the infected pigs as well as through indirect contact like ingestion through contaminated materials like food waste, feed and garbage; contaminated fomites, and biological vectors. Once introduced, ASF spreads quickly through human activities and quickly becomes endemic in domestic pigs. Extremely challenging is the capacity of the virus to circulate in populations of wild boar, and via ticks. ASF virus is resistant and remains infectious for months in pork products and more than 1000 days in frozen pork. Humans play a major role in the short and long-distance introduction and spread of the virus, according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation. In August 2018, the outbreak of ASF was confirmed in China and since then it has been reported from many Asian countries like Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Indonesia. As per a statement from the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry minister of Assam, Atul Bora, the disease is suspected to have entered India via the eastern border of Arunachal Pradesh. The first case in Assam was reported from Jonai in Dhemaji district. The outbreak of ASF in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh was confirmed on May 1 by the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal after samples sent from those two states to the institute tested positive. As per the latest reports, 15,346 pigs in Assam and 2,253 in Arunachal Pradesh have died from the disease. With no approved vaccination available to treat the disease, culling is being considered to contain the spread of the outbreak. While the central government has reportedly advised the Assam government to go ahead with the culling, the state government is yet to take a decision on the matter. Pulin Das, director, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department (AH and VD) said, ‚ÄúWe are mulling on whether we should go ahead with the culling. We have asked for financial support from the central government as in the case of culling, we will have to pay huge amounts as compensation to farmers and farm owners.‚Äù Das informed Mongabay-India that as per government guidelines, a farmer gets compensation of Rs. 34,000 for sows, Rs. 25,000 for boars, and Rs. 13,500 for piglets (per animal). Das said the lockdown due to COVID-19 has been a blessing in disguise because the restriction in movement contained the spread to some extent. ‚ÄúThe main reason behind the initial spread was because many people dumped the carcasses of the infected pigs in the river. That trend has certainly decreased now.‚Äù Swaraj Rajkhowa, director of Pig Research Center of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) said, ‚ÄúThroughout the world, culling is considered an important part of the prevention set up for a disease like ASF. To minimise the outbreak, it is important to classify the area into zones. An area of 1 km radius from the epicenter where the disease originated will be known as infection zone while an area of 10 km radius from the epicenter will be known as a surveillance zone.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the surveillance area, random samplings will be taken and if the presence of the disease is found, it will become an infected area. In that case, culling will take place as per government guidelines. However, there will be variations depending on the situation. For example, if we find a farm in a surveillance area that is well maintained and devoid of any signs of the outbreak, that farm might not see any culling.‚Äù As per the latest developments, the culling compensation package is now on the verge of being finalised for Assam though there is no clarity on when the actual culling will start. Government sources, the state government will bear 50 percent cost of the package while the remaining 50 percent will be borne by the central government. A committee has been formed by the state government to monitor the situation. Apart from that, the AH and VD has also released guidelines for the farmers, like enhancing bio-security in their farms, not dumping carcass in open spaces and water bodies and burying the carcasses in a six feet deep trench, among others. The department has also restricted the trade and consumption of pork in the affected districts and started a toll-free number 1962 for the farmers. Pig rearing and farming play an important role in the rural economy of Assam and so, the outbreak of ASF has been a huge blow to the people associated with the trade. As per the 2019 census, Assam had over 21 lakh pigs, though as per authorities, the number has now touched 30 lakh. Bikash Konwar, a small pig farmer from Konwar Gaon village in Lakhimpur had taken a personal loan of Rs. 300,000 (Rs. 3 lakh) this year to upgrade his farm. His farm has been devastated by ASF: out of 44 pigs on his farm, only 13 have survived. Konwar said, ‚ÄúI am at my wit‚Äôs end thinking what to do now. I don‚Äôt have any other source of income other than the piggery. It was doing very well until the lockdown. But in the last two months, I haven‚Äôt earned a dime from it. Now, I don‚Äôt know how I will pay my loan back.‚Äù Manoj Basumatary, president, North East Progressive Pig Farmers‚Äô Association (NEPPFA) says that the pork market of Assam is worth Rs. 60-80 billion (Rs. 6000-Rs. 8000 crores) annually and the state has already lost close to Rs. 10 billion (Rs. 1000 crores) in the past two months. 300 pig farmers from the northeast are members of NEPPFA. He said, ‚ÄúTill now, the loss among farmers has been huge. The unorganised farmers who rear pigs in their backyards have been most heavily hit because bio-security practices are not much prevalent among them. As per my information, eight of our commercial piggery farms have also been affected. In fact, these farms are also in an evolving stage and don‚Äôt have very high biosecurity measures. This is what happened in Vietnam as well. Because of the lack of proper biosecurity measures, the disease spread so much that six million pigs had to be culled ultimately in Vietnam.‚Äù Basumatary, himself has a pig farm called Symbiotic Foods Private Limited near Tezpur, which he says is the biggest in the region with 1000 pigs. Commenting on the manner in which the government has tackled this crisis, he said, ‚ÄúThe first rule to tackle an outbreak is speed which I think is lacking here. Till now, the government has tested a very small number of samples. They have neither declared the affected areas as hotspots/affected zones nor have they decided to go ahead with the culling of infected pigs, which should have been done as per OIE guidelines.‚Äù Confusion over identical symptoms of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) and ASF has also added to misinformation among the pig farmers. Basumatary said: ‚ÄúOne major difference between CSF and ASF is in case of ASF, there is fall in temperature before the onset of clinical sign whereas, in case of CSF, there is no fall in temperature. But it is difficult to distinguish between the two diseases. This is why we think that the unofficial toll of livestock dying from ASF might be much higher because in many cases, a farmer might not report the death thinking the pig died from CSF.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, farmers are in a fix because, on one hand, they are unable to sell their pigs while they are also spending a hefty amount for the food and maintenance of these animals. The longer this situation continues, the population in the farm will go on increasing and more pigs will be at the mercy of the virus.‚Äù Bio-security is currently the buzzword in the pig farms with every farmer trying to improve the hygiene and disease prevention in their respective farms. Anjan Nag, who owns a small farm in Tengakhat village, around 30 kms from Dibrugarh says, ‚ÄúI started my farm in February this year and I am giving a lot of stress on bio-security. I have one worker on the farm who maintains total hygiene. He wears a special uniform and gumboots when he is on the farm. We also use potassium water to clean the barn where the pigs live.‚Äù While primarily it is the domestic pigs who have been the victims of ASF in northeast India so far, reports have come from Arunachal Pradesh about suspected death of wild boars from the disease. Recently, six carcasses of wild boars including three piglets were found in a community forest at Lidor Soyit upstream of Sillie river, which is about 25 km from Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh‚Äôs East Siang district. Tashi Mize, divisional forest officer (DFO), Pasighat told Mongabay-India, ‚ÄúLocal villagers were practicing horticulture there when they found some rotten smell coming out. Investigating the source of the smell, they discovered two carcasses and informed us. We found four more carcasses in the area. Unconfirmed reports of wild boars dying from ASF are also coming from Upper Siang district. There are abundant numbers of wild boars in these forests and we have alerted the local community not to hunt boars.‚Äù Kaziranga National Park (KNP) in Assam has a sizeable population of wild boars and the authorities are taking precautions to ensure the disease doesn‚Äôt affect them. Ramesh Chandra Gogoi, DFO, KNP said, ‚ÄúThe wild boar population in KNP can be pegged at 15,000. Once the disease starts affecting wild boars, it will be very difficult to contain the spread inside the jungle. So, to prevent the disease from entering KNP, we have taken several precautionary measures. We have asked our riverside camps to ensure that no floating carcasses enter the park.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs pigs are reared in most villages in the fringe of the park, we are trying to ensure the domestic pigs don‚Äôt enter the park for grazing. In Agoratoli, we have a 2 km long trench which has been successful in keeping the pigs at bay. Also, as our veterinarians can become potential carriers, we have asked them not to attend to outside cases for the time being.‚Äù There is no report of the wild population getting affected in Manas National Park (MNP). MNP is the home to the rare pygmy hogs. Amal Sarma, Director of MNP said, ‚ÄúWe are keeping a strict vigil and monitoring the situation. Till now, the disease hasn‚Äôt entered the park. We have around 1200 wild boars in the park and around 200 pygmy hogs. Recently 14 pygmy hogs which were captive-bred in Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP) were successfully released in MNP.‚Äù Recently Minister Atul Bora urged the youth who returned to Assam from other states due to COVID-19 pandemic to take up farming as a means of self-employment. NEPPFA suggested that the youth should be encouraged to come into the piggery sector. Basumatary said, ‚ÄúDespite the huge losses due to ASF, the piggery sector is still a lucrative business here. I am sure that the situation will improve in the coming days and youth who are looking for a source of income after the pandemic should come to the piggery sector.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Assam government has allowed certain relaxations in the consumption and selling of pork. Selling and consumption of pork are allowed in the districts unaffected by ASF and also in the affected districts excluding containment and surveillance zones. However, inter-district and inter-state buying, selling, and transfer of pork and pork products are yet to be permitted.

Please enter a search term. by: WAVY Web Staff, Regina Mobley Posted: Jun 12, 2020 / 01:14 PM EDT Updated: Nov 12, 2020 / 03:29 PM EST by: WAVY Web Staff, Regina Mobley Posted: Jun 12, 2020 / 01:14 PM EDT Updated: Nov 12, 2020 / 03:29 PM EST NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) ‚Äî A North Carolina man accused of making a threatening call to an African American church in Virginia Beach last week was arrested on Friday by federal authorities. John Malcolm Bareswill was charged with making a telephonic threat to use fire to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual, or unlawfully to damage or destroy a building. The 63-year-old is a Navy veteran from Catawba, North Carolina, who works and lives in Virginia Beach. The call to New Hope Baptist Church was placed on the morning of June 7, authorities say, days after a member of the church participated in a local prayer vigil at Mount Trashmore in the wake of George Floyd‚Äôs death. A federal affidavit filed on June 11 shows Bareswill called the church and said ‚Äúyou [racial slur] need to shut up‚Äù and threatened to burn down the church. The call was on speakerphone and three young children were present in the room. Previous coverage: Police investigate threat to burn a black church in Virginia Beach The affidavit is in support of the FBI criminal complaint and shows that Bareswill was questioned June 9 outside his place of business. It continues that a search of his mobile phone revealed an outgoing call to the church at 395 Old Great Neck Road that corresponded with phone records at the church. His browser history also shows that he searched the internet for several phrases, including ‚ÄúWho said all whites are racist,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter protest held in Virginia,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho organized the protests from mount trashmore to town center.‚Äù Additionally, the document says the suspect searched for at least three African-American religious institutions in the area including New Hope Baptist Church. On Saturday, WAVY confirmed that Bareswill is the owner of a UPS Store in the Kempsville area. State Corporation Commission documents revealed that John Bareswill owns the UPS Store in the 4800 block of Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. In 2015, he was recognized by UPS as a ‚Äúprime example of a veteran franchisee‚Äù in an article titled ‚ÄúHometown Heroes: The UPS Store Celebrates Veterans Day by Honoring Veteran Franchise Owners.‚Äù UPS Corporate Communications would not confirm the portion of the article that praises Bareswill or that the article has been pulled from the company‚Äôs public relations platforms. However, a UPS spokesperson issued a brief statement on Saturday confirming the company‚Äôs ties with Bareswill and plans to sever those ties. ‚ÄúThe UPS Store has zero-tolerance for racism, hatred, and bigotry. We are taking swift action to terminate his franchise agreement and he will no longer be associated with The UPS Store,‚Äù said Jenny Robinson in a statement issued exclusively to WAVY. New Hope Baptist Church spokesman Dr. James Allen said he does not know of any connection between Bareswill and the church ‚Äî which is pastored by E. Ray Cox, Sr. A few days before the threat was issued, Cox joined other members of the Virginia Beach Interdenominational Ministers Conference in a call for a month-long economic boycott of businesses along the Virginia Beach Oceanfront and Town Center. Allen thanked the FBI and local agencies in their expedient efforts to arrest the suspect. If convicted, Bareswill faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, according to officials.

Credit: Igor Rugwiza. On 25 April 2020, exactly five years after Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would run for a third term, I attended the virtual screening of a new documentary. The Forgotten of the Great Lakes, directed and produced by Burundian filmmaker Joseph Bitamba, looks at the use of rape as a weapon of war, following survivors in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and then Burundi. The Burundian survivors interviewed share one thing in common: they all lived in neighborhoods that actively protested against Nkurunziza‚Äôs third term in 2015 and were raped by security forces in retaliation. One woman‚Äôs testimony will haunt me forever. She does not wipe away her tears and her voice breaks as she describes how policemen and members of ruling party‚Äôs youth militia ‚Äì the notorious Imbonerakure ‚Äì burst into her home. They gangraped her, in front of her children, before trying to force her teenage son to rape her too. When he resisted, he was shot on the spot. He was left for dead, lying on top of his mother‚Äôs body, but survived his wounds. From that moment on, however, he was unable to look his mother in the eye. Having witnessed her violation and been forced to participate in it, something deeper than his physical wounds had been broken in him. He left home without saying a word a few days later, never to be seen again. When the news broke on 9 June that Nkurunziza had died, aged 55, my initial reaction was shock. It felt unreal, almost staged, a plot twist that befits literature, not real life. But slowly the shock began to fade as notifications exploded on my phone. Numbness cooled my veins and left me frozen, in a state I still can‚Äôt quite describe. I imagine what I am feeling is only a fraction of what these rape survivors felt upon hearing of his passing. Tradition in Burundi is deeply respectful of the dead. One does not speak ill of the deceased, certainly not in the early days. A seven-day national mourning period has begun across the country. My family and I prayed for the wife and children Nkurunziza leaves behind tonight. But I shed no tears over his untimely death. My tears, instead, are for the lives forever bruised and haunted by the pain his regime caused. I cry for the country we could have had these past five years; for the blood that could have been spared; for the memories families could have built together; for the amputated limbs of our young protestors; for the elderly who walked kilometres to end their lives in refugee camps; for the million little broken pieces so many of us have become. When Nkurunziza came to power in 2005, the air was full of possibility. A newly-elected president from the long oppressed Hutu majority was democratically acceding power, ending a decade of war. He promised change and social justice measures such as free primary education and maternity care. As a journalist at the time, pregnant with my first child, I covered the elections with enthusiasm at a new pan-African radio station. Independent media was flourishing, civic space was guaranteed, and there was an exceptionally open environment for political debate. Despite decades of politically induced ethnic tensions, Tutsis and Hutus alike seemed to believe in a new beginning for the nation. Things deteriorated slowly over Nkurunziza‚Äôs first term. Corruption and extrajudicial killings accelerated in his second. Then, in 2015, he announced he would run for a third, despite the constitution‚Äôs two-term limit. This prompted days of widespread protests. On 13 May, some soldiers carried out a failed coup. Soon after, the regime cracked down heavily on protesters, journalists, government opponents and activists. Many were imprisoned. The rest, including my own family, went into exile. Renaissance FM, the radio station I had helped start, was burnt to the ground. For many Burundians, waking up to photos of hand-tied, dead bodies stuffed in street gutters became the new norm. Human life lost value and family WhatsApp groups discussed murder and disappearances in the same breath as weddings and births. For exiled families like my daughters and I, the past five years have meant being torn from our lives and the innocence of childhood being forever halted in its course. I dedicated all my energy to bringing the regime‚Äôs crimes to light. I hoped, above all, that African states would break ranks from one of the worst dictatorships today. To put things in perspective, the notorious Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is estimated to have killed 3,200 people over 16 years. By 2018, it was estimated that Nkurunziza‚Äôs regime had killed 1,700 people in just 4 years. State violence is not new to Burundi. Nkurunziza followed in the footsteps of his predecessors, including those who murdered his own father in 1972 and those he fought to overthrow with his rebellion. He was the product of a cycle of impunity, which is at the root of Burundi‚Äôs recurring crises. It pains me that his sudden death robs us of another chance to install a culture of justice and accountability so essential for lasting peace. Perhaps the greatest irony in Nkurunziza‚Äôs death is his dismissal of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent rallies in support of his successor Evariste Ndayishimiye, who won presidential elections just three weeks ago, he claimed that God had purified Burundi‚Äôs air and that no masks were necessary in his blessed land. One of the last acts of his government was to expel World Health Organisation representatives and dismiss the need for preventative measures. Although the official cause of Nkurunziza‚Äôs death is a heart attack, rumours abound that he had contracted the virus. His wife, Denise Bucumi, was airlifted to Kenya for treatment days earlier, a luxury most Burundians cannot afford to dream of. He leaves his country at high risk, with some of the poorest health infrastructure on the continent. Those who were close to Nkurunziza or directly benefited from his rule grieve him today. It is their right. But his death should not sanitise his life. I am holding space for a different loss, for the deaths which are not reported and for which flags will not fly at half mast. I mourn the tortured, the imprisoned, the impoverished. Nkurunziza may find peace in death, but his victims will live with the wounds of his rule for the rest of their lives. My heart goes out to them. May a new dawn rise for them and for the Burundian people as a whole. This is the hard work that awaits us all.  Ketty Nivyabandi is a poet and activist from Burundi. In 2015, she successfully mobilised women to peacefully protest President Nkurunziza's bid for a third term in office. She later left her country after numerous threats on her life and currently resides in Canada. This is just so traumatic. That people can decide to be so inhuman as to lose a sense of humanity is something that still baffles me. Like what would one gain by such a senseless system of torture on the helpless citizens. But I find a lot of similarities in Nkurunziza‚Äôs evil acts with those of Jean Francois Duvallier of Haiti. Both made themselves the supreme beings, used the militia groups to crudely silence voices of dissent. With the unfortunate effect that women lived to suffer the most, as men never remained alive at all. This is an incredibly powerful and beautifully written piece. From God we all come and to Him we shall return. Ketty you represent many people all over the World. For Burundi and Africa your story and view point is priceless. Burundi has had its fair share of trauma coming from all sorts including bad politics. We now know that Burundi is bigger than one man. Let peace and development prevail in Burundi. ‚ÄúBe the change you wish to see in the world ‚Äú- I don‚Äôt see anywhere where white people constantly say ‚Äúblack people, black people, black people but we black people create these platforms where we think we can constantly condemn another race, call them racist and still don‚Äôt see that we are being racist ourselves! We all need to change attitudes! Being Kenyan and having been of age during the Rwandan Genocide, I have always wondered where Burundi went. It is important to have a governmental system that holds people to accountability. Never tire of doing the right by your country men. Lord knows, we need people like you here in Kenya. God be with you. President Pierre Nkurunziza, now departed, might as well be one of the most misunderstood figures of our time. The ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù is a deliberate outcome of a deliberate effort to discredit him, as well as his inability (or unwillingness) to respond to the pervasive and highly oiled propaganda machine enabled by his fascist predecessors and neighboring Rwanda. Ms. Ketty‚Äôs passionate writing can be viewed in this context‚Äìthat of denying the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù that forms this country‚Äôs voice. Such a predisposition and determination to bend progress (for Hutu and Batwa) is undoubtedly empowered by historical privilege. For a comparison, think of white South Africans who cry that the ANC is pursuing a policy of genocide against them. That anti-Nkurunziza propagandists gain widespread audience and credence without placing their complaints into a historical context is the tragedy of our time. Mistakes were made during Mr. Nkurunzia‚Äôs rule, but no government can completely avoid missteps. Most observers, including Mr. Nkurunzia‚Äôs strongest critics, agree that his first two terms were quite successful and monumental. Senator Krueger, a former US ambassador to Burundi, has described him as a ‚ÄúNelson Mandela of our time.‚Äù Such a description is not just lazy pontification. Mr. Nkurunziza inherited a state that was widely dilapidated and destroyed by years of Tutsi-led apartheid and ethnic cleansing. Even the strongest critics agree that he was largely able to unite Hutu and Tutsi people, which would have been previously unthinkable. His efforts towards educational equality are almost unparalleled in recent times. Consider this: when Mr. Nkurunziza left to join the rebellion in the 1990s, a majority of his Hutu classmates were exterminated at the National University of Burundi. In fact, the Tutsi government of Micombero killed Nkurunziza‚Äôs Hutu father. How does one address deep-seated historical injustices when a group that was previously no more than vassals find themselves in charge of the state? Most examples we have in history are hardly neat. Burundi‚Äôs neighboring Rwanda at one point had close to one million people in jail. Mr. Nkurunziza insisted Burundi couldn‚Äôt look back. He was acutely aware that pursuing historical injustices would jeopardize his power balance. This might perhaps be his greatest mistake. How else would one explain that Mr. Pierre Buyoya, the Tutsi butcher of tens of thousands of Burundians, is now an African Union envoy in Mali, and lecturing present-day Burundi on democracy? Of course, Mr. Buyoya and his accomplices, who never faced any scrutiny for their past crimes against humanity, were always going to undermine Mr. Nkurunziza‚Äôs rule. Lastly, some specific reference to Ketty‚Äôs allegations. I imagine that most of them, if not all, are actually accurate. But there goes the dangers of a single story. In 2015, over 200 Burundian policemen were killed. I tried to imagine what would happen if a handful of police officers are murdered by ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù in the US during the ongoing strife. Very few can disagree that the response would likely be very heavy handed. States have a hard time responding to peaceful protestors. When provoked by violent uprisings, states respond in heavy-handed ways. 2015 undoubtedly changed Mr. Nkurunziza, it also changed Burundi. Now that Mr. Nkurunziza has exited the stage, newer possibilities are on the horizon. Ketty thanks for audest of writing such a wonderful piece am sure may people have and will read about it and maybe get a lesson from it..there are so many people out there who are victims of such ruthless leaders I pray that this comfarts and gives them psychological peace of mind. All leader should learns that‚Äôs karma is abitch people may not get to u directly but some how u will pay for you‚Äôre deeds dying at 55 is punishing enough what is not worse like you‚Äôre children reading such a piece of work when you‚Äôre Dead This article is deliberately historically myopic and a bitter self-centered tantrum by a privileged ar-chair activist. Actions have reasons and causes. And they all lie in Burundi‚Äôs painful history 1962-2004 when a million bodies littered this country before Nkurunziza became president. Through his goodwill a peace deal was signed in 2003 and the country began to recover from its nightmare. 2015‚Äôs mini crisis with 400 victims on both sides had its reasons and Nkurunziza was not the cause, just the scapegoat. 400 dead is just one day of massacres that Nkurunziza and his people were victims of in 1972 and 1993-2003. Nkurunziza, national hero and architect of Burundi‚Äôs peace who unlike the regions‚Äô other leaders sacrificed himself and his reputation for his country and was leaving office willingly despite having the right to continue. The ‚Äúguys‚Äù who caused the 2015 insurrectional movement are the ones to be accountable not the President. We all know political reasons behind that violent movement supported and funded by ‚Äúwestern powers‚Äù who didn‚Äôt want him and his regime to continue. He barred their corridor to ‚ÄúKatanga‚Äù in DRC for their minerals robbery from DRC. He also established strong relationships with China and Russia. He supported different emancipation movements around Africa continent. He was acclaimed as an examplary panafricanist by many Africans. All of these elements didn‚Äôt please the West. Of course they are people who died when he was in power, but he shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable for every single death, including ones caused by outside factors. The passing President had done a lot on reconciliation side and education. We all know long uncertain periods Burundi was rising from. If you doubt, go to countryside and ask how many didn‚Äôt finish their high school studies, didn‚Äôt attend universities, or didn‚Äôt pursue fields they wanted because they feared of being executed simply because of they were created. Ask how many people didn‚Äôt know if they ever succeeded or not the national exam done at the end of primary school (Concours National). Burundians needed to heal first their long wounds. Development is not an overnight even, and we couldn‚Äôt just jump into an economic boom. May the late President, the Unifier, the freedom fighter and brave Rest In Peace. Indeed, ‚ÄúThe tomb of a hero reposes in the hearts of alive ones.‚Äù My prayers go to the immediate family of H.E. Nkurunziza, the government of Burundi, his origin political party and all Burundians. Hello Horja,Ofcourse charity begins at home and that is a fact. Interesting that I do not see where in Ketty‚Äôs article she referred to any race, black or white. Ketty appeared to be reflcting on her own suffering and fellow Burundian‚Äôs trauma perpetrated by Nkurunziza whilst he was in power.That wasn‚Äôt hard was it? Who killed Ndadaye and were they ever convicted or handed to the ICC? As a southern African and student of recent African History I know the injustices that have befallen the Burundians and completely ignored by the world. Unfortunately most people are ignorant of the real butchers in Burundi. Jacob Ndashimiye,You have written a novel!!Not sure if it it was all worth the space.You seem to be condoning evil acts and Nkurunziza sympathizer.Very absurd. Eliseus,You sound terrible!I would not mistake you for an imbonerakure.The reason being given your view point.What would stop you murdering your own people or joining in on a ganga rape of the defenseless. The evil that men do follows them. It is a global culture not to celebrate death and our sympathy to the family of the deceased President. What happened should serve as a cautionary measure that God lives and that there is an indirect price for evil doers. Governance is not about heaping mayhem on the people but about leaving a land mark in the hearts of the people that you meant to serve. A public servant should be humane and demonic. It seems the late Nkurunziza‚Äôs propaganda machine is bent on misleading the opinion. 15 years of misrule left the country in economic and social shambles. He died while he was under investigation by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Sadly his victims will never have justice unless the ICC can impound the immense wealth stashed in tax Havens to pay reparations to Nkurunziza‚Äôs victims. As the Panama Papers disclosed, Nkurunziza had amassed a fortune amounting to US$ 160 Million. At the demise of Nkurunziza, Burundi is left the poorest and the unhappiest country in the world. The cost in terms of youth lives needlessly destroyed is staggering. Contrary to the propaganda smoke screen we are reading here, he was opposed mainly by his own party leadership including the Vice-President IGervais Rufyikiri and Speaker of Parliament Pie Ntavyohanyuma and countless government officials. His own intelligence CEO, General Godefroid Niyombare, wrote to him a searing letter imploring him not to stand for an illegal third term. It‚Äôs only after loosing the support of his own rank and file that he started fanning ethnic hatred. Yet during his term he had ruthless killed his fellow tribesmen who adhered to opposition leader Agathon Rwasa. He resumed killing them in the run-up to the May 2020 elections that Rwasa is believed to have won. Burundi masses were yearning for change under the leadership of another Hutu president, Agathon Rwasa, to take them out the untold misery they live in. Their dreams were dashed by a stolen election from them. They are in for another 15 years of economic collapse since the same system remains in power. For those who don‚Äôt know the author Ketty Nivyabandi, let me enlighten them. Ms. Ketty Nivyabandi is a poet, top-notch intellectual (she amazingly masters English and French in equal measures), community leader cum revolutionary. On 13 May 2015, she managed to galvanise Burundi women from all walks of life: professionals, traders, employees, students, slum dwellers, millennials, who took entire control of Bujumbura city centre where men had failed at a great human cost. The courage of women rallied men from all of Bujumbura districts and the butcher of Bujumbura (as Kenyan cartoonist, Gado, eloquently summed it up) Nkurunziza was non-violently toppled only to be saved by a last-minute and unfortunate military coup attempt in the afternoon of that fateful day. Women, and African women for that matter, are a special breed. I had tears in my eyes when Rev. Alan Sharpton, at the Minneapolis Memorial for martyred George Floyd, paid tribute to the exceptional African-American mamas who single-handedly raise black families and build the nation just like in Africa. Ruthless Dictator Sekou Toure said when women took to the street against him: ‚ÄúIf women are against us, we are finished.‚Äù Thanks to the tremendous courage of Burundi women, the Butcher of Bujumbura was finished only to be saved by an unfortunate military coup attempt. From there, Nkurunziza went on to kill the youth leaders one by one, dumping their bodies in the street, and when he finished them off, he moved on to civil society and human rights activists, one by one. When he missed by a whisker the famed Human Rights Leader Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa who miraculously survived a bullet in the neck, he killed his son-in-law and next Pierre Mbonimpa‚Äôs teenager son in retaliation for his survival and evacuation to Europe. Cruelty at diabolical level. Yet, during the civil war, nobody touched Nkurunziza‚Äôs family though he was commander of a guerrilla army that targeted mainly innocent Tutsi villagers without sparing even schools. His wife and children lived peacefully in Bujumbura. He didn‚Äôt have the moral high ground to spare the lives of family folks of non-violent opponents who opposed him peacefully. Nkurunziza lived a life of lies to his very end. He lied he was a born-again christian yet he killed, maimed, tortured, raped, jailed and exiled thousands of innocent youths for the only crime of expressing peacefully their constitutional opinion. He lied that he was chosen by God while he was a monster from hell. He lied that God had spared and shielded Burundi from Covid-19 while he died of coronavirus. In all this tragedy, the EAC failed Burundi. The EAC was the guarantor of the Arusha Accords for Peace and Reconciliation, yet it indifferently let Nkurunziza butcher his own people. Martin Luther King Jr. said: ‚ÄúIn the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. ‚Äú Prince, What do you mean by a public servant should be himane and demonic? IDI, I am a Burundian, not imbonerakure! I am a Burundian who understands the history, where we came from and where we want to reach. There is no paradisiac State on Earth, let‚Äôs be realistic. Burundi is peaceful, know people who live in it. I am fed up with this propagandistic media that keeps insulting the image of Burundi and Africa in general.

The Bill, AB 3121, was introduced by Assemblywoman Dr. Shirley Weber, moved forward in a 60-14 vote and will now head to the California State Senate. According to the Bill: This bill would establish the Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans, consisting of 8 members, appointed as provided. The bill would require the Task Force to, among other things, identify, compile, and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation of the institution of slavery that existed within the United States and the colonies. The bill would require the Task Force to recommend, among other things, the form of compensation that should be awarded, the instrumentalities through which it should be awarded, and who should be eligible for this compensation. The bill would require the Task Force to submit a written report of its findings and recommendations to the Legislature. The bill would authorize reimbursement of the members‚Äô expenses only to the extent an appropriation is made in the Budget Act.

This is absurd and one of the most ridiculous pieces of legislation I‚Äôve seen posted on this site. These state democrats are crazy since California entered the union as a FREE and non slavery state. Slavery ended in 1865 so I am a curious how in 155 years people think they are effected today? Why should I .. who never owned slaves ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ be forced to pay reparations to those who never were slaves? Idc what nobody say the truth is we still deal with racism and we out of good jobs and everything because of that racism is the backbone to all the problem y‚Äôall mf‚Äôs love to see blacks struggle if I was you I would just deal with it cause we dealt with yours for years it‚Äôs time for us to get back to get back right. @Shawn Stop blaming others. Problem is EDUCATION (as your post painfully points out). I would be more open to giving people free education vs. a bunch of free money that will be frivolously spent. Please look the differences between Asian Americans and how they value education and you‚Äôll understand that education is the way out, not being a rapper, sports star or blaming others‚Ä¶ Oh, knock off the BS already, Shawn! Why do so many blacks make it? Become doctors, lawyers, accountants, great actors, fabulous singers? Maybe those people didn‚Äôt sit around and sucking their thumbs but stayed in school, studied hard, made something of themselves! They put their energies into their goals no matter what obstacles they had to overcome Everybody has to do that no matter what their race. So? How long have you been a slave? Shawn? Poor Shawn! The world done him wrong! Was the third grade your SENIOR YEAR? ‚ÄúIf I was you?‚Äù No wonder you didn‚Äôt make it! Did someone run you out of school? Or did you choose to leave on your own and now the only job you can get is cleaning toilets? It‚Äôs not too late to go back and stick it out. Take a look at how many black people are doing fabulously well! They didn‚Äôt play ‚Äúthe blame game.‚Äù Nobody owes you anything! They forged on so don‚Äôt clump everyone into the same bucket. They took action. Don‚Äôt waste time bitching! Sorry, but this is not appropriate at the state level. Any discussion of ‚Äúreparations‚Äù must be at the national level. More posturing by California‚Äôs hopeless liberals. If someone can show me where any person today was alive when slavery was responsible for slavery show me. California was never a slave state. Stop pandering. Hey, I am 5 percent African American, Do I get a 5 percent check of this give away? This is a total hoax. We have too many politicians. They are bored and need to make things up to show they exist. My idea is cut politicians positions and staff by 40 percent and put those savings to correcting the homeless issue. This is wasting money to develop plans how to waste more money. Money = tax dollars. Not to mention the damage this would do to our society. And what about the one million plus people who died to free the slaves? Many families got diminished so much that their last names became very rare. How is this taken into account? Fraser at his finest ‚Ä¶.. what an absurd niece of work ‚Ä¶.. Has Frazier lost his freakin‚Äô mind? I‚Äôm calling his office and raising bloody hell! We‚Äôre already bee paying reparations to blacks for decades and decades. It‚Äôs called WELFARE! The Japanese who were paid reparations were the ones who actually were relocated to camps for the duration of WW2. Welfare was for EVERYONE! And‚Ä¶statistically whites are on welfare more than any other nation in America. There‚Äôs more whites than any other culture in America. Do your research. How is welfare a reparation for blacks if whites get more of it than blacks do? So if welfare was a reparation then whites stole that from blacks also! I guess you were not in class the day your teacher taught percentages, were you, Carbon! Welfare was for everyone and it has been statistically proven that whites are on welfare more than every other nation in America. So whites stole welfare too. Wait, so since the Irish were slaves, too‚Ä¶does that mean they get money as well? https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/poverty-reduction-programs-help-adults-lacking-college-degrees-the. Apparently you may need to re-educate yourself with your bs. White people receive more welfare in the country than any other group. Go climb into your racist hole. Could you BE ANYMORE RACIST??? Wow you don‚Äôt even try to hide it Is that the way you were raised??? You should be ASHAMED of yourself really!!! Try to do better!!!! Seems like you, just like your pal Carbon, skipped school the day percentages was taught, eh, Sayitaintso! I guess both of you attended government schools. I called Frazier‚Äôs office today and raised bloody hell. Has he totally lost his mind? Looks like that Weber woman used blackmail to get all those people to vote ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I‚Äôve noticed that most of those who voted ‚ÄúAyes‚Äù are men. Scary how many of these Liberal men have totally lost their manhood. They cave in to all women, to young rioters like Antifa, they wash black people‚Äôs feet, take the knee showing capitulation to the mob! What is going on? Practice PC which is a nice way of describing cowardice. Have they no shame? Any backbone left? These men are not ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù. They are dead zombies. Dont you think weve given enough compensation through welfare over the years? Welfare was for EVERYONE! And‚Ä¶statistically whites are the highest percentage of people on welfare in America. Do your research. How can welfare be a reparation for blacks if whites are benefiting from it the most? So technically if welfare was a reparation for blacks then whites stole that from the blacks also. This is complete nonsense & crap. NO ONE here has been a slave. NO ONE alive today in America has earned any pay back for slavery. AFRICANS had slaves and sold tribe members into slavery, plus still today, many Muslim countries continue slave trade. Egyptians had slaves, Europeans had slaves, Africans had slaves & SOLD criminals from their tribes and SOLD captured tribe members into slavery. There were many slaves from Europe including white and other races. Total ignorance to history; self serving clueless pandering freeloaders are crazy. I nor no one in my family has EVER owned a slave but we have worked hard all our adult lives to make ends meet. Corrupt politicians hoping to buy more votes off taxpayers backs. My husband is Native American and I am Irish. Let‚Äôs get a bill going for all the abuse our ancestors suffered. I think everyone has a history that night require reparation. Why do I owe anything since my family was from the North and fought to free the slaves!!!! How do we know which people had ancestors who were slaves? I SAY WE ALL PROTEST AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. If protesting doesn‚Äôt work get violent!!!!! That might work. These comments are almost funny. All these white people with their panties in a bunch because they don‚Äôt think something‚Äôs fair‚Ä¶because of race. Well ain‚Äôt that the pot calling the kettle black! You still don‚Äôt get it. But hey‚Ä¶for most of you your racism is all you have‚Ä¶.that and ranting about it in comment sections. You wouldn‚Äôt dare speak any of this out loud. Hey ME, it has been taught the original owners of slave were of African decent. They did sell their own to the world and highest bidder ridding themselves of people they want casted out. From there it evolved into something inhumane and disgusting. From there it began to correct the Wrongful selling of humans. From there 600,000 white people died to make the wrong right. From there it really had advanced quite a bit until entitlement and greed showed its ugly head and set progress in reverse. If you paid attention to history classes you may understand the real history. I‚Äôm just sayin. In no world should people trash and burn their own community. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I never hold back anything, ME. Be it online or in person! People get to know how I feel very quickly and there is nothing they can do about it. Let them just try and they won‚Äôt end up in a good place. There are many highly educated blacks holding great jobs! How did they get there? Just like the rest of us ‚Äì through education, ambition and perseverence. It‚Äôs 20% talent and 80% HARD WORK! Try it sometime and see how that works! We owe them?? Perhaps they owe us.. !0,000‚Äôs of thousands of white men gave their lives to free the slaves. I have never heard a black man tell us whites ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù for freeing out ancestors. They make is sound as if all whites owned slaves. That is not true. This was only applicable in the south. And over 75% of the southern people did not own slaves. Something else that blacks never mention is that black/negro men owned slaves. The 1830 U.S. Federal Census showed that there were 3,777 black/negro men owning slaves. It is time that all of the facts about slavery and the slave owners be presented. Not just the facts that justify your complaints. So if that‚Äôs the case!!! Me being of Mexican decent.. Should get reparations for having land taken and treaty of Guadeloupe not being honored. Right? Why should my tax paying dollars go to a bunch a different stuff that I have not been affiliated with? Freakin pandering politics! All of you on here complaining will still vote for the same democrats so be quiet. You want to do something? Go vote. Go protest. I‚Äôve never voted for a Democrat and I started voting 9 years ago! I would never, ever vote for a Democrat. Vote out the democrats if you don‚Äôt like or be quiet. Please read this R-E-A-L S-L-O-W and understand it I have never seen this said as simply and as well: Class war at its best. The folks who are getting the free stuff don‚Äôt like the folks who are paying for the free stuff , because The folks who are paying for the free stuff can no longer afford to pay for both the free stuff and their own stuff. And the folks who are paying for the free stuff want the free stuff to stop. And the folks who are getting the free stuff want even moref ree stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting! Now. The people who are forcing the people who pay for the free stuff have told the people who are RECEIVING the free stuff that the people who are PAYING for the free stuff are being mean, prejudiced, and racist. So.. The people who are GETTING the free stuff have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free stuff by the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff and giving them the free stuff in the first place. We have let the free stuff giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff . Now understand this. All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250years after being founded. The reason? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them. The United States officially became a Republic in 1776 , 243 years ago. The number of people now getting free stuff outnumbers the people paying for the free stuff . Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it. ELECTION 2020 IS COMING A Nation of Sheep Breeds a Government of Wolves! : You know if you understand anything about free stuff and who is paying for it and who receives it you will know that what Dawn said about free stuff and politicians is true. With that said, no more free stuff because of what Dawn said. And that‚Äôs all I have to say about that. Trump has more and more blacks joining his team. They know Trump is the real deal and Democrats are all fake. Trump will get 40% of the black vote and send tremors through the Democrat Party because the Democrat model is broken. Blacks have finally figured it out. Democrats have been using them all along and give them a few bread crumbs to keep them happy. Blacks no longer are willing to accept more bread crumbs, they now want a life and Democrats who are anti-capitalist have no way of delivering. Blacks are starting to get it. The government TIT is nothing more than plantation living and it is slightly above poverty when in fact through capitalism they could live like anyone else. Democrat Section 8 housing, welfare, and the government TIT is subsistence living. It‚Äôs not a life. Life is when you earn disposable income. Democrat Socialism is not the route to disposable income. Blacks are now starting to learn that The assembly has no business legislating slavery since California never became involved in black slavery. Native Indians, and later, the Chinese were the slaves of California. This Assembly does not even know their own history as proof these races are not included in the bill. It makes better reason if the state of Georgia wrote this legislation. The Chinese were brought here to work on the railroad as CONTRACTORS. They were not immigrants and had to return to their home country and most did. That brings up Chinese and Irish. Do they get a reparation bill? Oh, and how about a woman‚Äôs reparations bill? They weren‚Äôt allowed to vote. I can‚Äôt wait until this voting cycle ends. There is so much BS out there right now it‚Äôs pathetic. Comments are closed.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who called for the Minneapolis police to ‚Äúdisband‚Äù and then ‚Äúreimagine‚Äù in the name of social justice, the majority of African Americans has never wanted and does not want the police to leave their community. The Minneapolis Police Department has proven themselves beyond reform. It‚Äôs time to disband them and reimagine public safety in Minneapolis. Thank you to @MplsWard3 for your leadership on this! https://t.co/AQfHM5M6eR ‚Äî Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) June 5, 2020  This sentiment, despite being unpopular, is being shouted by Black Lives Matter protesters, who loudly booed the Minneapolis mayor when he refused to endorse defunding the police. According to the Gallup poll, released on August 6, 2015, even though the African American community was split on whether police treat them fairly, a total of 92 per cent of poll respondents indicated they are either comfortable with the current number of police or would prefer additional police. 33 per cent of African Americans want a higher police presence in their community, and interestingly, of those African Americans who specifically believe that they are treated unfairly by police, 44 per cent want a larger police presence in their community. 59 per cent of African Americans want the current number of police to be maintained, leaving only 8 per cent calling for less police. This is also true for white and Hispanic Americans. Among whites, 94 per cent want the same or more police, and among Hispanics, 95 per cent want the same or more police. These results appear not to have changed wildly in the intervening five years, as a now famous YouGov poll reveals that despite the constant haranguing of Black Lives Matter protesters across the country, only 16 per cent of Americans want the police to be defunded: Despite calls by activists and protesters to defund police departments, most Americans do not support reducing law enforcement budgets. Close to two-thirds (65%) oppose cutting police force funding. Just 16 percent of Democrats and 15 percent of Republicans support that idea. While the number of those who want less or ‚Äúdefunded‚Äù police has grown from 7 per cent to 16 per cent in five years, it remains a minority view only held by a select few. As was indicated in 2015, there is, however, bipartisan support for expanding police education and resources when it comes to deescalating conflicts, identifying potential bad police officers, and increasing to use of body cameras to record the behavior of police and the public they interact with. ¬© 2022 NationalFile.com National File, LLC.

When Black people cannot move freely in the communities in which we all live, then our public spaces can never deliver on their promise of equitably benefiting all. Each of us deserves a right to clean air, clean water, and access to nature for the health of ourselves and our communities. We condemn all acts of violence, intimidation and police brutality against Black People and people of color. And we stand with all who are peacefully expressing their solidarity against the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, and many others. By now you‚Äôve probably seen the news about the Trump administration‚Äôs reprehensible use of the United States Park Police, other federal police forces and National Guard to clear a public park in Washington, DC, of peaceful demonstrators. Parks have been created for everyone to gather and find solace in the outdoors and with each other; they should never be places of hatred, terror or retribution. I also want to underscore that some of the high-profile injustices against Black people in recent weeks have occurred in the outdoors. Ahmaud Arbery was killed while going for a run outdoors. Christian Cooper was harassed and racially profiled while birding in Central Park. These stories further demonstrate how Black people must live in fear of racially motivated violence, harassment or intimidation. We stand in solidarity with the African American community against these tragic injustices, and we are committed to working with partners to ensure our shared public lands are safe and welcoming for Black Americans as well as for everyone. There are many wonderful groups working for racial justice, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Whether you‚Äôre participating in peaceful protests or looking for other ways to speak up, we ask that you consider supporting these groups today.

As for the latest round of work aimed at turning the 277-acre park into a jewel that‚Äôs inviting to the public year-round, it‚Äôs understandable if you‚Äôve long had Fair Park fatigue. This city has been creating, commissioning, evaluating ‚Äî then forgetting ‚Äî plans to ‚Äúfix‚Äù Fair Park since I was a Central Texas junior high student, circa 1970. After a half century of big talk, the historic neighborhoods of South Dallas that surround the park ‚Äî many of whose residents had their land stolen to expand the State Fair ‚Äî are still holding an empty bag of broken promises and outright lies. I get it if you have tuned out completely from the it-never-seems-to-go-anywhere Fair Park discussion. But this month comes a development that should give us all a reason to re-engage, especially at this moment of reckoning on how we can move forward to acknowledge ‚Äî and as much as possible right ‚Äî the historic racial wrongs in Dallas. For those of you who threw out your playbook, the city in late 2018 awarded the job of operating the park to nonprofit Fair Park First and its for-profit partner, Spectra. Since then, the nonprofit has devoted itself to creating a master plan, sharing it with residents and business owners in the surrounding communities, and relentlessly massaging the proposal based on that feedback. Thursday, after several months of delays wrought by COVID-19, Fair Park First presented the final master plan to the Dallas Park and Recreation Board and won the representatives‚Äô hearty support. It was a huge ‚Äî if almost universally unnoticed ‚Äî moment because now, at long last, Fair Park First has a detail-rich proposal that allows it to begin the serious fundraising necessary to transform this concrete behemoth into the green space that this neighborhood and all park visitors deserve. Raising the amount of money needed just for phase one ‚Äî $85 million ‚Äî is not a job I envy. But Fair Park First board president Darren James said during the Thursday meeting that his team is already talking with prospective donors and has had ‚Äúinterest from one of the leading private citizens in Dallas that‚Äôs looking to give us a gift that we are using to move forward.‚Äù He wouldn‚Äôt get more specific when I called him Friday, but he‚Äôs adamant that now that potential donors can see the juicy details of Fair Park‚Äôs transformation, the dollars will follow. The biggest ticket item in phase one ‚Äî and the most critical piece of the project, in my opinion ‚Äî is ripping up the sea of concrete along Fitzhugh Avenue to create a 14-acre Community Park designed with a vibe akin to Uptown‚Äôs Klyde Warren Park. Free of fencing and accessible to all, the park will include a large tree-bordered lawn, a water feature, children‚Äôs play areas and a remembrance garden. And what a shameful history there is to remember on these acres that City Hall and the State Fair of Texas ripped away from African American families and businesses. It‚Äôs a story that can‚Äôt be retold too often: After a consultant told the city in 1966 that Fair Park was unpopular because of ‚Äúthe poor Negroes in their shacks‚Äù and that City Hall should ‚Äúeliminate the problem from sight,‚Äù the city cheated homeowners with low-ball offers and tried eminent domain to take other properties. Five years later, more than 300 properties had been scraped away, devastating the lives of families who had called this neighborhood home for a generation or more. That sordid reality is why Park Board president Calvert Collins-Bratton is most focused on the first phase of what could be a 20-year project. ‚ÄúWe cannot fail these neighbors who have lobbied and advocated and poured blood, sweat and tears into this area for so many years and gotten only empty promises,‚Äù she told me after the meeting. Phase one also will include the small MLK Gateway Park at one of the Fair Park entrances off Robert B. Cullum Boulevard and a 2-acre-plus music green that will soften and connect the area between the Music Hall and the African American Museum. To compensate for the hundreds of parking spaces lost to green space, phase one also will include a parking structure at the northeast end of the Community Park. Even under the rosiest fundraising scenario, don‚Äôt expect to see the signature park finished until 2024. Other highlights of the master plan ‚Äî additional small parks along Fair Park‚Äôs edges and the Blackland Prairie Trail ‚Äî are even further down the road. Park Board member Daniel Wood, who represents the district that includes Fair Park, expressed everyone‚Äôs point of view Thursday when he said he loves everything about the master plan ‚Äî except the one thing he hates: the time involved to get the work done. ‚ÄúBut if there‚Äôs any group that can make this happen, it‚Äôs this group,‚Äù Wood said. Wood wasn‚Äôt alone in his endorsement; I didn‚Äôt hear a negative voice in the bunch as Park Board members gave the project an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Collins-Bratton told me that she knows there‚Äôs still skepticism ‚Äî deservedly so, given how many false starts Fair Park neighborhoods have endured. But she expects the reaction ‚Äúwill be shock and surprise‚Äù when people see the many trees and 16 new acres of green spaces in phase one. Now that Fair Park First cleared the Park Board hurdle, the nonprofit can begin the process of selecting a landscape architect and finding those deep-pocket donors. The nonprofit seems to have done its community engagement homework in the course of hearing from more than 500 neighborhood voices. One of those, Dolphin Heights leader Anna Hill, who has consistently been fighting for decades for a better Fair Park, told me Friday that she‚Äôs cautiously optimistic. Hill doesn‚Äôt just care about Fair Park, she spends time walking there ‚Äî when the heat doesn‚Äôt make the concrete-heavy landmark unbearable. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sight to see ‚Äî mask, gloves and carrying a peach tree limb,‚Äù she laughed. She told me she‚Äôs never run into any trouble there, but as she celebrates her 80th birthday this week, she‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry. Hill actually helped advise another nonprofit that competed against Fair Park First for the right to take charge of things there. So it‚Äôs not insignificant that she is feeling at least a little hopeful about the master plan. After reviewing the final 55-page proposal Friday, she said it looks good ‚Äî at least on paper. ‚ÄúI like all the pockets of green space. That‚Äôs better than a lot of cement. ‚Ä¶ Those trees and lawns are what Fair Park should have had in it a long time ago.‚Äù Hill also pointed out that, for longer than she can remember, she‚Äôs been disappointed a bunch of different ways in the neglect and empty promises made about Fair Park. She is especially worried about whether Fair Park First will find that $85 million. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt get funding, it may not come through. ‚Ä¶ Is it going to be years before you get someone to back you?‚Äù Dallas has always proven itself bighearted when it comes to philanthropy. Now is our chance to begin healing one of this city‚Äôs old open wounds by planting the long-promised Community Park and other accessible Fair Park green spaces. Sharon Grigsby.

Image: Reuters South African scientists will be monitoring developments in Brazil which is also about to resume a large COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Brazil will embark on a study similar to the one which started in South Africa this week, that hopes to effectively respond to the global pandemic. The trial aims to find a vaccine that will prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals. Professor of Vaccinology at Wits University, Shabir Madhi, who is also the leader of the vaccine trial in South Africa says while South Africa and Brazil have similarities, the COVID-19 response has been totally different and they are hoping for better outcomes in South Africa. ‚ÄúSouth Africa has been much more aggressive than Brazil in terms of trying to slow the rate of transmission of the virus, but these are both complex societies, both Brazil as well as SA. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a correct thing to make comparisons between countries. It is unfortunate that Brazil seems to be ahead of the curve compared to where we are in SA and we can only hope that what we experience in SA in the next month doesn‚Äôt sort of mirror what is happening in Brazil at this point in time,‚Äù says Madhi. While all hopes are for a successful vaccine at the end of the trial, it might be halted midway should challenges emerge. Madhi says an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee is watching the trials in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. On Wednesday, South Africa joined various parts of the world in beginning vaccine trials for COVID-19. The large-scale vaccine trial will see 2000 participants between the ages of 18-65 be enrolled, half will be given the vaccine, while the other half will be administered a placebo. The trial is funded by the Bill Gates Foundation through its partnership with the South African Medical Research Council.

Several international footballers are using their platforms to express support for the fight against racism in the US and beyond. The recent murder of George Floyd, another unarmed Black man, has sparked great outrage and protest within the streets of the US and cities across the world. With professional sports slowly making their way back onto our screens, many famous faces in football have shown solidarity to those fighting for the cause. Manchester United Midfielder Paul Pogba expressed his sadness on a recent Instagram post. The player wrote ""Sadness for George and for all Black people who suffer from racism every day! Whether in football, at work, at school, anywhere!"" This comes after Pogba himself has experienced explicit racism during his professional career. In 2019, he and Man United striker Marcus Rashford fell victim to harsh racial abuse over social media. Using the hashtag ""#NoToRacismWeAllOne"", the football star's plea brought power and support to the thousands protesting across the world.  See on Instagram Similarly, Moroccan defender Achra Hakimi showed his support during Borussia Dortmund's recent win against Paderborn, with a shirt that had the words ""Justice for George Floyd"" written across it:   While celebrating his first hat trick in his professional career, Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jadon Sancho also took the opportunity to show his support for the fight for freedom in a similar fashion:   During one of their team practices, Liverpool Football Club players, including Egypt's Mo Salah and Senegal's Sadio Mane, took a knee to show support and to emphasize strength in numbers and coming together. Mane, who has been outspoken about the racism faced by Black players, shared the image on Instagram, writing ""Unity is strength #BlackLivesMatter.""

"259",5226,"https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/jet-li-on-supporting-african-entrepreneurs/vjylh22","Jet Li on supporting African entrepreneurs","Authors: As a board member of the Jack Ma Foundation, martial artist, actor and philanthropist Jet Li has been involved some of the foundations key campaigns, including its Africas Business Heroes competition. To date, the foundation has received 18,000 applications from candidates representing all 54 countries across the continent. This week, it also extended the deadline for applications to June 22 in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances facing small businesses due to Covid-19. Ahead of this year's competition, we spoke to Li about his experience participating in last year's finale in Ghana, how he got involved with the project and why he thinks our global interdependence has made collaboration and mutual learning increasingly important. This interview has been translated from Mandarin and edited for length and clarity. What was it like to travel to Accra, Ghana, last November for the Africa's Business Heroes championship? In 1977, I represented China's national martial arts team and toured 10 African countries for about 60 days. I was 13 at the time. It opened my eyes to many new life experiences, like traveling, flying on a plane, eating the local food and experiencing different cultures. Last year was my second time in Africa. Of course, it had changed a lot from what I remember from the 1970s. Participating in Africa's Business Heroes showed me a different side to the continent. I heard many moving stories and new perspectives through the competition. Personally going to Africa really gave me a better sense of its cultures and the unique issues that it's facing. What inspired you the most about the entrepreneurs you met in Africa? Last year, the first-place winner left the strongest impression on me. I've never heard of a business like hers: In some parts in Africa, women might not have easy access to well-equipped hospitals and so the risk of suffering excessive and potentially life-threatening blood loss can be particularly high during childbirth. Temie Giwa-Tubosun's startup, LifeBank, delivers blood to pregnant women. We're used to seeing deliveries of food or even daily necessities, but for me, this idea to deliver blood was astounding. Delivering blood could save the lives of mother and child. You wouldn't realize this if you were to only donate funds instead of personally visit Africa and witnessing the ingenious solutions to very real and unique issues. Can you tell us a little more about the Jack Ma Foundation? How did you get involved? I met Jack in 2007, when I set up the One Foundation. He helped me a lot at that time to decide our positioning and build an efficient, results-oriented platform. One Foundation is a public foundation. As a result, it has to adhere to many restrictions. For example, funds for earthquake relief can't be used for rain-triggered disasters, while funds for landslides can't be used to support diseases like the coronavirus pandemic. I'm honored for the chance to help with establishing Jack's foundation, too, which is a private foundation. That gives us more flexibility to immediately take action for problems we want to solve and projects that are Jack's dreams. For example, in China, we focus on a few projects related to education ‚Äì including rural education and the cultivation of teachers, principals and teachers-in-training. Africa is another dream of his. I'm grateful to take part in this meaningful project, which started purely out of Jack's concern for humanity. We both love China's wuxia culture and the idea that we should care about the greater good. It's not enough to become wealthy and fight our own fight. We have to do something for our one human family. What does the Jack Ma Foundation hope to achieve in Africa? Africa has 54 countries and is home to 1.2 billion people. Jack said that since the population is relatively young, young entrepreneurs play an extremely important role in driving economic growth in the future. I agree very much with that. To truly bring change to Africa, young people would need to become role models and first change themselves. This is a fundamental kind of change. We want to spend 10 years to create a platform to help more young people with dreams become ""heroes,"" who set examples and inspire even more young entrepreneurs. Beyond the goal of cultivating 100 entrepreneurs, I'm even more interested in seeing how many young people would awaken to become heroes, how many more people they'd inspire and how much effort and funds they'd devote to motivating other young people. The future of Africa belongs to young people. Generation after generation, they will truly bring change to Africa. What's the significance of Africa's Business Heroes for entrepreneurs? They'd not only receive financial support ‚Äì which can be extremely encouraging for a small business ‚Äì but they would also gain access to experienced mentors and successful business leaders that can shed light on the issues they have now and can potentially have in the future. Their guidance can help entrepreneurs potentially avoid pitfalls. Whether it's businesses that are just starting off, growing or scaling rapidly, they all face common issues and struggles. This platform encourages people to share their experiences, learn new things and encourage new generations of entrepreneurs. What are some valuable lessons that you have learned in your professional career that might be useful for these entrepreneurs? We're all just people encountering different problems at different ages. Sometimes, I'd hear entrepreneur friends and young people complain about their problems and challenges. But if you turn the idea on its head, work is about solving problems. If everything in this world works perfectly, people wouldn't need to work at all because there are no problems. Also important for entrepreneurs is what Jack often says: You have to have to be passionate about and like what you do. Don't just do things for the result, like making money. That doesn‚Äôt take you very far. It's more important that you believe and feel passionate about a dream. What is your definition of an entrepreneur? In my view, entrepreneurs are people with dreams. They believe in something, are willing to own up to responsibilities and create results. An entrepreneur might say that they will build a plane that can fly. Other people would say they'd believe that only once they see it flying. The difference between an entrepreneur and someone that's not is one needs to see the results before believing, while the other one has a dream and creates the results. Why is supporting entrepreneurship especially in times of crises? Entrepreneurship has always been important. It's just that the pandemic has given rise to extraordinary circumstances. I've always believed that people have two arms for a reason: One arm is for building your business, dream, family, children and wealth, while the other is for helping others ‚Äì your friends, business partners, community, country, people and the world. In a speech I made at a UN fundraiser for tsunami response in 2005, I asked the audience ‚Äì including some national leaders in attendance ‚Äì to imagine the human collective as a person's body. If any part of the body is hit by a virus, and if it's ignored, it will sooner or later affect the entire body. That metaphor was a thought that came to mind while meditating. I couldn't have imagined that mankind today would face a devastating pandemic. We are all learning. At a time like this one, it's meaningless to keep fighting, blaming and undermining one another. Only when every cell and organ works together to solve the issue would the body be healthy.

"266",5365,"https://www.psychologytoday.com/za/blog/culturally-speaking/201111/why-african-americans-avoid-psychotherapy","Why African Americans Avoid Psychotherapy","Overnight, a young woman‚Äôs personality shifts, plunging her into a months-long medical mystery. Verified by Psychology Today Posted November 2, 2011 | Reviewed by Jessica Schrader African Americans share the same mental health issues as the rest of the population, with arguably even greater stressors due to racism, prejudice, and economic disparities. Meanwhile, many wonder why African Americans shy away from psychotherapy as a potential solution to challenges such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, marriage problems, and parenting issues. As a black psychologist, it is troublesome that so many African Americans are reluctant to make use of psychology's solutions to emotional hurdles. Here are some of the issues I've encountered in my research and clinical practice, with practical ideas for addressing this disparity. In places like Los Angeles and New York, everyone and their pet has a therapist, yet even among the wealthy and elite, many African Americans continue to hold stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness. For example, a qualitative study by Alvidrez et al., (2008) found that among Blacks who were already mental health consumers, over a third felt that mild depression or anxiety would be considered ""crazy"" in their social circles. Talking about problems with an outsider (i.e., a therapist) may be viewed as airing one's ""dirty laundry,"" and even more telling is the fact that over a quarter of those consumers felt that discussions about mental illness would not be appropriate even among family. In a study I recently completed, one African American gentleman noted, ""I was just embarrassed. Getting this type of help has, and continues to be, like a sore thumb in the African American community. Unfortunately, I don't have insurance, so my fear was that if I sought help, it would not be good because I couldn't afford it."" Likewise, African Americans may be resistant to seek treatment because they fear it may reflect badly on their families‚Äîan outward admission of the family's failure to handle problems internally. Something I found in my own studies is that even among African Americans who suffered greatly from mental disorders, many held negative attitudes about people who obtain mental health care. No matter how impaired they were, they didn't want to be one of ""those people."" Many African Americans with mental disorders are unaware that they have a diagnosable illness at all, and are even less aware that effective psychological treatments exist for their specific problem. Because of the taboo surrounding open discussion about mental illness, African Americans often have little knowledge of mental health problems and their treatments. Many African Americans also have concerns about treatment effectiveness, which may be due to both lack of education and cultural misgivings. Apprehension about clashing with the values or worldview of the clinician can cause ambivalence about seeking help, and this may be especially true for the many who believe that mental health treatment was designed by white people for white people. African Americans view the typical psychologist as an older, white male who would be insensitive to the social and economic realities of their lives (Thompson et al., 2004). In actuality, however, even though African Americans are underrepresented as psychologists, they are well-represented among mental health providers in general, and can be found among the ranks of master's level clinicians, such as professional counselors and clinical social workers. These types of therapists can be very useful for many sorts of difficulties, including family problems and many mental health needs. Anxiety about therapy may also be related to a lack of knowledge about what to expect from the treatment itself. Indeed, many African Americans with mental disorders express fears about being involuntarily hospitalized, and are unwilling to share their symptoms for fear of being ""locked up"" or ""put away."" Yet even those who are willing to brave treatment may not place therapy among their priorities. Work, family responsibilities, commitments, and transportation issues all can overshadow the need for therapy, which may be viewed as a luxury endeavor when there are kids to drive to little league and dinner to make at home. This troublesome reality suggests that despite struggling for years with a mental disorder, many are reluctant to take time for themselves to get better. The financial burden of mental health treatment is a barrier that affects everyone, but disproportionally affects African Americans due to lower incomes and reduced employment opportunities. In my own research, I found that those most concerned about cost are more likely to be uninsured; their incomes are not low enough to qualify for publicly provided services but not high enough to afford a private insurance plan. All of the issues described thus far can create a difficult uphill battle when trying to increase treatment participation within the African American community. But there are many practical approaches that can reduce this mental health disparity. The cost of treatment may be prohibitive for many, especially among those without insurance coverage. Many low-income individuals can find help in the community health system, but such systems may suffer from a lack of clinicians able to treat complex and less common conditions. It can be especially difficult to find care for those who lack any sort of insurance, have an unstable living situation, or who must contend with the inability to make appointments due to overcrowding. Individual practices and treatment centers can help by publicizing effective low-cost treatment options (i.e., practicum students, sliding-scale slots, etc.) Another cost-effective option is stepped-care. For example, one model proposed by Tolin, Diefenback, Maltby, and Hannan (2005) for the treatment of OCD involves bibliotherapy (self-help books), followed by clinician-guided self-treatment as needed, as well as traditional exposure and ritual prevention for non-responders. In this way, the most expensive treatment is provided to those who need it most, while others may benefit from a lesser approach. Nonetheless, it is important to be aware that the cost of treatment is a larger problem that involves many aspects of our society, including the politics of health care and social inequalities. Education about mental disorders and the treatment process is critical to reducing barriers to treatment among the African American community. Suggestions for overcoming this barrier include public education campaigns (e.g., mass media), educational presentations at community venues (e.g., black churches), and open information sessions at local mental health clinics. In fact, many black churches are taking the treatment to where the people are and hiring licensed therapists to work with their flock. For those who do start conventional treatment, the first clinical encounter presents an important opportunity to address skepticism about the usefulness of treatment. It's the clinician's responsibility to demystify the process and explain the benefits of staying the course. Without this knowledge, the participant may only assume what he or she may encounter and base their decision to follow through on incorrect assumptions. If the expected outcomes, number of sessions, and potential goals are clearly outlined in advance, there is little chance of feeling misled or not in control. The client-patient bond may be strengthened with this extra attempt at transparency. Treatment has the potential to conflict with many daily activities or commitments for busy people. In the current economy, many take second and third jobs to make ends meet. Whether the individual feels treatment is a necessary priority despite prior engagements, transportation, or scheduling issues is an important positive step. Moreover, incorporating the family is another crucial measure in overcoming barriers to treatment. By gaining familial support, the client may gain peace of mind as well as lose the fear of being outcast or stigmatized. In addition, with the family's acceptance, making time for treatment becomes easier and priorities may be put into perspective. Utilizing the family to emphasize the importance of good mental health creates more allies to emphasize the relationship between improved functioning and greater success at home and work. Making psychotherapy less intimidating may be one of the most important ways of improving help-seeking. Careful use of language can help to reduce some discomfort surrounding mental health care. For example, African Americans are more comfortable with the term ""counseling"" over ""psychotherapy"" (Thompson et al., 2004), and this should be considered in advertising and conversational exchanges. Another practical way to reduce fears is to offer free assessments and phone consultations, which will help familiarize potential patients with the clinic, clinician, and treatment. Clinicians might use initial contacts to address fears of being involuntarily hospitalized by explaining the difference between typical mental health challenges and ""being crazy,"" including the role of insight and self-efficacy. However, it is important to note that reservations against treatment may be rooted in actual experiences of racism and encounters with medical professionals lacking cultural awareness. Treatment is a partnership that can only be successful with mutual respect, and for this to occur it remains the duty of the therapist to become culturally competent and sensitive to disparities, and in turn, communicate support and understanding to the patient. African Americans look for subtle cues to determine if a therapist holds racist attitudes, as many are afraid of being mistreated due to their race or ethnicity. These concerns are not unfounded, as a lower social status makes African Americans more vulnerable to abuse, particularly in a medical setting, where the clinician is considered the authority figure. A recent study by Snowden et al. (2009) found that after controlling for severity of mental illness and other variables, African Americans are more than twice as likely to experience a psychiatric hospitalization than whites, an indication of continued bias among clinicians when faced with black patients in need of mental health services. To completely eliminate mental health disparities, clinicians must be willing to undertake an honest self-examination of their own conscious and unconscious attitudes about race, including preconceived notions about who would be a good client. By increasing the cultural competence and social awareness of all clinicians, the mental health system can begin to shed its bias against ethnic minorities. This would result in greater understanding and empathy for the patient's experience, improved treatment outcomes, and more African Americans willing to take a chance with mental health care.

Take a look. Conditions & Treatments Conditions & Treatments by Peter Urban, AARP, June 9, 2020 Getty Images En espa√±ol | Just in 2015, racial disparities in cancer mortality rates cost the African American community an additional $3.2 billion in lost earnings compared with whites, according to a report released in June from the American Cancer Society. The study, led by the organization's public health researcher, Jingxuan Zhao, used national cancer death and life expectancy data from 2015 to determine ‚Äúperson-years of lost life‚Äù by race. Researchers then used federal statistics on annual median earnings to calculate lost earnings. For African Americans on average, each cancer death resulted in 19.7 years of lost life and $232,600 in lost earnings. For whites, the average was 17.2 years of lost life and $175,600 in lost earnings. In 2015, the disparity meant the African American community had an additional 241,334 person-years of lost life and $3.2 billion more in lost earnings than the white community, according to the study.

""Since the 1960s, black men and women have had higher cancer mortality rates than their white counterparts,‚Äù says the study, published June 3 in the medical journal JNCI Cancer Spectrum. ‚ÄúCancer disparities by race/ethnicity [also] vary at the regional level in the United States, illustrating the importance of state and local policies."" To address the disproportional economic burden that African Americans face, the study suggests the importance of improving equal access to effective cancer prevention, screening and treatment. A higher percentage of white females undergo a mammography for breast screening compared with black females, the study noted. Black and Hispanic women diagnosed with breast cancer are at greater risk of having a one- to three-month delay in the start of treatment. And black women were less likely to receive radiation therapy after undergoing breast-conserving surgery. The study also noted the importance of bringing more racial and ethnic diversity into the workforce that specializes in oncology and increasing health insurance coverage to minority populations. ""The burden of many of these cancers could be reduced through improving access to effective, high quality and targeted cancer prevention, screening and treatment for these vulnerable populations,‚Äù the researchers say. ‚ÄúBroad, equitable application of strategies to address these issues will be essential for reducing the economic burden associated with racial/ethnic cancer disparities.""

"268",5414,"https://theafricanhistory.com/800","Saartijie Baartman from Khoisan was exhibited for her large buttocks in Europe | The African History","Sarah Baartman was born in 1780, her names were Saartjie or Sawtche or Ssehura which means diminutive form. Was from the Khoikhoi nomadic ethnic group that lived in the eastern region of the Cape Colony in present day South Africa. Sarah was 4 ft 7in tall. Sarah‚Äôs life was lined with difficulties. Her mother passed away when she was only two years of age. Her father who was a cattle driver also died when she was a teenager. The mother of Sarah belonged to South Africa‚Äôs oldest tribe, the Khoi. Khoi Khoi women‚Äôs skin tone was lighter and their hips were well built. The hips developed in the tribe of Sarah ‚Äòs mother were at that time a sign of beauty. Sarah‚Äôs difficulties compounded after a Dutch Doctor called William Dunlop purchased Sarah from her employer, an Afrikaans farmer and employed her in his house a domestic help in Cape Town. At that time, Sarah had grown large buttocks known as steatopygia in medical term. It is a condition in which a woman or sometimes even a man builds up huge tissue on the buttocks and thighs. The sides and front of the thighs often involve the accumulation of the fat. Therefore a curvy figure is created in the Khoikhoi women. In women of Sub-Saharan African descent, pygmies from central Africa and the tribe Onge from the Andaman islands, the genetic characteristic of steatopygia can also be found. Unfortunately, this physical state caused her fascination with the early nineteenth century white European colonizers. They have therefore made their biggest error by categorizing Sarah or Saartjie Baartman as a sub-human individual and using her physically. Dunlop, who was then employed by the Royal Navy, had been using Sarah for a while in Cape Town as his slave and sex servant. He and his partner a mixed-race entrepreneur called Hendrik Cesars took Sarah to London in 1810. From there they changed her name to Sarah or Saartjie. Dr. Dunlop and Cesars once convinced Sarah in London that if they exposed her body, she would become wealthy. Innocently, she accepted without doubt. Dunlop and Cesars then organized freak shows throughout England for the next few years and exposed her out in all cities of the Kingdom and the Netherlands. Sarah was treated like an animal, they made her walked, stood, sat or danced unquestioningly. White people could see her with stupefaction, astonishment, disgust and amusement. Both men and women touched her. In the meantime, scientists and doctors began to explain Sarah‚Äôs anatomy in all sorts of concepts. Sarah was the victim to the inferiority of the Black race, and she endured a illness in some way. She suffered macronymphy because of the abnormality of Sarah‚Äôs sexual organs, scientists said. But that was her natural normal body. A group which supported Sarah was formed by Robert Wedderburn, a young Jamaica activist against racism and slavery. Robert Wedderburn also put legal pressure on the British government to stop such freak exhibitions. In 1814 Cesars took Sarah to Paris to avoid such pressure. There she was presented at numerous venues like a circus. She was called Hottentot Venus, or Black Venus, meaning a khoikhoi. During private meetings, Sarah was slowly and certainly forced into pro sti tution. She was treated as a real object of s*x in such gatherings. Also at time, Sarah was used as the subject of studies by zoologist and operator Georges Cuvier. Georges Cuvier was also the Napoleon Bonaparte surgeon. The professor of zoology was also the manager of the French National Museum of Natural History. Sarah was most definitely the missing link between man and animal, according to Georges Cuvier. It is assumed that Georges Cuvier had requested permission to research on Bushman‚Äôs woman with greater precision. Upon his study, the professor compares Sarah‚Äôs face with an orangutan, then says her stocks look like female mandrills. How Sarah Baartman died Sadly, Sarah Baartman died at the age of 26 in Paris on 29 December 1815. She died horrible, ashamed and sick. She was suffering from pneumonia and/or syphilis and also from alcohol at the time of her death. The professor dissected her body soon after her death. Prior to that, he made Sarah‚Äôs body of plaster cast. He then showed in Paris Sarah‚Äôs remains. In 1817, he presented his research at the Medical Academy. The Black Africans were also reported to be perpetually inferior according to his study. Up later in 1975, the Paris public had been exposed to genitals, the brain, the skeleton and a plaster cast from the body. Nelson Mandela was declared South African President in 1994 and demanded Sarah ‚Äòs remains from the French Government. The controversy of Sarah Baartman‚Äôs remains Unfortunately, the French government denied initially. They approved the request in March 2002. The remains of Sarah Baartman were buried about 192 years after she had left her nation in the area of her birthplace in Eastern Cape on August 9, 2002. Many books on the treatment and cultural significance of Sarah have been published over several years. Sarah‚Äôs life and times were covered in the 2010 film ‚ÄòBlack Venus,‚Äô as well as the 1998 documentary ‚ÄòThe Life and the Times of Sara Baartman. There are many more details about the life of Sarah that remain unknown and unconfirmed. The harm done on Sarah can not be repaired today. The least we can do is call ample bravery to speak the bare truth that could comfort her soul. You have to remember that maybe she was the first Black woman to be a trafficked victim.

These trends are expected to exacerbate existing humanitarian challenges in Africa, such as floods, droughts, East Africa‚Äôs worst Desert Locust outbreak in 70 years, and to significantly impact food security. African countries are now faced with the challenge of how to swiftly and effectively scale preventive approaches to reduce the immediate risk that COVID-19 poses to people‚Äôs health and, further, the short and long term negative implications to existing markets, livelihoods and food systems. During this time of disruption, mass digital platforms have shown their ability to be agile in their adaptation and response, helping to solve complex challenges. Digital platforms have evolved from the early-stages of connecting buyers and sellers for simple transactions (such as the pioneering mobile money service, M-Pesa which was launched by Vodafone Group and Safaricom in 2007) into multi-sided platforms that bring together consumers, service providers and stakeholders to facilitate value exchange as part of a larger ecosystem. Picture rights: Safaricom One such platform is DigiFarm, Safaricom‚Äôs agriculture service in Kenya. The platform highlights the important digital links keeping the economy going in such rapidly changing times. DigiFarm offers farmers one-stop access to a suite of products, including financial and credit services, quality farm products and customised information on farming best practices, all from the most basic phone. So far, DigiFarm has over 2.5 million farmers enlisted to the service, and its approach has won awards, notably GSMA‚Äôs best innovation for emerging markets. Safaricom has ambitious goals and plans to reach 5 million farmers in Kenya through DigiFarm by 2023, with the potential to bring the DigiFarm model to other countries through Vodafone partners. This mass market approach to delivering services to smallholders through a curated set of partners integrated under one platform may provide a blueprint for other digital platforms to follow. For example, Vodacom Tanzania recently launched a new digital platform for farmers, m-Kulima, incorporating lessons from the region, including DigiFarm. A key approach to developing digital platforms is to work with best-in-class partners with detailed knowledge about farmers‚Äô needs to help in the product design, and other organisations (for example input, financial and information providers), offering tailored services through the platform, that farmers can pay for through their mobile phones. Other digital platforms have also shown great potential during this time of disruption and crisis. AgriFin is taking the lead in the creation of a digitally-enabled integrated response to the twin problems of Desert Locusts and COVID-19, using WhatsApp for business and machine learning capabilities, SMS and call centres, in coordination with promotion over weekly agricultural TV shows, chat groups, newsletters and content providers. This platform, piloted and rolled out in Kenya, is a public resource open to all in the country. Discussions are underway about how to integrate this model into Safaricom, ensuring maximum utility and spread of the service, as well as laying the foundations for future crisis response tools. In the coming months Safaricom and Mercy Corps AgriFin will continue to look at ways to collaborate to see if there are any adaptations which will help build farmers‚Äô resilience using digital and data-led approaches to be as accurate and safe as possible. With the next planting period looming, digital crisis response solutions need to be adaptive to farmers‚Äô needs and new challenges during this time. The complex interplay of crisis - from COVID-19, to Desert Locusts, to the climate emergency - is creating a unique operating environment in Africa; digital platforms are well placed to offer solutions to some of these complex challenges.

So when the trailer for Beyonc√©‚Äôs new visual album emerged on Twitter with imagery Bassey found stereotypical ‚Äî face paint, feathers, animal skins ‚Äî the Nigerian college student responded with images of highways, skyscrapers and yachts. ‚ÄúThere is this constant joke that Africans wake up and see animals running around,‚Äù said Bassey, 19, who studies international relations in the southwestern state of Ekiti. ‚ÄúPeople are so surprised to know that we go to the spa.‚Äù At a time of global reckoning over race and representation, the 70-second trailer for ‚ÄúBlack Is King‚Äù ‚Äî a film inspired by the superstar‚Äôs work on the 2019 ‚ÄúLion King‚Äù remake ‚Äî has sparked backlash abroad. The project is set to the soundtrack that Beyonc√© produced last year, which features artists from Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and Cameroon. ‚ÄúI believe that when Black people tell our own stories, we can shift the axis of the world and tell our REAL history of generational wealth and richness of soul that are not told in our history books,‚Äù Beyonc√© wrote in an Instagram post. The events of 2020 ‚Äî the renewed focus on police killings, the death of George Floyd ‚Äî make that message more relevant, she added. (The singer recently wrote an open letter to Kentucky‚Äôs attorney general urging him to charge the officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor.) ‚ÄúI wanted to present elements of Black history and African tradition,‚Äù Beyonc√© said on Instagram, ‚Äúwith a modern twist and a universal message, and what it truly means to find your self-identity and build a legacy.‚Äù A debate ensued in the comments. ‚ÄúThis narrative is getting boring,‚Äù one user wrote. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt wake up with white chalk on our faces or live in blue huts.‚Äù Another added: ‚ÄúAfrica has grown beyond what you just incorporated, Beyonc√©.‚Äù Some pointed out that Disney Plus, which will begin streaming the visual album on July 31, is not yet accessible in African nations. Others noted that Beyonc√©‚Äôs last three tours reached Europe, Australia and South America but not Africa. (She has played a handful of shows on the continent, most recently at a charity event in Johannesburg in 2018.) The contention follows years of frustration over Western media‚Äôs frequent depiction of Africa as a homogeneous entity, said Stephanie Boateng, a British Ghanaian filmmaker in Accra. The continent has 54 countries and myriad cultures ‚Äî Boateng has spent months researching 17th-century Ghana for a film project ‚Äî and creators with noble intentions can miss important nuance. ‚ÄúWe have this beautiful vision, this piece of art,‚Äù Boateng said of Beyonc√©‚Äôs trailer, ‚Äúbut it might show a broad representation of the continent without actually streaming over here.‚Äù The performer‚Äôs publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, did not respond to requests for comment. Beyonc√©‚Äôs mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, defended ‚ÄúBlack Is King‚Äù on Instagram, highlighting that her daughter worked closely with creative partners from Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa. ‚ÄúMy point in posting this is simply that those who are criticizing the film (before they even see it) saying it‚Äôs unauthentic, upset that B doesn‚Äôt actually go to Africa or say that Bey is simply using African cultures for gain are wrong because 1. She makes less with her Afrocentric content,‚Äù she wrote. ‚Äú2.

While people whine about her not touring in Africa yet beg for more African representation in entertainment but are mad that they're getting it from one the world's greatest stars is strange to me.

The 43-year-old rapper, who had previously expressed support for President Donald Trump, said earlier this month that he no longer backs the president and announced plans to run for the White House. Despite initial reports that he had dropped out of the race after missing the registration deadlines in multiple states, West is continuing his presidential bid, hoping to win as a write-in candidate in those states where he missed the deadline for appearing on the ballot. At his North Charleston event Sunday, West touched on a wide range of issues, from abortion and welfare to the pharmaceutical industry, gun ownership, and tax policy. Among other things, West advocated a return to agrarianism and the undoing of the industrial revolution. ""When I talk to the billionaires, another white billionaire to be specific. When we moved to the city it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with and now it is time to move back again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get tax breaks."" ""Telsa, the original Tesla, said the Earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family from the Earth, Wind, Water, and Fire."" ""But the education and the schools... Have you ever had a textbook tell you you can buy 500 acres for $100,000 in middle America and build a farm and feed your family. Has there ever been a class on that? Would you agree there is a reason there's never been a class like that?"" West drew jeers from the crowd when he criticized Harriet Tubman, an abolitionist and former slave who helped dozens of slaves escape the South to freedom in the North. Denying Tubman helped free slaves, West claimed she ‚Äújust had them go work for other white people.‚Äù She ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt free the slaves.‚Äù Later in the event, West decried abortion, saying that his father had pressured his mother to have him aborted, adding that his daughter had almost been aborted as well. ‚ÄúMy mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.‚Äù But when asked whether he supported banning abortion, West said the practice should remain legal, instead favoring massive financial incentives to women who carry their children to term. West suggested women should receive a million dollars for each child, saying the plan could be implemented globally, suggesting that Israel could fund the program in Africa. ‚ÄúEverybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something in that range.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will fund it with other countries,‚Äù West added. ‚ÄúAmerica with other continents. There are Israeli continents that do not believe in this. There are African continents that do not believe in this.‚Äù ‚ÄúIsrael in Africa - that would fund a concept like this.‚Äù Turning to the Second Amendment, West said gun ownership rights were important in preventing Americans from being ‚Äúenslaved‚Äù by China and other foreign countries, and touted armed Israeli women as an example of widespread gun use. ‚ÄúShooting guns are fun,‚Äù West said. ‚ÄúIsraeli women know how to fire a firearm, they are trained how to do it.‚Äù  ","none","none",0,0,0,0

The women, two 21-year-olds and a 19-year-old, have been charged with fraud and lying to health officials to evade quarantine. Two of the three have since tested positive for COVID-19. Police are investigating whether the young women were coached by an organised crime syndicate to cover their tracks at the border. African Australian woman Fortune Ruzvidzo said the women did not represent the community and public focus on race was not helpful. ""It has been a very racially charged conversation, instead of the focus being on the health of Queenslanders,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""When their faces were put out there and everyone could see that clearly these women were African ‚Ä¶ there were a lot of racial comments that were put out there. ""Their actions should be seen based on them as individuals, not on their race. ""People were expressing their anger, rightfully, but then they started attacking who they were and speaking of deporting them and things like that."" At the beginning of pandemic, Asian-Australians were verbally and physically assaulted, refused service, received death threats and had their properties damaged. Following her own post to Facebook venting her frustration about the racially charged comments, Ms Ruzvidzo said she received threats in her private messages. She said the comments on social media directed at the three women alienate and ostracise the entire African Australian community. ""Because when people are saying 'they should be deported', 'they should go back to where they came from', it's an attack on the whole community,"" she said. ""I think for all African Australians you start to question your own identity here in Australia."" Active cases: 38 Latest information from Queensland Health. The identity of two of the women was revealed by News Corp newspapers before they had been charged by police, and subsequent republication in the media is the subject of robust discussion across social media. Member for Rankin and Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers said he was concerned about further ramifications. ""The argument is that in doing that [publishing the women's identity] it is a deterrent for people doing the wrong thing,"" he said. ""But what worries me about that is that we don't want that to be a deterrent to people getting tested. ""Hopefully that publication of those women's names and photos doesn't get in the way of that.""

"275",5618,"https://www.okayafrica.com/netflix-new-south-african-horror-film-8-review/","Netflix√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨Àú8√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Is a Win for South African Horror","Review: With films like '8', it appears the South African film industry may be ripe for a folk-horror renaissance. The recurring words spoken in Harold Holscher's new Netflix horror 8 are ''moths'' and ''worms.'' These things are weaved into the film's horror infrastructure, not necessarily as elements to gross out viewers, but as allegories about death and transfiguration. Coming off the back of previous shorts that embrace dark themes, 8 arrives on Netflix as Holscher's full-length feature debut following its film festival run. The South African writer-director goes for high impact, pushing this South African folkloric chiller into the creepiest, darkest places. Whether or not 8 succeeds in doing this is a question that might annoy horror die-hards looking for more inventive scares. Establishing atmosphere and tone right away, the opening frame shows a sickly, pale-faced elderly man lying in bed, he then reclines into his death when a mysterious man and his evil spawn of a companion come to take his soul. Considering this happens in broad daylight, the scare is rather effective. Holscher, using low camera angles to reveal the intruder, casts him as nothing more than a dark, faceless silhouette‚Äîa shot that highlights the director's technical dexterity.  What happens after this is a new beginning: William (Garth Breytenbach) and his wife Sarah (Inge Beckmann), along with their adopted daughter Mary (Keita Luna) arrive at a farmhouse which belonged to his just-deceased father in 1977. The family's arrival carries tonal echoes of pre-existing horror productions where houses are haunted (Poltergeist, The Conjuring) and others which eventually spiral into disintegration and domestic decay (The Shining, Pet Sematary). We are keenly aware that Williams happens not to be suspicious of his father's death.  His wife Sarah, all aristocratic steel and high jaw, on the other hand feels something isn't right about Lazarus (Tshamano Sebe), the stray-looking man who has befriended their daughter out of nowhere. Lazarus is baked in dirt, hair riotously shaggy, body screaming for a bath. But he's no ordinary man. He's a sangoma in a pact with a demon called Uthuli, reincarnating with the body of his dead daughter and lords over Lazarus to deliver souls to him. The creature design is remarkable ‚Äì talons, sharp teeth, crooked back ‚Äì and matches the sheer, asymmetrical grotesqueness of Guillermo del Toro's monsters. Mary, who's on the cusp of adolescence, is caustically articulate and maintains a morbid interest in the supernatural. Maybe that's why she and Lazarus are drawn to each other, weaving around themselves creepy fantasies of pet silkworm burials and pinkie friendship pledges. More importantly, they find in each other the phantoms of people they have lost. For Mary, it's her parents. For Lazarus, it's his family, his daughter dying in a fire after his wife died during childbirth. At William's request, Lazarus is sheltered in the yard. Sweet and soft-spoken, William tries to check all the boxes of a good husband. Here, in their new bucolic environment teeming with trees and winding foliage, William is carved into shapes of handy, sweaty physical masculinity: bulb fixing, wood chopping, generator servicing. All the while, Sarah's paranoia about Lazarus heightens. 8 | Official Trailer | Netflix www.youtube.com 8 utilises horror to examine human nature and the complicit participation of our destruction. Are we who we say we are? Can we confront our own inner demons? While the film's piece-by-piece exposition sums the motives of its characters nicely, never once overwhelming the viewer, the plot does run into pockets of inertia with its severely slow pacing. The characters, especially Mary, spends too much time drifting around the yard, and without any payoff. Sarah mostly hides herself away in the sombre cavity of the house, letting her disapproval of Mary's association with Lazarus swallow her whole. When she speaks, her sentences are clipped and often roll out as an order. With William around, their marriage doesn't seem to have a nourishing, emotional core, almost flattened by larger plot influences. The plot itself doesn't unravel any kind of strains in their relationship or festering resentment, only that Sarah can't have a child of her own. The film's trailer had a strong, visceral imagery with high emotional stakes, but juxtaposing it against the full duration, the horror beats feel muted and under-developed. On other accounts, 8 is carried by the drawn-out tics of Tshamano's acting, who shifts from bloodless, demon-controlled killer to guilt-ridden pariah. The final moments where Uthuli comes for Mary's lily-white innocence might be borderline absurd, it serves bits of South African witchcraft and the existential riff between good and evil. Circling back to the year again, 1977, Holscher supplants his horror picture in a South Africa still steeped in apartheid, where its black and white characters maintain skeletal interactions poisoned with extreme caution. Through this framing of time, Holscher smuggles in ugly nostalgia and perhaps drawing our attention to how modern South Africa still retain strains of segregation. South African horror cinema has turned a corner since 1989's seemingly low-budget Hellgate‚Äînow with more texture and sophistication as seen in postmodern offerings like The House on Willow Street (2016) and Rage (2020), Showmax's first Original horror movie. The tonal similarity between The Tokoloshe (2018) and 8 is perhaps a signal that South Africa's film industry is ripe for a folk-horror renaissance, and the world might just be ready too.","none","none",0,0,0,0

Africa correspondent @sparkomat Sunday 19 July 2020 08:36, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Funerals in South Africa are grand events that require time and money to organise - plenty of which could be seen as we pulled up to the Shweme Zilamkhonto funeral parlour in Port Elizabeth. On the forecourt, workmen were cutting and polishing tombstones, while a fleet of sporty-looking funeral wagons were loaded up with bodies out the back. Three victims of COVID-19 were on the morning's burial schedule. I watched the funeral director's employees - dressed in full biohazard suits - as they placed one plastic-wrapped coffin in the back of a Ferrari-red hearse. The coffin was then taken to a windswept cemetery in the township of Motherwell, which sits and sprawls on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, and I witnessed the men in protective suits deposit the box in a freshly-dug hole. A small group watched on from a distance as a man called Diamond told me they were saying farewell to a 58-year old woman called Joyce Moni. There was no music, prayers or fellowship to honour this mother-of-four, and the men standing in the group of onlookers were too scared to approach the grave site. COVID-19: Scotland to phase out coronavirus face mask laws in April COVID: Bereaved families call for coronavirus memorial wall to be made permanent Partygate: Boris Johnson to face scrutiny from senior MPs as COVID rule-breaking scandal re-emerges I asked the director of the funeral parlour, Mandla Herdashe, if he could explain. He said: ""The people are so afraid of the virus, they are discriminating [against] their own, you know. ""When you pay last respects, you get to close the hole, you throw a piece of soil, but with this pandemic nothing of the sort happens, it is very sad."" There were some who thought South Africa would be spared the worst of the global pandemic, but the virus has taken root, spreading rapidly through the country's densely populated townships. In fact, South Africa has become the world's fourth-largest source of daily cases of COVID-19, with health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize simultaneously warning of a ""coming storm"" and a serious shortage of essentials like hospital beds and compressed oxygen. Port Elizabeth is the largest city in the Eastern Cape province and it has become clear that the community's poorly managed health system has begun to buckle. At Motherwell Hospital, residents told us they started queuing at 2am for coronavirus tests and medication for long-term illnesses. It was here that people bunched up and fought with each other when staff began to let them through the gate. Any thought of social distancing was abandoned in the rush for treatment. I spoke to one elderly man who had been caught up in the commotion. He said: ""This is terrible, sick people are getting sicker, some are dying on their legs now. It's hurting me, it's hurting, what are our people doing about this?"" Despite having months to plan for outbreaks, authorities are struggling in the Eastern Cape. Staff at the region's largest COVID-19 treatment centre, Livingstone Hospital, described crippling staff shortages caused by sickness. The facility is poorly kept with medical waste spilling out of storerooms and grime-covered beds cluttering the corridors. The lack of space in the critical care wards means dedicated physicians like Dr Tobisa Fodo have to make agonising decisions about who receives treatment. ""It is heartbreaking in the sense that you end up - you and your team - having to say no to somebody's mother, somebody's grandmother, somebody's father, somebody's uncle,"" he said. When I asked him about a rough number of rejections, he added: ""We will accept around about 25% of the referrals so maybe the other 75% are not going to get a bed."" Jane Cowley, a dynamic opposition parliamentarian for the Democratic Alliance party, took us to a former Volkswagen car factory in Port Elizabeth which has been transformed into an impressive-looking field hospital with 1,400 beds. With support and funding from Volkswagen and the German government, this facility was created in just seven weeks -but Ms Cowley pointed out that the recruitment campaign to staff it had only begun at the end of June. :: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker At the moment, the field hospital is home to just 40 patients. ""Let's hope they do get those staff in place within the next week to 10 days,"" she said, admitting this was a hopeful expectation rather than a realistic one. Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane has called for emergency assistance after revealing the province's health system is overwhelmed. The South African military has provided 75 doctors and nurses, and the US government has offered 50 ventilators. But despite these extra resources, the people of the region remain scared and there is little confidence in those who have been appointed to protect them. ¬© 2022 Sky UK","none","none",0,0,0,0

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump directly appealed to African American voters for their vote, asking them, ""What do you have to lose?"" Trump should have received more credit for this, as Republicans have often been criticized for not wooing African Americans from Democrats, who crucially depend on their overwhelming support yet take their votes for granted. Trump's message was that Blacks had entrusted their improvement exclusively to the Democratic Party, but it had failed to produce. He highlighted two critical areas in which Democrats had let them down: education and poverty. TRUMP SAYS BIDEN LISTENING TO BERNIE'S 'RADICALIZED PEOPLE,' DRIFTING 'FURTHER LEFT' He said that Blacks ""are living in poverty"" and their ""schools are no good,"" and he pledged to do better by them, unlike Democrats, who offered nothing but empty promises. The Democrats have never bothered to show how their policies are superior to the Republicans' because they can't. Instead, they've cynically cast Republicans as uncompassionate and, in many cases, racist. I've always assumed their scheme worked, because I can find no other explanation for the Democrats' electoral vice grip on African Americans than the latter's distrust of Republicans. Nothing else makes sense. It's no coincidence that Democrats have played the race card with even greater intensity in response to President Trump's undeniable policy successes for African Americans and other minorities. Under Trump, African American unemployment was at a record low, and their wages were greatly improving prior to the virus-induced downturn. Democrats always cite the same phony examples to make their case, such as that Trump is an immigration hawk because he doesn't like Mexicans and other non-Americans. It's all bogus, but it works, and it sure beats having to explain away their own policy failures and Trump's policy successes. It is despicable and destructive. Falsely accusing people of racism is a particularly egregious sin, not just because there are few smears more harmful to one's reputation but also because it damages race relations, especially when the slander, like the sin of racism itself, is applied with a broad brush to an entire group of people -- in this case, the Republican Party. But why fool ourselves? The Democratic Party isn't going to change anytime soon on this score, as evidenced by Joe Biden's ghastly remark that African Americans not supporting him aren't Black. As such, a good friend of mine suggested to me that President Trump must follow up on his 2016 challenge to African American voters. Normally, I'm reluctant for Republicans to target African Americans or other specific voter groups because it smacks of race consciousness and identity politics, and could be seen as patronizing and pandering, none of which has ever stopped Democrats. But as sensitive as the race issue has become, and as much as Democrats have painted Trump and Republicans as racist, it's time this is addressed head-on. Now he has a concrete record to tout, but he needs to sharpen his message to demonstrate how his policies were actually lifting African Americans out of poverty, and how the Democrats' active neglect of Black children in inferior inner-city schools has doomed many of them to lives of poverty, violence and crime. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Trump is particularly suited to this task because he has fulfilled his campaign promises to African Americans and he speaks from the heart, avoiding the double speak used by many politicians. President Trump must accentuate the economic and education issues on which he campaigned, but he should also point to the civil unrest, crime, lawlessness and anarchy that dominates our cities today, and tailor his law and order agenda to Black families who crave domestic tranquility as much as anyone else does. Cities are imploding throughout the nation under mostly Democratic leadership, and they are inflamed with violence. Trump should turn the tables on Democratic politicians and make them answer for their abject policy failures and explain why they turn a blind eye to Black lives lost to inner-city violence. Black families living in these troubled neighborhoods surely want law and order and peace and liberty as much as anyone else, despite the activists' exclusive focus on instances of police misconduct. As for these rogue cops, which are a very small minority, it's time that Democrats explain their unwavering support for the police unions that protect them. African Americans understand that defunding the cops would be disastrous, yet the Democrats' answer is less law enforcement rather than more, which guarantees more arson, looting and death. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump should demand that Democrats answer why they aggressively oppose charter schools, school choice and other initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education for all people. Here again, are the Democrats working for African Americans or teachers unions? My friend is right. President Trump, please take your case directly to African Americans and contrast your record with the Democrats' incendiary and opportunistic rhetoric, and failed policies. Point out that, in fact, African Americans have very much to lose by supporting a party that has no answers for them, and that would enable more lawlessness and ensure greater inequality of outcomes.

"282",5811,"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/10/uks-windrush-scandal-seeing-it-lose-influence-across-african-continent","UK's Windrush scandal seeing it lose influence across African continent","By contrast China is seen as a partner across much of Africa, offering itself as a growth model Britain‚Äôs treatment of the Windrush generation and attitude to its colonial past means it is struggling to retain the same influence across the African continent as China, a cross-party group of peers has said. In a new report, sharply critical of a lack of a clear UK government strategy for Africa, the Lords International Relations and Defence Committee said the Home Office‚Äôs treatment of Africans seeking visas to the UK was close to humiliating. Following a six month inquiry into UK relations with Africa, the peers warned that ‚Äúthe UK‚Äôs domestic policies affect how it is perceived in sub-Saharan Africa. The Windrush scandal and the ‚Äòhostile environment‚Äô have damaged the UK‚Äôs reputation‚Äù. They also warned the UK‚Äôs historic engagement with Africa had had a lasting impact on its relationships in the region, and that it had to be more open about its negative aspects, ‚Äúincluding ongoing tensions over the history of how it colonised many countries in Africa, and in some countries its role in the slave trade‚Äù. The committee was told by Lady Amos, the former UN official and Labour peer, that the UK would have ‚Äúan ongoing problem ‚Ä¶ in our relationship with a number of African countries‚Äù until the UK acknowledged ‚Äúthe important role that the slave trade played in building Britain, and its consequences for the dehumanisation of people from the African continent‚Äù. By contrast China is seen as a partner across much of Africa, offering itself as a growth model for other sub-Saharan countries. Overall the peers found the UK‚Äôs Africa strategy falling short, saying much of it was vague, full of jargon or part of a continuum in which the Foreign Office committed to making Africa a priority and then, in the face of competing demands, failed to do so. Although the UK Foreign Office has increased staff serving in Africa, and has set a new priority in the Sahel, once a French preserve, the peers pointed out there had been 20 Africa ministers in the past 31 years, an average tenure of 18 months. The peers said they were surprised to hear that no detailed work had yet been done to identify ways in which the UK could offer better access to African exporters than was possible when the UK was in the EU. The bulk of Britain‚Äôs post Brexit trade work is focussed on Asia and the US. Plans for the UK to become the top G7 investor in Africa by 2022, a target set out by Theresa May in 2018, have been quietly dropped by the current prime minister in favour of the UK becoming Africa‚Äôs partner of choice, the committee noted. The current Africa minister James Duddridge told the committee that the target had been crass since ‚Äúas Africa expands massively, the cake expands more‚Äù. China was ‚Äúeating up a lot more of that investment opportunity than before‚Äù, which made hitting such a target ‚Äúharder and harder‚Äù, he said. In one of the report‚Äôs strongest passages the peers said: ‚Äú[The] UK‚Äôs visa policies are damaging its reputation and the ability of international departments to build and strengthen relationships across Africa, and in some cases fall below the standards of basic human decency. One witness described the process as ‚Äòarbitrary, expensive, time-consuming and ‚Ä¶ humiliating‚Äô.‚Äù A government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThe UK is determined to build strong partnerships with countries across Africa that will boost trade and prosperity, improve security and stability and tackle climate change. ‚ÄúThe UK-Africa summit earlier this year saw 21 countries from across the continent join forces with the UK and commit to working even more closely together to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. ‚ÄúThe new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office will build on the success of the summit and bring these development and diplomatic efforts closer together.‚Äù","UK","none",0,0,0,0

Nobody really knows the actual answer to that question, but his campaign has begun nonetheless. Things have already gotten off to a rocky start at his first event in Charleston, South Carolina, and now he may be dealing with some very serious problems in his personal life. According to a report from Us Weekly, Kanye‚Äôs wife, Kim Kardashian, has begun contacting lawyers about a divorce, after his controversial remarks made at the event and in the following days on his Twitter account. However, Kardashian later made a post on her Instagram page asking for privacy and compassion, and discussing her husband‚Äôs mental health issues. His family was reportedly so concerned about his mental health as they were watching the rally, that they wanted to have him committed to a mental hospital immediately after his speech. West made a wide range of controversial remarks at his event, but most upsetting to his family was the revelation that he initially wanted to abort one of their children. West became extremely emotional and broke down into tears during that part in his speech. ‚ÄúMy dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would‚Äôve been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy,‚Äù West said, before shouting, ‚ÄúI almost killed my daughter! I almost killed my daughter!‚Äù Photo: AP In the discussion about abortion, West advocated for a strange policy where mothers would be paid $1 million to have a baby, even mothers in other places like Africa, and that Israel should pay the bill. The idea is that it would encourage women to keep their babies without making abortion illegal. Many people noticed that his comments were strangely similar to Donald Trump‚Äôs promise to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. ‚ÄúEverybody that has a baby gets a million dollars or something in that range. We will fund it with other countries. America with other continents. There are Israeli continents that do not believe in this. There are African continents that do not believe in this,‚Äù he said.  Kanye West launches bid for presidency From abortion, to civil rights figure Harriet Tubman, Kanye West's rambling speech launched his bid to become president.https://www.itv.com/news/2020-07-20/kanye-west-runs-for-president-with-million-dollar-babies-among-campaign-ideas Posted by ITV News on Monday, July 20, 2020 West made a variety of other strange comments, including that Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, ‚Äúshe just had the slaves go work for other white people.‚Äù After getting home from the event, West launched into a tirade on Twitter where he admonished his family for attempting to get doctors to ‚Äúlock him up.‚Äù Many of the posts have since been deleted.  Kanye‚Äôs friends were very concerned about his mental health, and he ended up getting some unexpected visits from people like Dave Chappelle. West posted an awkward video on Twitter where he is coaxing Dave Chappelle into telling a joke. https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1285627821424087040 Elon Musk also reportedly talked to West and said that ‚ÄúHe seems like he‚Äôs doing fine.‚Äù West has been very public about his struggle with bipolar disorder. In 2016, he spent time in the hospital after a ‚Äòpsychiatric emergency‚Äô in the middle of a tour that forced him to cancel 21 shows. Trump Signs Executive Order Blocking Undocumented Immigrants From Census Chicago Shooting At Funeral Leaves 15 People Injured Mark Horowitz is a graduate of Brandeis University with a degree in political science. Horowitz could have had a job at one of the top media organizations in the United States, but when working as an intern, he found that the journalists in the newsroom were confined by the anxieties and sensibilities of their bosses. Horowitz loved journalism, but wanted more freedom to pursue more complex topics than you would find on the evening news. Around the same time, he began to notice that there was a growing number of independent journalists developing followings online by sharing their in-depth analysis of advanced or off-beat topics. It wasn't long before Horowitz quit his internship with a large New York network to begin publishing his own material online. Published on By This article was originally published On Dec 3, 2020 Colombia is one of the most notorious producers of cocaine in the world, despite the fact that the country has gone to great lengths in hopes of diminishing the trade of the drug trade within its borders. Now, some members of the Columbian government are proposing a new approach. They are calling for the drug to be legalized and for the government to take control of the industry for themselves. In a new bill first proposed earlier this year, senators Iv√°n Marulanda and Feliciano Valencia call for the Colombian government to take total control of the cocaine industry to bolster public funds and cut violent cartels out of the trade. In a recent interview with VICE, Marulanda explained that the government would purchase coca at market price from the 200,000 farming families that are believed to be involved in the trade. Columbia is considering a bill that makes the government buy up and sell the country‚Äôs cocaine production. HOLY. SHIT. So instead try to stamp out drugs, Columbia tries to take control of the trade and regulate the problem? https://t.co/8SBmE45dmX ‚Äî Jason Ng (@ByJasonNg) December 2, 2020  The senators argued that it would actually be cheaper for authorities to buy the crop from the farmers than it would for them to destroy their crops. It costs the government roughly $1 billion every year to destroy coca crops, while it would only cost about $680 million to buy it. ‚ÄúThe thing is, we have to recover control over the state. We‚Äôre losing control of the state to corruption, narcos in politics. They‚Äôre in municipalities, in departments and in congress. All the way to the highest echelons of government,‚Äù Marulanda explained. From here, the state would supply cocaine to users and research groups looking to study its use for painkillers, but it would not be sold recreationally. However, cocaine use is already legal in Columbia, after a court ruled that personal consumption was a human right. Marulanda is not sure if his bill will make an impact, or how long it will take to gain traction, but he is hoping to make it a major election issue in 2022. ‚ÄòThe first big obstacle is to open up the conversation among public opinion. This has been a giant taboo. Colombians are born and raised under this assumption that drug-trafficking is a war. There‚Äôs no information about coca and cocaine. So, with this bill we hope to open the conversation,‚Äù he explained.  In recent years, the government has stepped up their military-police-style enforcement of the industry, and yet cocaine production continues to grow in the country. Coca cultivation reached 212,000 hectares last year, a rise of nearly 2% from 208,000 hectares the year before, according to figures released by the White House in March. Potential pure cocaine production, meanwhile, rose to 951 metric tons, an 8% increase, according to the Associated Press. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty remarkable that they manually eradicated 100,000 hectares last year and didn‚Äôt move the needle,‚Äù Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America think tank said earlier this year. ‚ÄúI guess it means replanting has at least kept pace.‚Äù It seems that no matter what the government does, the cocaine keeps on coming, so politicians are willing to try things that may drastic. However, as Marulanda pointed out in his interview with Vice, cutting out the criminal middlemen will reduce the violence seen in the country‚Äôs drug war, and also make the drug safer for the people who use it. UPDATE: Historic win for coca/cocaine regulation Bill in Colombian Senate ‚Äì 22nd April 2021 Published on By It is well-known that the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein kept detailed records of all the powerful people that he stayed in contact with. There is a notorious ‚Äúlittle black book‚Äù that was published by Gawker in 2015, which exposed many of the powerful people in his circle. This book is believed to contain the contacts that he most frequently called around 2004 and 2005. However, a new list of contacts, recently published by The Insider, reveals new names that were friends with Epstein in the 1990s. The new black book has the names of 349 people, many of whom did not appear in the list that was previously released to the public. Among the names on the list are Suzanne Ircha, who‚Äôs married to Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, famous wall street investor Carl Icahn, supermarket owner John A. Catsimatidis, actress Morgan Fairchild, former New Republic owner Marty Peretz; and Cristina Greeven, the wife of CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. The new black book was made public through a strange twist of fate. A woman initially found the book in the late 1990s and saved it for many years until she finally sold it on eBay.  Denise Ondayko, the woman who found the book, said she was walking down Fifth Avenue in the mid-‚Äô90s when she spotted a black address book on the ground. She said that she didn‚Äôt realize it was Epstein‚Äôs book at the time, because he was pretty much unknown to the public, but she did realize that it had a lot of famous names and figured that it might be worth something, so she held onto it. Last year, Ondayko was cleaning out an old storage unit where she was keeping some of her things and she stumbled upon the book. Now that Epstein was all over the news, the information contained in the book was much more obvious to identify. Ondayko said she reached out to everyone in the media that she could, including John Oliver, Rachel Maddow, and The New York Times, but none of them ever got back to her, so she eventually just put it up for sale on eBay. The buyer was Chris Helali, an aspiring politician from Vermont. He purchased the book for $425.  Helali also tried reaching out to the media, including journalists that were already reporting on Epstein, but none of them seemed interested. Finally, Nick Bryant, the reporter who wrote the original Gawker black book story forwarded the book to the Insider who decided to publish. Insider hired Dennis Ryan, a former forensic document examiner and laboratory supervisor for the Nassau County Police Department, to verify the authenticity of the book. Ryan says that the book is definitely from the late 90s, and many of the dates and addresses match up perfectly with Epstein‚Äôs properties and known contacts at the time. The Insider also reached out to dozens of contacts listed in the book who had never previously been publicly associated with Epstein. Fourteen acknowledged on the record that they knew or had met Epstein in the ‚Äô90s. There are over 120 names that appear in both books, including Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. Some of the other names included, Steve Rattner, Beth Anne Bovino, Dominique Bluhdorn, Jill Harth, Ted Field, Robert Nunnery, Stanley Shopkorn, Steve Ruchevsky, Ellen Susman, William and Ann Nitze, Les Gelb, Ron Daniel, Sandy Warner, Cyril Fung, Marius Fortelni, Michael Cutlip. Many of these names aren‚Äôt necessarily famous, but they are very powerful people in business and finance. The address book is now available in a searchable database on the Insider, but it is unfortunately hidden behind a paywall.  Published on By Last week, former actor Bill Cosby was released from prison on a technicality, despite the fact that he admitted to drugging and assaulting multiple women, and was accused by many others. After his release, legal experts warned that the ruling could set a dangerous precedent that attorneys in similar cases would use to get their clients released as well. Now, just a week later, Ghislaine Maxwell‚Äôs lawyers are arguing that she should have her case thrown out on the same grounds, according to The Guardian. Cosby was released because the prosecutor involved initially didn‚Äôt press any charges, and claimed that Cosby would not be facing any legal trouble, so when Cosby later confessed, his confession was called into question and no longer admissible in court. The judge also ruled that Cosby had no chance of a fair trial because evidence that was not admissible was so freely available in the media that the jury was unable to make a judgment without considering those facts. Photo: AP Maxwell‚Äôs case is similar because the first time that Epstein was arrested for human trafficking, he was given a sweetheart deal by Alex Acosta, a friendly prosecutor. The deal helped Epstein avoid any serious jail time, but it also gave him and his associates legal protection from being held accountable for any future crimes. Obviously, it is not possible to shield a criminal from the consequences of actions that they will take in the future, so Epstein was arrested again many years later after it was discovered that he continued his crimes long after his initial arrest. If Epstein and his friends did have any kind of immunity from that deal, it ended when they continued to commit crimes after the deal was made. Still, Maxwell‚Äôs lawyers are optimistic after Cosby‚Äôs recent release.  ‚ÄúThe government is trying to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she was granted immunity,‚Äù Maxwell‚Äôs lawyers wrote in a statement to Judge Alison Nathan. However, the judge has previously ruled that the deal did not apply to the current case. In an opinion piece for the New York Daily News, Maxwell‚Äôs attorney David Oscar Markus wrote that releasing Bill Cosby from prison was the right decision, and that Ghislaine Maxwell should be released as well. Markus argued that prosecutors should have to keep the promises that they make to suspects, because people will sometimes incriminate themselves if they think they have immunity. However, many times prosecutors are corrupt and make promises that are against the best interests of the public, as we saw in Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs first ‚Äúsweetheart deal‚Äù with Alex Acosta while he was district attorney in Southern, Florida.

The National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla John Sitole, said authorities responded quickly to the mayhem. ‚ÄúI am certain that the speedy response by the joint security forces has averted what could have been a more severe blood bath,‚Äù Sitole said in a statement Saturday, according to I24 News. The news outlet described the building as a ‚Äúmega-church.‚Äù ‚ÄúFour people were found shot and burnt to death in a car while a fifth victim, a security guard, was also fatally shot in his car while he was apparently attending this complaint,‚Äù Sitole added. An armed group stormed the International Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zuurbekom, located near Johannesburg. The police chief said that they were trying ‚Äúto take over the premises.‚Äù Officials said they don‚Äôt believe a terrorist organization is responsible, but they ‚Äúmay have been motivated by a feud between conflicted parties of the church,‚Äù ABC News reported. Police officials said they rescued multiple men, women, and children who were said to be living inside the church compound and were allegedly being held as hostages. Sitole added: ‚ÄúIt is rather unfortunate that such an incident takes place during a time when South Africa is being plagued by a deadly virus and violent crimes,‚Äù referring to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In 2018, according to I24, there were reports of a shoot-out between two parties outside the church‚Äôs headquarters in Zuurbekom. A power struggle over the church‚Äôs leadership started after its former leader died in 2016, according to local news outlet IOL. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve arrested all those we reasonably believed are suspects. They have been taking [sic] in for questioning,‚Äù said police spokesperson Vish Naidoo to the BBC. #sapsGP Early hours this morning #SAPS was alerted to a hostage situation & shooting @ International Pentcost Holiness Church, Zuurbekom, 30 suspects arrested & seized more than 25 firearms. 5 fatalities are confirmed.

By Gordon Froud I have known Antoinette since she was an exceptional student at the then Wits Technikon in Jhb. Her work as a student was best known through her iconic series of wedding dresses made entirely out of tissues, embroidered, smocked and exquisitely sewn together as a statement around women and the roles they are required to play. Her solo exhibitions at the Civic gallery, Spark and most recently at Circa continued the themes of the role of women and the perceptions of women in society. Her work was skilfully made, charted new material uses (like the use of tape measures, felt or carpeting as a medium) and was loaded with social commentary often with a sharp and acerbic sense of humour and wit.  I got to know her better when she was appointed as curator/ manager of the Civic Gallery where she came into her own as an administrator and feisty champion of the arts within the Civic Theatre complex where she fought for the gallery to remain open. (This sadly is no longer so). Later on, Antoinette took over the running of the Jhb Artbank ‚Äì an initiative that I had helped to get off the ground. Sadly, again this did not get the local government support that it needed and was closed down and sold off. She fought hard to make this work but lost out to the powers that be. All the while, she was making her own art and raising two beautiful daughters. She showed on group exhibitions at Gordart Gallery (which was my space at the time) and other spaces in Jhb and taught at various tertiary institutions like LISOF Fashion Design College. When the Chief curator position opened up at JAG, Antoinette was appointed and her fight for the arts continued. She engaged with Jhb city officials in every possible way to repair the aging building, she worked on policies for the collection and supported the Friends of JAG in their efforts to raise funds and provide money for acquisitions. Her days became increasingly frustrated taken up by endless city council meetings and lobbies on behalf of JAG. Because she was an opinionated fighter, she bore the brunt of antagonism from many in these meetings who made their fight personal. In spite of this, she was able to get funding to initiate various phases of the roof and building repairs that are still ongoing to this day. These fights took their toll on her mental and physical self, culminating in her resignation while at breaking point. This resulted in her publishing a scathing open letter about her experience at JAG. Her health suffered as did her state of mind. After a self- imposed break, she started making artwork again and engaging with the art world through her work with Stephan Welz and Co auctioneers as a consultant. Sadly, her situation worsened to a point where she was isolated again. My last engagement with her was her contribution to the Ampersand Foundation Award 21st Anniversary exhibition at the University of Jhb Art Gallery that I curated in September 2019. At that point she was already frail and disoriented. She remained fairly reclusive from that point onward and only really engaged with family and close friends by telephone. It was with shock that we learned of her succumbing to COVID related complications. I pay tribute to her talent as an artist, her role as a mother and a feisty fighter for the art world in South Africa. Antoinette leaves behind a legacy that will be continued by her daughters Zoey and Mia.

"297",6048,"https://www.jbklutse.com/uber-partners-with-moove/","Uber partners with Moove: Easier vehicle ownership for African drivers","JBKlutse Uber has today announced a partnership with Moove, sub-Saharan Africa‚Äôs first flexible car ownership company, to provide potential and current Uber drivers in sub-Saharan Africa with long-term access to vehicles. The largest partnership of its kind, the collaboration aims to lower existing barriers to car ownership on the continent and empower drivers to be their boss within a shorter time frame. Moove‚Äôs partnership with Uber across sub-Saharan Africa will provide riders with access to newer car models when they request a ride. As part of an ongoing commitment to safety and particularly in the current fight against COVID-19, Moove cars are fitted with transparent and perspex partition screens to separate the driver from rear and passenger seat riders. Director of Business Development in MEA, Justin Spratt says, ‚ÄúWe are passionate about delivering better experiences for drivers and are therefore excited to partner with Moove to develop meaningful, customised solutions for drivers in sub-Saharan Africa. Through this partnership, drivers‚Äô livelihoods will be meaningfully improved while enabling them to get into the driver‚Äôs seat when it comes to their own future.‚Äù Speaking on the partnership, Managing Partner of Grace Lake Partners and Co-Founder of Moove, Mr Ladi Delano, said: ‚ÄúThe launch of Moove and our sub-Saharan Africa wide partnership with Uber will empower Uber drivers across the continent by providing them with a clear and affordable path to high-quality car ownership.‚Äù Table of Contents The partnership with Moove introduces low-barrier entry methods into the Uber app by offering improved pricing models for car ownership through solutions such as flexible rental and drive-to-own options. The multiple ownership methods are designed to suit drivers with diverse budgets and goals, ultimately reducing the risk of defaulted payments. For instance, the flexi-rental option provides short-term vehicle access, that spans between one to four weeks, while drive-to-own options are available to drivers with 24, 36 and 48-month agreements respectively. In a bid to improve vehicle standards and safety across Africa, a number of safety enhancements have been made to all Moove vehicles which include improved geofencing and tracking, as well as mandatory monthly car servicing and inspections at the service centre. Critical support to drivers is also provided to ensure that the agreements on financing remain feasible, while Uber offers drivers 24/7 in-app assistance on any issue or query experienced. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), ‚ÄúInclusive, safe, and affordable transportation is crucial for women. Without inclusive transportation, women are denied their right to move freely in public spaces and are less likely to find good jobs. Women face barriers both as passengers and transportation service providers, ranging from underrepresentation across the sector to widespread safety and security concerns.‚Äù While the transport industry has traditionally been male-dominated, Uber‚Äôs partnership with Moove will ensure that 50% of drivers are women, empowering them whilst also providing peace of mind when it comes to safety. All Moove vehicles come with a standard safety tool kit which includes perspex and transparent partition screens between the driver and rider, while hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes will be provided and a face mask/ covering must be worn at all times when on a trip. This partnership is imperative for all in the transport industry, whether they are on the Uber platform or not, as with the advanced technology and redesigned entry methods, the opportunity to become an entrepreneur is now more accessible and affordable. It reaffirms Uber‚Äôs commitment to West Africa and Africa as a whole, by providing enhanced earning potential and better mobility for all.

The Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the Bronx Zoo in addition to three other zoos and an aquarium in New York City, said in a statement this week that in the ""name of equality, transparency, and accountability, we must confront our organization's historic role in promoting racial injustice."" The society cited its treatment of a young Central African man from the Mbuti people in the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo. ""His name was Ota Benga,"" the statement said. Bronx Zoo officials ""put Ota Benga on display in the zoo‚Äôs Monkey House for several days during the week of September 8, 1906 before outrage from local Black ministers quickly brought the disgraceful incident to an end."" One of those ministers, the Rev. James Gordon, ""arranged for Ota Benga to stay at an orphanage he directed in Weeksville, Brooklyn,"" the statement said. ""Robbed of his humanity and unable to return home,"" Ota Benga died by suicide a decade later. Harvey Blume, who co-authored the 1992 book ""Ota Benga: The Pygmy At The Zoo,"" said the zoo's apology is too little and too late. ""And to whom was this apology? It's a little late for Ota,"" Blume told NBC News on Friday. All known records about Ota Benga at the wildlife society are now being made available online as part of an effort to ""publicly acknowledge the mistakes of our past,"" the Wildlife Conservation Society's statement said. The organization, founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society, also denounced the ""eugenics-based, pseudoscientific racism, writings, and philosophies"" advanced by two of its founders, Madison Grant and Henry Fairfield Osborn, Sr. Grant penned an infamous eugenics book, ‚ÄúThe Passing of the Great Race,‚Äù with a preface by Osborn. The book was submitted as a defense exhibit for Nazi doctor Karl Brandt, a director of the Third Reich's ""euthanasia"" program, and other defendants in the Nuremberg trials. Brandt, who was also Adolf Hitler's personal physician, was convicted by the war crimes tribunal in 1947 and put to death in 1948. ""Back in that day, science and anthropology were based on explicitly racist principles,"" Blume said. ""That there was a hierarchy of races, culminating with the white race on top, looking down."" The role once-respected scholars played in propping up debunked scientific theories to justify white supremacy has been overlooked for far too long, according to the author. ""Madison Grant was one of Hitler's favorite authors,"" said Blume, who co-authored ""Ota Benga: The Pygmy At The Zoo"" with the late Phillips Verner Bradford, grandson of the man who purchased Ota Benga in Africa and brought him to America. ""These were not Nazis, but in some ways they were too."" The wildlife society said in its statement, which was first reported by The New York Times, that it is obligated to confront these episodes. ""We deeply regret that many people and generations have been hurt by these actions or by our failure previously to publicly condemn and denounce them,"" the statement said. ""We recognize that overt and systemic racism persists, and our institution must play a greater role to confront it. As the United States addresses its legacy of anti-Black racism and the brutal killings that have led to mass protests around the world, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that social, racial, and environmental justice are deep-rooted in our conservation mission."" The organization also announced it was hiring a diversity officer to help ""ensure diverse pools of candidates for recruitment, promotion, and succession planning, including our board and leadership."" ""Today we challenge ourselves to do better and to never look away whenever and wherever injustice occurs,"" the statement said.

(NYSE: PNC) today announced a commitment of more than $1 billion to help end systemic racism and support economic empowerment of African Americans and low- and moderate-income communities. ""We are living in one of the most important civil rights movements of our time. Each of us has a role to play in combatting racism and discrimination, and PNC is committed to driving real change in areas in which we can make the greatest impact,"" said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer William S. Demchak. PNC has a long history of supporting economic empowerment efforts. The company has earned an ""Outstanding"" rating under the Community Reinvestment Act since those examinations began more than 40 years ago, and has been nationally recognized for the impact of PNC Grow Up Great¬Æ, a bilingual multi-year initiative launched in 2004 that helps prepare children from birth to age 5 for success in school and life, with a particular emphasis on helping children, families and others in diverse and low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. PNC's expanded commitment, announced today, will provide more than $50 million in additional charitable support for national and local work that will help eliminate systemic racism and promote social justice; expand financial education and workforce development initiatives; and enhance low-income neighborhood revitalization and affordable housing, with funding allocation led by the PNC Foundation Board of Directors, PNC's Regional Presidents and Community Development Banking teams. PNC's commitment also includes more than $1 billion in community development financing and capital for neighborhood revitalization, consumers and small businesses; enhancements to PNC's existing matching gift program to include support for qualifying non-profit organizations that support economic empowerment and social justice educational efforts; and a commitment to fully engage PNC employees in support of qualifying social justice and economic empowerment non-profits through volunteerism, with up to 40 hours paid time off annually to do so. ""This is about much more than writing a check. This is about PNC doing what it does well ‚Äì putting our capital to work in the communities we serve and providing innovation through products and services, with a special focus on helping African Americans buy homes, which we recognize is an important factor in wealth accumulation,"" Demchak said. ""We are also going to make a positive impact through employee volunteerism. We've seen incredible success from our employee volunteerism through our Grow Up Great program, and that's what we're going to do here as well. ""Today's announcement is just one step toward PNC furthering its commitments and building on the meaningful work that the company has done in this space,"" Demchak said. ""Diversity and Inclusion are fundamental tenets of PNC's culture. We are also committed to an intensified focus on the recruitment, retention and advancement of African American talent; a more comprehensive and sustained effort to create a more inclusive culture at PNC; and a focus on internal systems to improve racial equality. ""Within our own company, we are having more candid, transparent and quite frankly, more difficult conversations about the challenges facing our black colleagues and customers and what we must do to change that,"" he said. ""We have a responsibility to act ‚Äì a responsibility to each other, our clients, communities and shareholders. We need to seize this moment and use our voices, our influence and our resources to address racism, discrimination, bigotry, bias and economic and health disparities that plague our country."" Demchak said this includes recognizing the role that democracy plays in the fight for social justice, citing PNC's contribution earlier this month of $200,000 to the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in support of the organization's work to ensure voting access for all communities, particularly African Americans and other voters of color; and PNC's role as a signatory to Time to Vote ‚Äì a nonpartisan coalition of U.S. companies working to increase voter participation.
