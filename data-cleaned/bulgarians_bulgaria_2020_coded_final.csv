Celebrations will take place across the country, BNT reported. In many places in the country, together with marking Botev’s birth, church celebrations will be held for water blessings of the military units and flags, which will be followed by the ceremony for retrieving the cross from rivers on Epiphany. Celebrations to mark Hristo Botev’s birth will take place in his birth town of Kalofer, in Sofia, Stara Zagora, Plovdiv, Haskovo, Blagoevgrad, Veliko Turnovo, Varna and Burgas. Botev was born in Kalofer in 1848. His father was a teacher and one of the most significant figures in the late period of the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1863, after completing his elementary education in Kalofer, Botev was sent by his father to a high school in Odessa, where he studied for 2 years. During this period, his ties to the Russian revolutionary movement and his political views began to form. In 1867, he returned to Kalofer to teach in place of his ill father. In May, he made a public speech against the Ottoman authorities, which led to his exile and move to Romania seeking asylum. From 1869 to 1871, Botev worked again as a teacher in Bessarabia, keeping close relations with the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and its leaders. In June 1871, he became editor of the revolutionary emigrant newspaper ""Word of the Bulgarian Emigrants"", where he published early poetic works. He closely collaborated with the Russian revolutionists and worked for the Russian newspaper Svoboda (Liberty). In 1873, he worked on the satiric newspaper “Alarm Clock” and published political fiction aimed at wealthy Bulgarians. He continued to write poetry with themes such as revolutionary zeal and freedom, with two of his more famous poems being, “In the Tavern” and “My Prayer”. After the outbreak of the 1876 April Uprising, which had the goal to liberate Bulgaria from the five-century Ottoman rule, Botev began organising a troupe to enter Bulgaria and help the rebels. On 30th of May, 1876, Botev and part of the troupe seized a ship and re-entered Bulgaria from Romania near Kozloduy. Hristo Botev was killed on 1st of June 1876. Since his death, many streets, cities and landmarks have been named after the revolutionary, including “Botev Point”, “Botev Peak”, and “Botevgrad”. A football stadium in the South Bulgarian city of Plovdiv was named “Hristo Botev” in 1961 and is home to the professional football club “Botev Plovdiv”.

Accountant Stoyanova does not live in an isolated backwater, but around 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the capital Sofia. She is at the sharp end of a crisis which has led to the environment minister being charged with mismanagement and forced to resign. It also prompted a parliamentary vote of no confidence on Wednesday in the government -- which it survived. But the scandal has fed public anger at the failures of those running the EU's poorest country. The western Bulgarian city of Pernik should have a plentiful supply of water from the nearby Studena dam. However, the reservoir there is practically empty, with most of the bed now lying exposed. Pernik residents meanwhile are receiving murky, undrinkable water -- and even that only between 4pm and 10pm (1400-2000 GMT). For three months now, the daily routine for 36-year-old Stoyanova and her electrical engineer husband has revolved around the shortage. ""When we get back from work at 7pm, we run to take a shower and try to wash everything before 10pm,"" she explains, with buckets and containers being filled before the taps run dry. ""I try to cook with mineral water, I wash dishes with it and of course I only drink mineral water,"" says 56-year-old Adelina Ivanova, who has to haul the bottles up seven flights of stairs. ""The meaning of your life in a given day is: 'Will I manage to take a shower?', and being so happy when you do,"" Ivanova says. ""It's absurd for a civilized person to be reduced to that."" - 'Corruption, not climate' - Bulgaria has had a drier winter than normal and during 2019 received 25 percent less rainfall than average, in what was the second-hottest year on record. But residents are clear on where they place the blame for the crisis. ""We are victims of negligence and corruption, not the climate,"" sighs 67-year-old Ivan Dragov, who used to work in the area's water distribution network. Prosecutors accuse the former Environment and Water Minister Neno Dimov of ignoring warnings about the falling water levels at the reservoir, as well as continuing to allow a local steelworks to draw water from it. ""Thirty years ago, around a dozen businesses were operating in the area and the water level was monitored daily,"" says Dragov, adding that there were no shortages for residents back then. Pernik's former mayor has also been charged with abuse of power over her refusal to enforce rationing during her campaign for re-election last autumn -- which she went on to lose anyway. On Saturday, hundreds of residents took their anger to government headquarters in Sofia, shouting ""resign!"", ""killers!"" and ""Mafia!"" - 'Bottomless barrel' - The crisis in Pernik has also thrown a spotlight on Bulgaria's dilapidated water infrastructure, which results in around 60 percent of water being lost through leaks. In Pernik, the pipes date from the 1960s and 70s and the losses can reach up to 75 percent. The new Environment Minister Emil Dimitrov has compared the network to a ""bottomless barrel"". The leaks leave up to 315,000 people -- in a country of seven million -- facing regular water shortages, particularly in summer. The government has said that cutting down on these losses is a priority, and has pledged 900 million euros ($990 million) to renew this infrastructure in the next two years. However, the total cost of bringing it up to scratch is estimated at six billion euros. If the situation in Pernik does not improve, authorities have warned that water could run out completely by April. Even to maintain the current six hours of daily supply, the government is having to divert water from another reservoir, with 13 kilometers of pipes still needing to be installed to complete the link. As for Stoyanova, the crisis has only confirmed her bleak opinion of her country's situation. She is encouraging her daughters, aged 5 and 9, to learn English. ""They don't have a future here.

With 14.0% of employed people usually working from home in 2018, the Netherlands topped the list of EU Member States, closely followed by Finland (13.3%), Luxembourg (11.0%) and Austria (10.0%). In contrast, very few people usually worked from home in Bulgaria (0.3%) and Romania (0.4%). In the EU, the self-employed usually worked from home (18.5%) more often than employees (3.0%).

Although a large proportion of respondents are concerned about the possibility of a global epidemic and the possible spread of the virus in Bulgaria, just under half of those surveyed feel personally threatened. This explains why half of the respondents have not taken any precautionary measures so far. The Nielsen Admosphere Bulgaria survey was conducted among active internet users participating in the Bulgarian National Panel from February 3-17, 2020. The panel is part of the European National network operating in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. A similar type of coronavirus study was also conducted in these 4 countries. Most of the Bulgarians (82%) came across news regarding the new coronavirus that appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, and has infected tens of thousands of people so far. In recent weeks, there have been conversations for a global threat, prompting many countries to take various measures, such as the cancellation of direct flights from China and the installation of thermal cameras at airports. 71% of Bulgarians are worried about the possibility of a global epidemic - women (80%) are more worried than men (62%) as well as younger age groups. About 80% of people between the ages of 15 and 44 share a concern about this. For comparison - 65% of the people over 45 share these concerns. The concern that the virus could start spreading in Bulgaria is a little higher - 75%, with women again expressing a stronger attitude towards men on this issue, along with the younger ones up to the age of 44. Just under half of the respondents gave a positive response to the question whether they actually feel threatened by the coronavirus. This seems to be a result of the lack of confirmed cases of infected in Bulgaria so far. However, half of the people still do not consider it necessary to take preventative measures in relation to the spread of the virus. However, 30% of respondents are considering taking some action in the near future, and 20% have already taken some measures, such as wearing a mask in public and increased compliance with personal hygiene.

Bulgaria's confirmed cases more than doubled to 52 over the past few days with a nine-year-old child from Britain becoming the latest confirmed coronavirus infection on Monday. Two people have died from the infection. The country has declared a state of emergency until April 13, closing schools and banning mass gatherings. Thousands of people in the capital Sofia and dozens of other cities stood at their balconies shining lights from their mobile phones in a display of support for the medics following an appeal on social media.

Thanks to the St. St. Cyril and Methodius brothers, it is symbolic for the Bulgarian language, spirituality and culture. In the past Thessaloniki was a cosmopolitan eastern city which people compared to Izmir, Beirut, Alexandria and Constantinople. It was called “Madre de Israel” because of the numerous Jewish community, “the capital of Macedonia” because of its central role in the life of the region, “the city of Kemal Ataturk” because the founder of modern Turkey was born there, “the capital of the Greek refugees from Asia Minor and Pontus” for sheltering them since 1922. The strategic geographic location of the city and the important role of its port for trade and cultural exchanges in the region made of it a true metropolis in which different religious, ethnic, and national groups coexist. In recent years the memory of this pivotal, historically multinational character of Thessaloniki is reviving. Apart from being Levantine, Thessaloniki was also a Balkan city that has left a lasting trace in Bulgarian cultural and historical memory. Bulgarians also have left their mark on this cosmopolitan city. Historically, Thessaloniki was the model city for the Bulgarian population of the province, the ‘lamp’ for generations of Bulgarians from Macedonia. And while losing its Levantine appearance, it still remains an attractive center for the economic and cultural initiatives of the Bulgarians, their close and desirable destination for recreation and entertainment.

As Republika wrote, Maleski “continues to denigrate Macedonia and the Macedonians.” “A few days ago in a column he stated that Macedonians and Bulgarians were one people and that the Ilinden Uprising was an ordinary ‘revolt; of the Bulgarian population. Maleski in a statement to Bulgarian media now says that Gotse Delchev and Krste Petkov Misirkov were Bulgarians,” said Republika. “When asked by the journalist what Gotse Delchev and Misirkov were, Maleski said that there are no doubts that they were Bulgarians,” meaning not “Macedonians.” So what was the Ilinden Uprising? The Ilindin Uprising was a Bulgarian revolt in the land we now call “North Macedonia” against the Ottoman Empire for independence, or at the very minimum, autonomy. Despite historical revisionism from the usual suspect, there is little doubt that Delchev considered himself and his revolutionary comrades as Bulgarian and not a mythical separate “Macedonian.” Delchev is known as one of the most important figures in the Bulgarian struggle in Macedonia against the Ottomans. See Also: Watch video of Turkish coastguard trying to direct boat with illegal immigrants into Greek waters Misirkov was another figure who identified as Bulgarian, but had conflicting thoughts on whether Macedonia should join Bulgaria or remain independent. In another scathing statement that sent Republika into a frenzy, Maleski said “We are past the time when Macedonian history was protected by the powerful Yugoslav federation and could, without pressure, selectively choose the building blocks of the Macedonian nation, and could cross out the mentions of ‘Bulgarian’ and write ‘Macedonian’ instead”.

Moreover, overcrowded environments can present a higher risk of spreading the virus. On the other hand, staying home alone for days on end brings its own set of challenges as well. In the EU, more than one in three persons (33.0%) lived in under-occupied dwellings in 2018, meaning that the dwellings were deemed to be too large, in terms of excess rooms and more specifically bedrooms, for the needs of the household living in it. Overcrowding rate falling slightly in countries with the highest rates Among the EU Member States, almost half the population in Romania (46.3%) were living in overcrowded households in 2018. This was also the case for around two in every five persons in Latvia (43.4%), Bulgaria (41.6%), Croatia (39.3%) and Poland (39.2%). Compared to the previous year, the share of the population living in overcrowded dwellings fell slightly in all of these countries except Latvia (+1.5 percentage points), with the strongest fall recorded in Poland (-1.3 pp). At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest overcrowding rates were recorded in Cyprus (2.5%), Ireland (2.7%), Malta (3.4%) and the Netherlands (4.1%). The share of young people and children that live in overcrowded dwellings is much higher than for the elderly. In 2018, almost one quarter (24.1%) of people aged 18 year or less lived in overcrowded dwellings in the EU, while only 6.9% of those aged 65 years and older did. In particular, 40.2% of young people in the EU who were living in households at risk of poverty were also living in overcrowded dwellings, Eurostat data shows. Seven in ten persons living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta, Ireland and Cyprus In 2018, almost three quarters of the population were living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta (73.4%), Ireland and Cyprus (both 71.4%). In Belgium (58.6%), Spain (56.3%), the Netherlands (53.9%) and Luxembourg (53.7%), more than half of the population were living in dwellings deemed too large. From 2017 to 2018, the largest drops in share of the population living in under-occupied dwellings were recorded in Luxembourg (-1.8 percentage points), Denmark (-1.7 pp) and Sweden (-1.0 pp). In contrast, less than 15% of the population were living in dwellings deemed to be too large in Romania (7.3%), Latvia (9.9%), Greece (10.4%), Bulgaria (11.5%), Croatia (11.6%), Slovakia (12.7%), Poland (14.4%) and Italy (14.9%). Close to half of the people aged 65 year or older (46.9%) in the EU were living in under-occupied dwellings in 2018. This was the case for a vast majority of elderly people in Ireland (92.8%), Cyprus (87.4%) and Malta (86.7%), while relatively few elderly lived in dwellings with too many rooms in Romania (12.0%), Latvia (13.3%), Croatia (16.9%) and Poland (17.8%).

Seventy per cent of Bulgarians polled in an Alpha Research poll want public parks and gardens open for visits by everyone, while 61 per cent favour an end to intercity travel restrictions. The results of the poll, done for Bulgarian National Television’s Referendum talk show, were announced in the April 28 evening broadcast. Forty-eight per cent of those polled saw the opening of kindergartens and primary schools as a priority. Overall, 54.1 per cent wanted fewer measures against the spread of Covid-19, but over a longer period of time. In contrast, 43.8 per cent favoured more measures, but over a shorter period of time. About 2.1 per cent were undecided, the Alpha Research poll found. Separately, in an interview with Bulgarian National Radio, Alpha Research’s Boryana Dimitrova, referring to the results of a poll to be announced in coming days, said that there was a high degree of public confidence in the national operational headquarters against Covid-19. “Bulgaria is an interesting case, where on the one hand we have the national operational headquarters, which is an advisory body. In purely managerial terms, this has proved to a useful move, Bulgaria has confidence in the operational HQ and its firm positions, while the approach of clear principles, valid for all, works well. “At the same time, the political power, the government, retains the possibility to agree or not agree with some of the measures proposed by the operational HQ. That is a wonderful opportunity, in which the operational HQ bears the main burden of the ban, while the government retains the opportunity of adaptation in this situation,” Dimitrova said. The desire to loosen the measures did not translate into a decline in confidence in the government, she said. “To be annoyed by some decisions – how a walk in the park is organised, how to get in and out of big cities – does not call into question the big principles of behaviour.” Dimitrova said that at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in Bulgaria, there was a clear cohesion and mobilisation of people, with a high degree of self-discipline, to follow the measures because of the fear of infection. She said that it was normal, given the lack of an increase in the incidence rate in Bulgaria, that this desire for adherence to the measures would gradually weaken. During the State of Emergency and after the hearing of Prime Minister Boiko Borissov in Parliament, the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party had failed to make any gains, Dimitrova said.

"72",208,"https://perceptivetravel.com/blog/2020/04/17/bulgarians/","Spending a Weekend with Bulgarians at a Music Festival","Before I left America, I had no idea what Bulgarians were like, let alone where the country of Bulgaria was! After spending a weekend there, I can say they are some phenomenally fun people! I passed through Bulgaria on my backpacking adventure through the Balkan countries. The Balkan peninsula is the one that extends down into the Mediterranean with Greece at the southern end. North Macedonia is above Greece, and Bulgaria is above North Macedonia. I had an overnight bus from Istanbul which got me into Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria), around 6 in the morning. Unfortunately, my tablet was dead (which was my only mobile device), and thus my adventures began. Due to a miscommunication, I went to the city center to meet my Couchsurfing host while she went to the bus station. I managed to find a guy sitting on a bench who was willing to give her a call. While I waited for her to arrive, I had a fascinating chat with the guy as he knew a bit of English. When she arrived, she was shocked at the man I’d chosen to talk to, claiming he was ex-mafia and she would never have approached him. I guess looks aren’t everything! We got back to her flat and since I barely slept on the bus (due to some real mafia members smuggling bags of white powder across the border), I passed out on the couch within minutes. When I awoke a couple hours later, she asked me if I wanted to go out to a music festival in the countryside, as she didn’t want to go alone. Of course, I said yes! We jumped on a bus to take us half-way out to Ezdimirtsi, a tiny farming village near the Serbian border, and found a pick-up truck to give us a lift the rest of the way. Her roommate ended up coming with us, and the back of the truck was full of other Bulgarians headed to the festival. Interestingly enough, her roommate rarely wore more than a pair of shorts while walking around town (no shirt or shoes), which is completely acceptable in Bulgaria. The organization of the festival was fascinating, to say the least. It was a local affair with several bands performing, and the stage construction was rather decent. I’d say about 300-400 people came to listen. Unfortunately, less than a dozen of those spoke any English, as far as I could tell. English as a second language isn’t big in Bulgaria.  Things got interesting on the first night when they realized no one had brought food for dinner. They started a collection and went off to the market (which wasn’t close), only to return a couple hours later with no food and a couple hundred gallons of beer! Finally around midnight, hunger won out and they pilfered some vegetables from the nearby farms to use in a massive stew (which wasn’t that good, but I don’t think anyone noticed after the beer). Nearly everyone had their own bottle of homemade mastika (moonshine) too, so things were pretty wild. The next day, several of us piled into a convertible to visit one of the nearby waterfalls. And by several of us, I mean we managed to fit 12 people in, on and practically under the car. Things got a little terrifying when we came around a bend at high speed and had another car just in front of us, but we managed to avoid an accident (not sure how, considering how inebriated everyone was). At least the waterfall was worth the hellish drive. I spent quite some time in the water escaping from the blistering summer heat.  After several more adventures at the festival, my host and I went back to Sofia. I got on a walking tour to see the city, learn the history (which is quite extensive), explore the Roman ruins and discover their surprisingly beautiful churches. It definitely wasn’t what I expected to find there, especially after the NATO operations in the Balkans left so many Balkan cities in ruins (like Skopje, Macedonia which lost 95% of its buildings!)  Before leaving, I found a restaurant selling lamb kofte (Turkish meatballs). They were so good, I ordered two more portions to take with me on my bus ride to Belgrade, Serbia. Overall, the weekend was fantastic, and I was really happy with how enjoyable and laid back the locals were, including the old ex-mafia don I met at the waterfalls.  I should probably mention that my host explained to me how the mafia men marked themselves with tattoos. As many of them were incarcerated or killed off, any who remained with extensive tattoos were undoubtedly quite powerful. Of course, that might be more opinion than fact, but still an interesting part of my adventure there. And unlike the portrayal of Albanian mafia in the movie Taken (which don’t actually exist in Albania), Bulgarian mafia men were really friendly!

The Green Deal proposed by the European Commission to the national governments aims to ensure clean future by 2050. We still don’t know what the price would be but one thing is clear that it will be higher than we can imagine. In Bulgaria, the Green Deal provoked strong opposition, as its eventual adoption would mean the closing down of coal-fired power plants in the country, which is expected to have a huge negative impact on the economy. Currently, coal-fired power plants in the Maritsa basin alone provide 40% of Bulgaria’s electricity. During the winter months, this number increases to 60%. These are base capacities, and are practically the ‘backbone’ of the Bulgarian energy, and because of their maneuverability and technical characteristics they are most suitable for maintaining the load and balance of our electricity system. Even the most ardent opponents of coal-fired power generation recognize that thermal power plants are of the utmost importance and there is no alternative, at least so far, for the stability of the energy system. All this has prompted the government to announce that it will fight for the maximum extension of the work of the Bulgarian coal-fired power plants. The energy heart of the countryA few hundred kilometers away from the political debate epicenter, the Green Deal is perceived from a completely different angle in Stara Zagora. For the people of the region, coal-fired power plants are their daily life, they are a symbol of prosperity and potential for future development. Tens of thousands connect their families’ livelihoods and well-being to the TPPs and their sustainable operation. ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP is managed by a foreign investor. It has been modernized and meets the highest EU environmental requirements. Working there is a great career opportunity for hundreds of young engineers from the region. The mark it leaves in the daily life of the people in the town of Galabovo and the surrounding settlements is visible.ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPPIn 2011, the modernized Maritsa East 3 TPP is acquired by the international investor ContourGlobal from the Italian Enel. As a result of the large-scale project for rehabilitation and modernization, the power plant becomes the first TPP in Southeastern Europe to meet the highest environmental requirements and meets 10% of the electricity needs of Bulgaria. Since then, ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP has surpassed its primary role and has become a professional “haven” for generations of Bulgarians.The past comes to lifeLast year Gennadi Zhambov, External Installations Unit operator at ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP lead through the power plant’s front gate his father Raicho to show him the changes that occurred at this place of work in a few decades after his retirement. Gennadi admits that his father was extremely excited about what he saw; the big difference between today’s modern TPP and the one he remembers from the black and white photos. This reunion is a friendly smile of destiny to a family that has connected its life path with electricity for half a century. It all started back in the 70sMaritsa East 3 TPPs is put in operation in 1978 with only one energy unit. The construction of the present-day power plant had begun 10 years earlier. This is also the time of the first connection of the Gennadi Zhambov’s family with the coal-fired power plant. My grandmother and grandfather were part of the construction of the complex, and for three generations now my family has been connected to the power plant, he says. Gennadi’s father - Raicho Zhambov, starts work at the power plant immediately after its inauguration. The year is 1976. My father worked at the substation of the power plant. An interesting fact, he started work at the power plant two years before the first director of the TPP was appointed. In those days the practice was to hire the workers first so that the complex can function and only after that appoint the director. Gennadi’s first memories of the plant date since then: Daddy took me to the substation where he worked many times and showed me the grids. I asked him what the wires were for, and he explained to me. I must have been 1st grade at the time, Gennadi recalls with a smile. In the coming years, his mother, Zhelyazka, starts work at the power plant as does his uncle. She is assigned to the Coal Supply department. There is almost no relative of his who is not connected somehow with the operation of the TPP. The choice of the youngest member of the family seems predetermined - in 1991 Gennadi enters the power plant. And so, the Dzhambov family has been part of the power plant for more than three decades. Gennadi is an operator of external facilities and is responsible for the generator, transformer and electrical parts.We energy workers are like the military. Discipline is key for our line of work. This is not just a company that generates power; this is a capacity of significance for our national security. Working at the power plant, we do it with the clear awareness that we work for the well-being of the state and Bulgarian citizens. Frankly, I don’t see how the electricity system will exist without us and without the Maritsa East complex at all, Gennadi shares his opinion. In recent years, the power plant itself has undergone significant technological transformation. More than BGN 1 billion has been invested in the modernization of the existing facilities and the construction of new FGDs, which purify over 96% of the Sulphur dioxide released during the lignite coal combustion process. The new image of the TPP also imposes very high workplace safety standards. It took us some time to adapt, but now everything is all right. Our profession faces many challenges on a daily basis - seriousness of work requires perfectionism in terms of safety measures. We follow strict security protocols; it is our responsibility to prevent accidents and to date we are doing great. There is a very serious employers safety policy in force. On the other hand, we also have a serious commitment to the new recruits. They are the future of energy and we have a responsibility to train them well. They learn at different speeds, but they are all motivated and with a positive attitude, says Dzhambov. Many of the employees at ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP can share similar family stories to those of Gennadi - they have parents who were part of the power plant or continue to work at the plant. Very often sons work together with their fathers on the same shift, and fathers train their sons. Nearly 500 people work at the power plant, and power generation is a profession of regional importance. When Gennadi took his father to the power plant, Grandpa Raicho was accompanied by his granddaughter, Ralitsa, Gennadi’s 8-year-old daughter. The proud dad and grandfather don’t know what the future holds for her, but hardly anyone would be surprised if she chooses to continue the family tradition. The most important thing at present is the sense of fulfilling a mission - to generate and supply electricity. And this is something that the energy worker families at the power plant have mastered perfectly. We need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

"80",236,"https://bumbleb.home.blog/2020/05/10/bulgarians-as-they-are/","Bulgarians as they are","Everything ever written by the ones who left their countries in the search for a better life is a cliché. The cliché is especially painful when those who fled the East for the West try to reflect on their roots. Through the eyes of an adult, brought up in an ex-soviet state, the world should now be extended beyond the iron curtain once casting a thick shadow over crops, cultures and souls. But for many the fall of the curtain was a painful push, an unforeseeable future, a frightful glimpse into an unknown world. Many of the people in these countries are hard workers. They are essentially the moving force of a communist state. Working themselves to the bone, all their lives. And then someone ten years younger shows up, suited up, diploma achieved somewhere in the West, and becomes their boss. For some that grew up under the curtain the thought of going to the mythical “West” is still a wild embryo of an idea. To them, the younger generations, readily crossing physical and ideological borders, are choosing the easy exit out. Leaving their peoples, their families and quickly after, sporting the pink goggles of separation. Turning teary eyes back to the horizon and thinking “So close, yet so far.” To this, anybody who was left behind will irritably say “If you like it that much, you know the way back.” And maybe they would be right. But I am here to talk specifically about those pink separation goggles. Goggles which not only Bulgarians wear after having crossed the border. But everyone dared to look for their happiness elsewhere, outside their countries. Those pink goggles change who you are after you leave something that has been with you for too long. In this case, your home country. They make you start eating foods you vowed not to taste just because they smell like your grandmother’s house. Make you speak with your own accent as firmly and uncompromisingly as you never have been brave enough to. They tell you to no longer pretend to be someone else. Those glasses now bend your understanding of self, they beg you to pay tribute to your little country, curled up somewhere beyond the horizon. My pink glasses have recently started to remind me of my favorite childhood memories. I grew up in Lyulin, one of the outermost districts of Sofia, where neighborhood and brotherhood blend seamlessly in the panel cells. The most prominent memories of my neighborhood are the summer afternoons. It’s about five o’clock. I and all the other children from the block are outside at the playground. Our grandmothers sit on the bench or at the nearby café. The smell is of roasted peppers. It’s warm. You can hear a low tumult, hugged in the embrace of the hot summer afternoon, as if we are all in a bubble. The sun is low over the horizon and everyone is calmer after the lunch heat has passed. The children’s parents are just about to come from work, so we try to squeeze the last few hours of play before dinner. Neighbors sit with plastic cups of coffee and beer on the low broken benches, in slippers, playing table. Sunflower seeds cover the ground around their feet. This is my childhood. And it was lived and hidden among the panel giants. Remains of a forgotten past, small pigeonholes full of stories. It is as if this moment of the summer afternoon completely encompasses the personality of the Bulgarian person. Slightly rugged, warm, noisy…in slippers. Full of children. Full of grandmothers. A little coarse. Looking for trouble. Real. So I came back this summer and took these pictures of him. I went around two of Lyulin’s neighborhoods and photographed exactly those people who are my childhood. And although fifteen years later, although with different faces, they were all the same to me. As before. I was pleasantly surprised that most of the people I asked for a photo were willing to participate. They understood the concept. Somehow they seemed to know that they were part of something real and different. This is probably my favorite photograph. The popsicle, the scraped knee, the facial expression, sitting on the tennis table. The background – a panel block and trees, because somehow we managed to keep Sofia green. I think all Bulgarians remember themselves as her. A collective image of all our childhoods – past and present. No matter how far West we go, no matter how integrated we try to become, somewhere deep inside each of us is her. An untamed Balkan child with a bruised knee. And these were three neighbors. I caught them talking (or rather shouting) to each other – the grandmother from the bench in front of the entrance, and the lady from the window on the first floor. This gentleman was waiting for his grandson. “They bring him to me every few days, this banana here is for him and I poured him water from the sink for when he starts playing with the others.” Finally, a toast. I positioned this group of neighbors at the beginning, but I also want to end with a photo of them. In fact, when I was younger, I took private math lessons in the block in front of which they sat for a cup of beer. I myself remembered that there was some sort of an outside dining space there. Almost like a gazebo, a table with benches around it and a roof above, in between the trees. The group hurried to tell me how the municipality had ruined it for no reason just because of the afternoon gatherings. “But we’ll make another one, no problem,” one of them told me as he showed me pictures of the former wooden gazebo. “It seems the lack of a gazebo or a shed doesn’t stop you,” I told him smiling. “Well, of course!” He laughed and made a toast. The small struggle of this group for their gazebo with the municipality was such a typical Bulgarian problem that it could not but become another metaphor for the Bulgarian person. He does something good – they ruin it. And there is always a they. This mysterious entity is present in the personal battle of every ex-communist state. Some would argue it is because of years of communal distrust, others would say it is almost PTSD. But there is always a they, they that ruin everything good, they that take the money, they that make it all wrong. Although when you ask who they are, you would get mixed answers – politicians, rich people, communists, capitalists. Always someone to blame. The Bulgarian person then gets angry, spits, blames whoever is available, but at the end of the day he still finds a way to do his thing. I know that with this project I did not resolve much, but I was not trying to. I simply wanted to take a piece of Bulgaria, one that is hidden deep underneath travel videos of mountains and beaches, but one that is extremely, painfully real. And capture its ambience. Hand it to anybody who would listen. This is just a small district in a small town in a small country. Its people have been through slavery of many kinds. The collective societal trauma has soaked through the fabric of this community and its presence is felt even on this quiet summertime afternoon. And maybe some of it translates into much they do – into who they have become today. The problematic nature of their characters is obvious – they are hurt, they are poor, they are just starting their transition into a new world. But understanding eastern politics through a western point of view will never be possible. This is why we first need to understand the people. I grew up with these people. And they are all somewhere in me – the children with the scraped knees, the grandmothers, the toasts, the shouting. It may be a cliché, but no matter how heavy the English rain gets, it cannot wash away some things.

The topic? The reclamation of his Bulgarian identity and renouncement of a Macedonian one. The YouTuber Bobby’s Perspectives has just under 100,000 subscribers and a total of 4.65 million views. At the beginning of the video he said this is “for my Balkan brothers and sisters. For my Bulgarian brothers and sisters. For my Greek brothers and sisters. For my Serbian brothers and sisters. But more importantly… most importantly actually, this video is for my ‘North Macedonian’ brothers and sisters,” using hand signals to invert comas to North Macedonia. The YouTuber, speaking in a very thick typical German accent, explained that his followers know him to identify as a Macedonian-Slav but that he was not overly patriotic because he was raised in Germany. He emphasised that he is a truth seeker, and this is reflected in his videos about diet and religion. However, in his quest for truth seeking, it took him down a road that surely he would have never expected… His very own identity. “I did my research, objectively. I investigated the Greek side. I investigated the Bulgarian side. I investigated the rest of the world. I investigated the Osman [Ottoman] archives, the Turkish archives. I investigated the ‘Macedonian’ claims’,” the YouTuber said, who went on to say that Slavs first arrived in the Balkans 900 years after Alexander the Great’s death. The next part of the video would have taken many people by surprise. See Also: What did ancient languages sound like? (video) 200 years since the 1821 Greek Revolution – Prince Charles in Athens (photos) “I am talking from the heart, I’m talking to my fellow ‘North Macedonians’, and even I cannot accept that name any longer,” as the camera zooms into his fingers doing inverted comas. The reason why he no longer accepts the name Macedonian? “Because Macedonia was Greece, and it is well established and historical truth – as simple as that. We are not the descendants of Alexander, we are Slavs,” he emphasized.  The YouTuber then explains that many historical figures, such as Tsar Samuil the Bulgarian and Gotse Delchev, are claimed as Macedonian, but are in actual fact Bulgarian – just in case Tsar Samuil “the Bulgarian” was not obvious enough. In fact, Byzantine Emperor Basil II had the nickname “the Bulgar Slayer” as Tsar Samuil the Bulgarian was his greatest adversary. See Also: Murder of Solomos Solomou: This is how his assassination was ordered Great city routes to explore on foot in Athens He then references Ottoman records that noted in the geographic region of Macedonia there were many ethnic groups, including Greeks, Bulgarians and Jews, but never a separate Macedonian ethnicity listed. The YouTuber explained that Josip Broz Tito, the communist dictator of Yugoslavia, was against Bulgarian identity in the region of Macedonia and started the propaganda, killing those who continued to identify as Bulgarian. “My great-grandfather was haunted by the Serbs for saying he was Bulgarian,” he said.

Cars stop, pedestrians bow their heads and students rise at their desks. Everyone observes a moment of dignified silence. The sirens have long since stopped warning of imminent danger – there are no enemy airplanes over Sofia, no foreign armies marching across the Thracian plains. The sirens sound to remind us of those Bulgarians who died for Bulgaria’s freedom and present-day peace. On June 2 Bulgaria remembers the armies of khan Tervel, who defended Europe against the Arabs, the defenders of Medieval Tarnovo, the heroes of the April uprising, the martyrs of Shipka, the young Bulgarian flying aces who defended Sofia from English and American bombers, as well as countless other known and unknown Bulgarians who laid their lives in the name of our sovereignty. On June 2, 1876, Hristo Botev, one of the most celebrated Bulgarians in history, was killed in battle in the crags of Stara Planina near Vratza. A poet, a journalist and a revolutionary, Botev was also extremely intelligent and fervent in his ideals. Deeply convinced of the need for the armed liberation of Bulgaria and a sympathizer of the Paris Commune, Botev took an active role in the planning activities of the revolutionary committees outside Bulgaria’s borders. In his poem “Parting”, he wrote: Well, I know, mother, you love me; Maybe in my youth I shall perish Tomorrow when I cross over Beyond the calm, shining, Danube, But what would you have me to do now? Since you have borne me, mother, With a strong heart of a hero? That heart, Dear mother, can’t suffer Seeing the Turks rage like mad dogs Over the hearth of my father’s, … The company’s starting already. Our road is dreadful but glorious. Perhaps I shall die in my youth But enough for me is this guerdon That people may say of me one day ” He died, poor fellow, for Justice, For the cause of Justice and Freedom.” Botev wrote this poem in 1868 while he, only 20 years old, was preparing to cross the Danube under the command of Zhelyu Voyvoda. Unfortunately, the company fell apart and Botev wasn’t given the opportunity to defend his ideals. And the idealist’s worst enemy is routine. Botev spent the following eight years in Romania in abject poverty – the fiery revolutionary, writing with gleaming eyes about the heroic sacrifice of the freedom fighter, existed in a gruelling, atrophying routine, working dawn to dusk to support ten compatriots, as well as his beloved Veneta, his infant son and his mother. When the April Uprising began and it turned out that there was no one to lead the company being prepared in Romania, Botev saw the opportunity to finally help his country, to fight for his ideals and to die not of starvation in Wallachia, but armed and face-to-face with the conqueror. He commandeered the steamship Radetzky and crossed the Danube at the head of two hundred men, prepared to aid the uprising in the Vratza region and to raise all of Northern Bulgaria to arms with him. Imagine his excitement at stepping on Bulgarian soil near Kozloduy, how eagerly he looked around to spot the first throngs of the risen nation, ready to cast aside its centuries-old chains! But the Vratza region was not up in arms. Not reinforcements, but pursuers awaited him. Like every regiment in the April Uprising, Botev’s is doomed – the enemy was well prepared and outnumbers them heavily. Not only that, but since the April Uprising began prematurely, by the time of Botev’s landing most rebels had been destroyed and the people had realized that the uprising is already quelled and there would be no one to defend them if they rise. On June 1 Botev received the news that there were no reinforcements and that he and his comrades were alone against thousands of Ottoman soldiers and an artillery squad. It’s unreasonable to believe that Botev was eager to die, that he joyfully accepted his unavoidable demise. Like all humans, he dreamt of victory and of growing old in peace in his liberated homeland. A heroic death was preferable to any other, but he sensed with anguish that his death and that of his comrades, while heroic, would ultimately be in vain. In spite of this his company fought to the last man, to the last drop of blood. The following year its shining example gave courage to the Bulgarian volunteer corps, then fed the imagination and pride of the newly liberated nation and left a shining trail in Bulgaria’s history. While the sirens wail, Bulgarians bow their heads to the self-sacrifice of all who have died for Bulgaria’s liberty and independence. People who answered the call to arms and who gave their lives for Bulgaria. People like Hristo Botyov Petkov, who died for Bulgaria at the age of 28, on June 2, 1876. If I come Dear Little Mother, Safe and sound back to the village In my hands bearing the standard, Under it all the brave heroes Golden lions on their foreheads With rifles slung on their shoulders, Swords like snakes at their belts, Then, Oh Heroic Mother, Oh, my dear pretty sweetheart Gather ivy and cranesbill, Wind them to wreaths and to bunches To deck our heads and our rifles. Then with a wreath and flowers Come to me, Mother, embrace me, Kiss my forehead made lovely By two words evermore sacred: F r e e d o m or D e a t h heroic. blazingbulgaria.wordpress.com We need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

""We visited two important joint projects, the completion of the highway from the border of the two countries and Sofia, and then we would have the Belgrade-Sofia highway, taking 3 hours. This is something that neither Serbs nor Bulgarians could even have dreamed of for many decades,"" Vucic said as he addressed journalists after touring the route of the future gas pipeline Balkan Stream in Kursumski Vodopadi together with Bulgarian PM Boyko Borisov. See what Balkan Stream looks like: He added that the construction of the Balkan Stream is essential for the future of Serbia and Bulgaria. Vucic said that he visited the works on the construction of the highway near Slivnica and Dragoman and personally saw how successfully the works are progressing and congratulated the Bulgarians. He said that he and Borisov then went to the northern part of central Bulgaria, where they toured works on the construction of Balkan Stream, which is essential for the future of Bulgaria and Serbia. ""I'm not sure that people in both countries understand the importance of that investment now. The construction of this gas pipeline will mean growth of the economy and industrial production for both countries, as well as providing gas supplies for households in the long term, which is one of the most important energy sources,"" stated Vucic. He stressed that the gas pipeline has, as he said, strategic and in-depth significance for progress of investments in both countries. ""I saw how fast works are being done and how well Bulgarians do it and I hope that in a short period of time we will complete connecting the Bulgarian gas pipeline with the Serbian gas pipeline in the territory of Zajecar,"" said Vucic and added that Serbia will soon build a gas interconnector from Nis to Bulgaria with the financial support from the EU. ""I am grateful to Boyko Borisov, because I saw more today than during all previous trips,"" Vucic stated. Vucic thanked Borisov for supporting Serbia on the European path, which, as he said, is not always easy, and added that Boyko is the holder of the highest order given by the Republic of Serbia and has an obligation to help Serbia. He thanked the prime minister of Bulgaria, who, as he said, has invested a lot of effort, energy and enthusiasm in creating best possible relations between Serbia and Bulgaria, and Serbs and Bulgarians. He stressed that Serbia perceives Bulgaria as a truly friendly country, and the Bulgarian people as brotherly The president emphasized that no one in Serbia would say a single ugly word about Bulgarians and Bulgaria, and that Serbs perceive Bulgarians as a brotherly people and Bulgaria as a friendly state. Vucic added that you will not be able to find someone in Serbia who will say something bad about Bulgaria if you looked for them with a magnifying glass. ""All this that Borisov has organized speaks sufficiently to that closeness,"" Vucic added.  Photo: Instagram/buducnostsrbijeav Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov pointed out today that works on the Balkan Stream gas pipeline through his country did not stop during the coronavirus crisis. The project, the Bulgarian prime minister points out, will benefit both countries while future generations will be able to benefit financially. He said the project is being implemented with the help of the European Commission, respecting all the requirements of the Third Liberalization Package, ""with applause from Belgrade, Moscow and the United States."" ""I showed the Serbian president the new expansion we are working on. We are working on two large compressor stations that will operate under 64-bar pressure. Until now, the throughput was 22 bar, and it will go up to 70 bar, so that our Serbian friends could collect transit taxes from higher throughput,"" Borisov explained in a joint address to the media with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic after visiting the works on the gas pipeline. He pointed out that work is also being done on an interconnector with Greece, and that the entire Balkan Stream project will guarantee diversification, because Russian, American, Qatari, Turkish and gas from other parts of the world will be able to pass through the gas pipeline. Borisov pointed out that this is a fully Bulgarian investment. He recalled South Stream was stopped by Brussels due to corrupt practices in tenders, but that everything is transparent regarding Balkan Stream. In that regard, he pointed out that Greek companies, as well as a company from Saudi Arabia, are involved in the works worth 250 million euros, invested by Bulgaria, and that there are Italians, Greeks and Arabs among about 1,200 workers. He pointed out that coronavirus led to a project delay of two to three months, and announced that compressors would arrive in October for the compressor stations that they visited today. He stressed that the coronavirus took many human lives, caused great damage to the economy around the whole world, but that now is the time for Serbian and Bulgarian people to socialize and visit again. ""We didn't choose June 1, Children's Day, for this visit for nothing. We are big kids, we love to play. So we flew in a helicopter and then rode in an SUV. It was extremely pleasant. Symbolically, this abolishes the quarantine. And I hope that with all the symbolism, we will manage to forget the Covid 19 crisis,"" said Borisov. He added that it is time to return to normal life and work, stressing that during the current crisis, works on the route of the Balkan Stream did not stop.

Amid the coronavirus crisis, in most European countries, trust in the United States is broken – with the exception of Bulgaria, where 56 per cent say that their view of the US has not changed. This is among findings in a new polling-backed report, published on June 29 by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The poll has found that, while many Europeans believe the European Union (EU) failed to provide sufficient leadership and support during the coronavirus crisis, a majority of citizens see European-level cooperation as the single-best vehicle for tackling major foreign policy issues, such as Covid-19 – particularly against a backdrop of US isolationism. It argues that this new pro-Europe sentiment, revealed from ECFR’s polling data, will be conditional and require delicate handling by Europe’s leaders, and Germany, as it assumes the presidency of the EU. The report, which is based on Datapraxis and YouGov polling from nine EU member states, provides a comprehensive analysis of the politics of the novel coronavirus, and also reveals a hollowing out of support for the transatlantic partnership – with just 2 per cent of polled Europeans expressing the view that the United States is a “helpful” ally in the fight with Covid-19. Authored by policy experts, Susi Dennison and Pawel Zerka, ‘Together in trauma: Europeans and the world after covid-19’ argues that Europe is in a state of “trauma” and that its citizens feel “alone and vulnerable” in their battle with the virus. It notes widespread dissatisfaction with national governments, and the failings of the EU, in response. It attributes Europe’s new, “trauma-like” condition to three causes: the first, from individual member-led responses and inadequate performance of national governments; the second, from the EU’s persistent failure to take ownership of international issues; and third, concerns about the new-world order in light of the EU’s fractured relationship with the US, and the threat China will pose to the international rules-based system. Key findings in ECFR’s new polling-backed report, include: ● Trust in the US is broken. In virtually every country, people were most likely to report that their perception of the US had become increasingly negative. In Denmark (71 per cent), Portugal (70 per cent), France (68 per cent), Germany (65 per cent) and Spain (64 per cent), around two-thirds said that their view of the US has worsened during the crisis. This was particularly marked in France and Germany, where 46 per cent and 42 per cent respectively said their view of the US had worsened ‘a lot’ as a result of the corona crisis. Only in Poland and Bulgaria was the dominant answer ‘no change’ (at 49 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively). The proportion of respondents who felt that the US had been a key ally through the crisis was vanishingly small, with the largest proportion in Italy, at just 6 per cent. ● The crisis has increased Europeans’ negativity towards China. Over 60 per cent in France (62 per cent) and Denmark (62 per cent) report a deteriorating perception of China. In every country higher proportions reported increasing negativity, rather than positivity, towards China, apart from in Bulgaria where an equal number (22 per cent) report an improved and worsened perception of China. Interestingly, in Italy, China was seen as the country’s most useful ally in the crisis by a quarter of those polled (25 per cent) – and particularly among supporters of Five Star (M5S) – probably because of its offer of ventilators and vital PPE, in the early stages of the pandemic. ● In every country a dominating share of voters reported no change in their perception of Russia, probably because the country has not played a high-profile role in the crisis. Among those whose perception has shifted, it is usually in a negative direction, especially in Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Poland. Two notable exceptions are Bulgaria (27 per cent) and Italy (23 per cent), where around a quarter of the population reported an improved perception of Russia, outnumbering those who say they view the Eastern country more negatively. Though, generally, improved perception of Russia is limited to voters of right-wing populists, it is a view more widely held in Italy by members of the M5S, as well as supporters of Lega and Brothers of Italy. ● There is strengthening support for action on climate change, despite the current health pandemic. Over 40 per cent in all member states polled, except in Denmark (22 per cent), Sweden (31 per cent) and France (37 per cent), said their support for the implementation of climate commitments has increased during the covid crisis. Spanish (60 per cent) and Portuguese (58 per cent) voters are most likely to say their support for the implementation of such commitments has increased. ● Many Europeans report a rising support for stricter border controls since the crisis began. From 48 per cent of the population in Denmark to 73 per cent in Portugal. More specifically, there were strong majorities in Bulgaria (61 per cent) and Portugal (60 per cent), and considerable minority views in Germany (46 per cent), Denmark (48 per cent) and France (46 per cent), for stricter controls at the EU’s external borders. ● Many of those advocating the closing of borders and returning power to nation states also recognise the value of developing more global responses from the EU. 42 per cent (in Sweden and Italy) to 76 per cent (in Bulgaria) of those calling for a more global response from the EU are at the same time supporting stronger controls of external borders. ● Most Europeans polled do not think the EU has “lived up to its responsibilities” in the pandemic. 63 per cent of Italians, 61 per cent of French and 52 per cent of Spaniards disagreed with the statement that the EU had done so. ‘Irrelevance’ was the way that a large plurality (and in some cases a majority) in every member state described the EU’s response. In France (58 per cent), Spain (45 per cent), Germany (44 per cent) and Bulgaria (50 per cent), those agreeing that the EU has been irrelevant during the coronavirus crisis, and that national or global responses are more important, outnumbered by a factor of three those who disagreed (18 per cent, 17 per cent, 15 per cent, and 18 per cent respectively). ● However, there is strong support for more cooperation in the EU. When asked whether the European response to the coronavirus crisis showed that there was a need for more European level cooperation or whether it showed that EU integration had gone too far, majorities in all countries opted for more cooperation. (91 per cent in Portugal, 80 per cent in Spain, 77 per cent in Italy, and 68 per cent in Poland). Even in less Europhile member states including France (52 per cent), Sweden (51 per cent) and Denmark (53 per cent), more than half of the respondents chose the cooperation option; and just around 20 per cent said the opposite. ● Europeans are split on whether EU institutions would help with the economic recovery. When asked where help would come from on the recovery, the largest proportion in Portugal (59 per cent), Poland (46 per cent), Spain (41 per cent), Bulgaria (37 per cent), and France (28 per cent) chose the EU. However, this is far less true in northern countries (Germany, Sweden, Denmark) for whom the crisis found a widespread perception that they had to handle such crises alone. For example, just under half of those polled in Germany (48 per cent) expressed the view that their ‘country can only rely on itself’ in its financial recovery from the crisis. Through segmentation of the polling, the paper’s authors, Dennison and Zerka, identify four constituencies that have emerged in Europe following the outbreak of the coronavirus, and examine areas of commonality across these groups and how they might be brought together on key issues of foreign policy. The first group – the ‘Engaged internationalists’ – are prominent in each of the polled member states. They are natural allies of the EU’s international ambitions, and, in many cases, are supporters of Europe’s centrist parties, including Partito Democratico (PD), in Italy, La Republique en Marche (LREM), in France, and the Civic Coalition (KO), in Poland. For example, in Italy (where ‘Engaged internationalists’ represent almost a third of the population), support for PD is twice as high within this group as in the country’s overall population. The second group – the ‘EU-critical internationalists’ – share in the vision of stronger Europe and, like the ‘Engaged internationalists’, are happy to support a greater financial solidarity among the EU member states, the implementation of climate commitments, and efforts to consolidate the production of medical and non-medical within the European bloc. However, they disagree with the basic conclusion that these should necessarily entail more EU integration or enlargement. In no country are they a dominating group of voters – but, everywhere, they correspond to at least a fifth of the electorate. Voters of FDP in Germany are likely to fall within this group, as well as those of Unidas Podemos in Spain, and the Brothers of Italy, in Italy. They also comprise many voters of the parties that are traditionally associated with the mainstream. The third group of voters – the “Switched-off Europeans” – is large, but less vocal on issues and the role of Europe in the post-covid world. This constituency is largely opposed to the idea of sharing the financial burden of the coronavirus among the EU’s member states, and are also more likely to want stricter border controls. However, they share some commonality with the previous groups, in their support for surveillance for health reasons and executing their climate commitments. They represent the largest group of voters in Bulgaria (31 per cent), and also have a strong presence in Portugal (23 per cent) and Italy (22 per cent). They are also, in many cases, the most politically diverse group: in France, for example, this group represents a quarter of the population and includes voters of La Republique en Marche, Rassemblement National, Les Republicains, and the Greens; while, in Poland, there is a similar story, with voters of PiS and Civic Coalition. And, last, the final group – the ‘Nation first’– is one dominated by supporters of populist or nationalist parties, including Lega, in Italy, PiS, in Poland, Vox, in Spain, SD, in Sweden, and Rassemeblement National, in France. People of this group are less likely to support global engagement, but share many of anxieties of the other groups. For example, in Germany, France and Denmark, a third of them are interested in bringing some production back – even if they may see it as a matter of national rather than European sovereignty – and everywhere, except for Denmark, Sweden and Germany, a third or more would support proposals for greater financial solidarity in Europe. Dennison and Zerka note that, while there are major divergences in opinion across the four groups, there are opportunities to bring them together on key issues. For example, even on politically challenging topics, such as border control, there is scope to build a broad coalition for the development of a procedural mechanism, which would allow the EU to respond, effectively, to major health and humanitarian crisis. Such a move would greatly reduce the probability of the national-led responses, which divide the bloc, and which ran through Europe in response to both covid-19 and the 2015 migrant crisis. Concluding, the authors reaffirm the point that “many Europeans feel that they have been left alone in this crisis”, and that to elicit their support for a strong European voice on the global stage, “policymakers will need to build coalitions by identifying where there is consensus”. To achieve a positive end, and prevent a new wave of Euroscepticism, it calls on EU leaders to set aside their ambitions of “more Europe”, and focus, instead, on identifying and constructing common denominators for the betterment of its members.

Thousands of people filled a central area in Sofia near the presidency and the Council of Ministers demanding the resignation of the conservative government. Protests also took place in Burgas, Plovdiv, Varna, Blagoevgrad, and Gabrovo, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter. In Sofia, Burgas, and Varna, the protests turned into marches, with people shouting ""Resign!,"" ""Mafia!,"" and demanding the ouster of Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev. The protests were sparked by a raid on July 9 by the Prosecutor-General's Office on the presidential headquarters. President Rumen Radev's legal affairs and anti-corruption secretary and his security and defense adviser were detained for questioning and their offices searched as part of two separate probes into influence-peddling and disclosure of state secrets. Demonstrations The searches sparked public anger and brought thousands of demonstrators onto the streets of Sofia to condemn the raids as an attack by the government and the prosecutor-general against Radev. Radev responded two days later by calling on the government and the prosecutor-general to step down. The searches came after Radev said the National Protection Service (NSO) -- which is responsible for guarding the president, prime minister, and other high officials -- should stop protecting Ahmed Dogan, the honorary chairman of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS). Protesters were also angered when people were barred from a state beach located near Dogan’s summer residence. Access to the beach was restored on July 11 under pressure from the center-right Democratic Bulgaria opposition. Radev is an outspoken critic of the cabinet of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, accusing it of ""links with oligarchs."" Borisov has refused to resign but opponents launched an online petition aiming to gather as many as 1 million signatures to demand his ouster. The Socialist opposition in parliament also said on July 12 that they would propose a no-confidence motion against the cabinet for ""corruption"" on July 15 and appealed to protesters to back them. The protesters say their nationwide demonstration will take place the next day.

As of this week, the Czech Republic wants coronavirus tests for Bulgarian seasonal workers. Denmark allows Bulgarians on its territory only if they have an address registration there, an employment contract or a document certifying a business trip.As of today, people who have visited Bulgaria and Romania in the last 14 days are subject to mandatory quarantine in Italy. In Finland, entry is only for a ""valid reason"".Mandatory home quarantine in Austria, despite a negative PCR test. This is already required for those entering Germany. For the next 14 days, access to southern Romania was denied without good reason. And Greece has tightened measures even more along its land borders. Belgium, Lithuania and Netherlands with Quarantine for Bulgarians From Tuesday, those traveling by plane from Bulgaria to Greece will have to present to the Greek border authorities a negative result from a PCR test for coronavirus, performed up to 72 hours before their entry into our southern neighbor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced. They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test will be allowed in the country. It must be issued in English and contain the three names and numbers of the passenger's passport or identity card. The authorities in our southern neighbor will not accept certificates that do not meet these requirements ""Travelers should be tested in the laboratory by RT-PCR by taking secretions from the mouth or nose. Tests for coronavirus will be recognized if they are performed in national reference laboratories, national health laboratories or private laboratories that are accredited by the relevant national accreditation bodies (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19). The measure does not apply to Greek citizens, citizens residing in Greece and travelers for significant professional reasons. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that on Tuesday, July 28, and Wednesday, July 29, passengers who did not have time to be tested before their trip will be tested by the competent Greek authorities upon arrival in Greece. The requirement for citizens traveling by plane to Greece to fill in at least 24 hours in advance an electronic Passenger Location Form (PLF) generating a QR code, which they present to the Greek authorities upon entering the country, remains in force. More information is published on travel.gov.gr At the moment there is no change in the requirements for crossing the land borders between Bulgaria and Greece. ""Travelers to Greece across the land border, regardless of their citizenship, must also fill in an electronic passenger localization form (PLF) generating a QR code at least 24 hours before arrival,"" the Foreign Ministry explained. The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich. There are no problems with the transition. There are no queues of trucks. All those waiting go to sea in Greece. Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower. Three of the points on the Bulgarian-Greek border are working. Only ""Ilinden - Exohi"" and this part of Ivaylovgrad are closed.

The costs versus benefits of this phenomenon are under-studied. By examining seasonal farm migration from Romania to Germany, we argue that the Covid-19 pandemic is, for farmworkers, a Janus-faced event. On the one hand, it has worsened the precarity of migrant farmworkers. Changes in the German state’s pay legislation that excluded workers from social benefits, and the reluctance of the German state to enforce labour legislation to the full in the early stages of the pandemic sharpened what we have termed the structural disempowerment of migrant farmworkers. Romanian seasonal workers have had little choice but to implicitly subsidise the costs of German farm products. At the same time, the health crisis has made their work visible and led to processes that challenge the perception of migrant workers as passive agents. In this regard we refer specifically to (i) the supportive media coverage in Romania, Germany, and beyond and (ii) the assertion of union-affiliated farm and abattoir labour activism in Germany. These planted seeds of contestation, and collective action against abuses sprang up in several farms. Combined with a flare-up of Covid-19 in German abattoirs in the summer of 2020, these campaigns for visibility and improved working conditions led the German government to alter legislation so as to better protect seasonal labour in the fresh vegetable and meat sectors. Going forward, the tension between these two opposing sociopolitical drivers may shape the governance of seasonal labour in Europe.

Labour migration in the time of Covid-19: inequalities and perspectives for change (edited by Giulia Ciliberto and Fulvia Staiano) 2021 • Giulia Ciliberto The pandemic caused by the spread of Covid-19 has produced a dramatic impact on economies and societies around the world. Migrant workers and labour migration fluxes have been far from exempt from the negative consequences of the so-called “new coronavirus”. The contributions collected in this volume eloquently illustrate this phenomenon, by highlighting the protection gaps unveiled by COVID-19 and by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of States’ responses to the difficulties experienced by migrant workers worldwide during the pandemic. This volume is among the initiatives related to the EULab Summer School on Labour Migration in the European Union, a project funded with the support of the Eramus+ Programme of the European Union. Work Organisation, Labour & Globalisation 2012 • Bjarke Refslund Virginia Doellgast, Nathan Lillie In this introduction, the editors develop an original framework to explain why unions are more or less successful in containing the spread of precarious work. They argue that employment precarity is both an outcome of and a central contributing factor to a mutually reinforcing feedback relationship between labour market, welfare state, and collective bargaining institutions; worker identity and identification; and employer and union strategies. Where employers are better able to exploit institutional exit options and divisions in the workforce, they are likely to seek cost containment and control via precarious employment relationships. Unions’ success in responding to these challenges depends on mobilizing power resources derived from inclusive institutions and inclusive forms of worker solidarity. This framework builds on academic discussions of institutional change, dualism, and precarious work from three broad research traditions: comparative political economy, critical sociology, and comparative employment relations. The chapter reviews this literature, outlines the framework, and then discusses the chapter findings in the book with reference to the framework. Labour migration in the time of Covid-19: inequalities and perspectives for change (edited by Giulia Ciliberto and Fulvia Staiano) 2021 • Annalisa Geraci The rapid spread of Covid-19 in the world led countries to close their borders, with serious consequences in several areas. Inevitably, the limitation of movements has strongly affected the migrant population. Many countries in the Global North, in a short time the important contribution of migrant workers has been recognized in the agri-food sector. These, normally considered less attractive than high skilled migrant workers, have progressively proved to be essential to overcome the labour shortage in the above mentioned sector. In order to ensure an adequate supply in the agri-food chain, several countries have excluded seasonal migrant workers from the movement restrictions. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the measures implemented by the European Union and its Member States to promote the mobility and employment of migrant farm workers, focusing on the protection of their rights under international and EU law. Hence, has the opening up of EU countries to migrant farm workers been matched by greater protection of their rights? What measures have been taken to ensure the health and safety at work of migrant farm workers? Has the need for their workforce contributed to improving their working conditions or have the problems already present been exacerbated? Is it time to learn from the present to encourage regular and safe channels of entry, or will a return to normality bring back the distortions of the past? 2016 • Claudia Weinkopf, Ines Wagner Nathan Lillie, Kairit Kall, Francesco E . Iannuzzi The PROMO project¹ is based around a series of policy workshops and conferences from 2017 and 2018. The project aims to make recommendations to improve: • national labour protection systems for posted workers; • institutions, practices and channels for promoting industrial democracy for posted workers; • the collection of data relevant to making informed posted worker policy decisions. Our method is to take existing research knowledge and improve on it through policy workshop discussions with experts and stakeholders. The first PROMO report (Kall and Lillie 2017), based on an extensive literature review, established that posted workers more often than not are not represented collectively and trade unions in the host countries either lack (effective) strategies focused on posted workers or consider this target group outside their jurisdiction or just too difficult to engage with. There is, however, considerable diversity between unions in different countries and sectors and some unions have taken steps to protect and represent the interests of posted workers as well. Posted workers often lack voice in their working lives and their rights are frequently violated (either accidentally or deliberately) by transnational service providers, making these workers’ need for collective representation especially urgent. Based on a literature review and focus group and individual interviews with social partners and other relevant actors in five different national/industrial relations contexts (Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, and Norway), this report aims both to identify weaknesses in the regulatory framework (whether national or European), that might be addressed through legislation or other policy action, and to make recommendations aimed at trade unions, based on best practices. The latter are not intended to be universally applicable: rather they illuminate strategies that some unions have had success with when addressing posted worker representation problems. Obviously, trade unionists must consider for themselves whether these can also be applied (or adapted) in their home context. Are Agri-food Workers only Exploited in Southern Europe? Case studies on migrant labour in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden 2020 • Karin A. Siegmann This report takes a closer look at causes of and possible responses to unfair labour practices that affect migrant workers from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in the Netherlands’ highly productive agricultural sector. EU enlargement with the associated internal mobility against the backdrop of persistent economic disparities between CEE and Western European countries have enabled Dutch employers to tap a vast reservoir of labour migrants. Agricultural employers’ demand for a low-waged migrant workforce, in turn, responds to price pressure from an increasingly concentrated retail sector. Migrants’ precarity has been enabled by the highly flexibilised Dutch labour market. This includes the legalisation of indirect employment contracts that provide workers with staggered economic and social entitlements, resulting in low wages and high income and employment insecurity. Migrant workers’ bargaining power is further weakened though their high degree of dependency on employers through interlinked employment and accommodation contracts and their lack of a collective voice in the labour market. Potential allies, such as groups lobbying for alternative food systems, are commonly silent on labour conditions in agriculture. Media voices that negatively depict CEE workers as welfare abusers fill this void. To counter unfair labour practices in Dutch agriculture, it is crucial to strengthen migrant farmworkers’ ‘associational power’ through new forms of awareness-raising and organising. This has to be complemented through effective implementation of existing labour rights guarantees, requiring the allocation of more resources to and the shift towards a worker-centred labour inspection. A streamlined civil procedure to recover unpaid wages, overtime and holiday pay and the reintroduction of recruitment agency licensing would represent further important steps towards fair labour conditions of migrant farmworkers. Last but not least, institutional innovation to guarantee fair prices for producers and living wages for farmworkers would represent key building blocks for humanising the agro-food chain.

The online exhibition “Beyond differences” is being conducted under the UN Refugee Agency initiative and is presenting the joint art projects of visual artists, painters and musicians in Bulgaria, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. The idea is to bring closer different representatives of different cultures and, with the aid of multicultural art, to open our eyes for the beauty and diversity of our world.  “My project partner is called Ali Haj Ali - an architecture student. I believe that he liked my work since it is related to space in the broader sense of the term,” shares Radina Stoimenova, visual artist. The Bulgarian girlwho is living and working in France and the Afghanstudent who resides in Bulgaria are representing themselves with the joint work called “Goodbye Windows” - a story of childhood memories and sorrow coming from the inability to return back there. “I offered Ali to begin what would be something resembling a conversation about the places which we hold dear,” says Radina. “We quickly concluded that these places are our homes. He described his parents’ house to me, where he grew up with his siblings. And I told him about the dwelling of my grandparents. Each of us was painting the dearest place solely with words - and in that way, Ali created a professional architectural layout of what I associate my childhood with, and I recreated his house’s plan in my artistic manner.”   Radina does not recreate the pieces of furniture, she just tells the story about them, while taking a walk in the imaginary home of Ali. Whereas he is able to inspire some warmth in her miniature model home through the use of some objects she holds dear to her heart. Silsila Mahbub – just like Ali, comes from Afghanistan and loves singing authentic songs from her country. The Syrian Amjad Jad has been living in Sofia for ten years now and plays oriental music on an Arab instrument called the oud. Boyana Zheliazkova plays the violin, sings and composes. The three of them are going on stage with their song “Beyond differences” and sending out the message that music and the enthusiasm for beauty are not subject to boundaries.  “With the song that I have sung, I want to tell people to love each other and cherish life. It is important to live in peace and love,” says Silsila. Boyana adds: “Within a single repetition, an extremely interesting composition was born from three completely different songs. There is an Indian song in Hindi, a Syrian one in Arabic and the third one is from the Rhodope Mountain, in Bulgarian.”  Is the process of creation easy with an unknown person, coming from a foreign culture and different history? As it turns out, yes it is: “Actually, the fact that we are from different countries does not make us different types of people – on the contrary, we have so much more to share with each other,” Radina Stoimenova responds. She does not simply work with Ali on their join artistic project – in fact, today, he is one of her friends. “The sad part is that more prejudice can be seen in Bulgaria, compared to France, where there is a longer history of integration of different cultures,” she continues. “I believe that there is nothing to overcome – we are all human beings and it is only natural for us to help one another in hard times. This is a simple humane rule, which does not require effort since people are everywhere. I become sad when I hear of cases when refugees are badly met, but I hold hope that with time, Bulgaria, as well as the rest of the countries, will learn to overcome the differences. When people meet in person, such differences are forgotten. And there is no reason for them to exist in the first place.”  English Boris Totchev   Personal stories from the past, shots from everyday life of ordinary people, or holiday celebrations, vacations and even trips abroad.

"138",390,"https://bnr.bg/en/post/101304101/on-bulgarians-in-albania-in-a-historical-context-and-more","On Bulgarians in Albania in a historical context and more","  The communist government in Bulgaria wasted the strategic chance of the Bulgarian community in Albania to study its mother tongue in schools  In 1948 Bulgaria refusedto send teachers for the Bulgarian community in Albania, which was subsequently subjected to Macedonization. Assoc. Prof. Spas Tashev reveals such little-known facts in the newly printed first book of his research - “Bulgarian communities in the Western Balkans. Political processes and ethnic-demographic consequences (1913-2019).” The scientist follows the ethnic-demographic processes in more than 30 settlements in Albania, where people communicate in an archaic Bulgarian dialect.  After the end of the Second World War and the change of regimes, the Bulgarian state missed a historical chance to establish the Bulgarian literary language in Bulgarian-inhabited Albania. The government wasted two opportunities in a time when the Yugoslavian emissaries were trying to tear off Pirin Macedonia from Bulgaria and annex Albania as the seventh republic of their own country. “As extraordinary as it may sound, the first resistance in the Balkans against such Yugoslavian politics came from Albania, when Enver Hodzha, the head of state, visited Bulgaria in 1947,” explains Assoc. Prof. Spas Tashev from the Institute for Population and Human Studies in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. “During an extensive discussion, he proposed that Bulgaria should send teachers to Albania. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party responded to the initiative with a year delay, but during that time, the chairman of the committee assigned to discuss the issue at hand – Traycho Kostov - falls into disfavour, due to his conflict with Stalin, and Bulgaria misses its strategic chance to affirm Bulgarian presence and language in Albania.”   According to the historian, sending Bulgarian teachers would have resulted in an alternative to the Macedonization – the introduction of a Macedonian language subject in schools, conducted by Yugoslavia. Such an alternative would have ultimately influenced the Central Balkans at large. The political conjuncture, however, prevailed and Bulgaria’s chance was left unexploited. In 1955, Albania did once again turn to Bulgaria with a request to send textbooks for the Bulgarian population. But again to no avail, as the government overlooked this opportunity for opposing the attempts of the ethnic transformation of the Bulgarians on these lands.Then, on the basis of a Bulgarian Prespa dialect and through a self-sown practice and the official Bulgarian alphabet, an original regiolect came along, which was used by the Bulgarians in Albania up until 1991.  According to Assoc. Prof. Spas Tashev, with the establishment of a democratic state in Albania, new processes of gaining self-awareness in the community begin. He is assured that Bulgarians in Albania have never been discriminated against. In 1991, the first Bulgarian associations were registered there, two years later - the first young Bulgarians from Albania arrived here to study in Bulgarian universities. That is when purposeful actions towards official recognition of the Bulgarian minority in Albania began, which were crowned with success in 2017. Today, studying literary Bulgarian language is a priority of the national community in foreign Albania - there are three Bulgarian Sunday schools, and more than 700 young people have graduated from Bulgarian universities. In the upcoming months, the Bulgarian community will be facing a new obstacle - to protect its ethnic presence in the Albanian census. According to the available data, in the moment there are 50 thousand native Bulgarian speakers in Albania. Nevertheless, whether they would declare themselves as Bulgarians in the surveys is dependent on numerous factors, but most importantly on Bulgarian diplomacy, which has the task of requiring control from the Albanian authorities with the purpose of hindering any attempts to replace the national identity of Bulgarians there.

In the summer of 1877 this place was the scene of the Shipka battle, one of the clashes that were decisive for the outcome of the Russo-Turkish War for the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule. The monument is an integral part of the Shipka–Bouzloudzha Museum Park. Every year in August, thousands of patriotic Bulgarians flock to this revered place to commemorate the feat of the heroes who fought and died for the freedom of the Motherland. Reenactments of the events in 1877 which have been organized since 2006 by the Traditsiya (Tradition) National Association attract about 250 participants every year. This year, especially for the event, the Ministry of Defense has provided tents for the people of Traditsiya who will be camping near the command center of Gen. Stoletov and will have access to the military field kitchen. „Back in August 1877, the peak where the Monument of Freedom stands today was the scene of fierce battles. The defense of the peak hung by a thread. This maybe determined the outcome of the entire war,” Dr. Chavdar Angelov, director of the Shipka–Bouzloudzha Museum Park said. “This year the reenactment of the battles from 25 August will take place at the original site of the command point of Gen. Stoletov, at the historic Shipka peak where on 11 August (under the Julian calendar) 1877, the fiercest and most decisive battles for the defense of Shipka Pass took place. Yes, we will present a show, but what we pursue is the authenticity of the event. Hopefully, the visitors will remember a few key moments from those historic events that eventually led to the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878. One reason to hold the reenactment at the historic peak of Shipka is because 141 ago the cavalry of Gen. Radetzky came from here. Therefore the troops will be deployed where they actually stood. We made efforts to clean up the plot where the battles took place as it was overgrown with grass, weeds and bushes.” More than 25,000 are expected to arrive for the national celebrations of the 141st anniversary of the Shipka Campaign. It will be held under the patronage of Bulgarian President Rumen Radev and with the participation of the National Guard. The program started on 2 August with the opening of the exhibition “The unforgettable Bulgarian volunteers”. It features processed original photos of volunteers in the war collected from museums from across Bulgaria. „They are impressive with that volunteers in them were photographed at a very old age, in the early 20 c. But pictures still convey the relentless spirit of those heroic people, the Bulgarian Knights of Freedom”, says Dir., Chavdar Angelov.  „Viewers can see the images of some of the key protagonists in the Russo-Turkish War – starting with the Grand Duke Nikolay Nikolaevich of Russia, Russian generals Stoletov, Radetzky, Totleben, Skobelev and Gurko as well as some of the commanders of the Bulgarian volunteer units. This exhibition is remarkable. And part of the photos has been colored which works to strengthen the impression. At the opening in Kazanlak the audience was quite appreciative. In fact the celebrations on 25 August also mark the beginnings of a very important institution, the Bulgarian Army, which celebrates its 140th anniversary this year. At the core of the Bulgarian Army were the Bulgarian volunteers in the Russo-Turkish War. Some of them showed great valor in the battle near Slivnitsa, Western Bulgaria, during the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885. They also joined the Balkan wars and the First World War. This place is of great importance to Bulgaria and it lays the beginnings of many victorious campaigns after the great Shipka one.”  English Daniela Konstantinova   София, бул.

The rally on September 10 marked the 64th consecutive day of protests against the ruling conservative GERB party and its government in the Southeastern European nation’s deepening political crisis. Protesters, monitored closely by police, gathered outside the National Assembly building in Sofia, shouting, “Mafia out!” and demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov’s government and Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev. The September 10 rally appeared to take place without major incident. On September 2-3, several thousand people joined the so-called Grand National Uprising in response to what protesters say is oligarchic control over Bulgaria’s government and judicial system. Violence on that day led to scores of injuries and the arrest of 126 people, including what police described as more than 60 football hooligans. Opinion polls show that more than 60 percent of Bulgarians support demands for Borisov and Geshev to resign and for immediate parliamentary elections to be called. Borisov has said he is prepared to step down following parliamentary elections currently set for March 2021. On July 21, Borisov’s government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, the fifth such vote since it took power in 2017. The demonstrators have protested against Borisov's government over perceived ties to the country’s powerful oligarchs. They also claim that Geshev has targeted government critics, including Socialist-backed President Rumen Radev, who has supported the protests. The protests were sparked by a raid on July 9 by the Prosecutor-General's Office on the presidential headquarters. Radev’s legal affairs and anti-corruption secretary and his security and defense adviser were detained for questioning and their offices searched as part of two separate probes into alleged influence-peddling and disclosure of state secrets. The demonstrators have condemned the raids as an attack by the government and the prosecutor-general against Radev. Radev has often criticized Borisov's government for doing too little to uproot endemic corruption and has blasted prosecutors for cherry-picking their probes and colluding with the government.

Now, Atanas Chikov is one of the most active Bulgarians in the UK turning his desire to help other Bulgarians who want to settle and work there into his profession. That was how the platform BGhelp, http://www.bghelp.co.uk/forums/content/ came into being and grew to become a resounding success, with tens of thousands of Bulgarians registering on it. They exchange ideas, experience, advice, anyone can join in and do anything they can to help. Meanwhile Atanas created a series of Facebook pages on various topics connected with life in Britain, as well as a YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/AtanasChikov/videos, to which he uploads videos with recommendations and valuable advice about local realities. Atanas became a licensed migration consultant. He says he can barely keep up with all of the questions and queries because after Brexit Bulgarians face a host of problems. There are more than 20,000 Bulgarians living in the UK. Atanas says many come with the idea of working for a few years, making some money and then going back home. Some start successful businesses or find a steady job and decide to stay. People work hard and pay their taxes, and that is something the UK also benefits from. But with all the Brexit-related problems and lack of information, many have been coming up against insurmountable administrative barriers: “There are a lot of problems,” Atanas says. “With the corona crisis some go to work, others work from home. But rent is high, and if at some point they are left out of a job, how can they afford to pay it? Or all the obstacles connected with the paperwork that will allow them to go on working after Brexit. Most Bulgarians have already obtained their new status but some face serious administrative problems. Other complications involve travelling and the expiry of the identity cards, because you can’t just fly back to Bulgaria to renew them.”  But the most serious apprehensions are connected with the uncertainty of Brexit – will there be a deal or not! Bulgarians worry how that will affect the exchange rate of the pound. “Many have been converting their salaries into euro and sending the money back home to relatives. But if there is no deal and the pound drops below one euro, that would really burn a hole in their pocket,” Atanas says. It is not at all clear where the British economy is going, and there is a risk of entire sectors being affected, like hotels and restaurants where 10-15% of all Bulgarians living in the UK are employed. Do Bulgarians find integration easy? “I don’t think so. The perspective on life here is different. We are the Southern type, we are more temperamental, like the Spanish or the Greek, we like to sit down at table and eat together, to listen to music… Britain is the perfect place to do business, to make some money, and then, if you want to, to go back home,” Atanas Chikov says.

On this day the Sofia “St. Catherine” Hospital celebrates its Patron Saint’s Day. This day has retained its popularity throughout the centuries. It commemorates the martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. According to traditional accounts, St. Catherine was beheaded by Emperor Maximinus II around 305 AD in Alexandria. 24 November became the commemoration date in the 10th century, and many churches and particularly nunneries in Europe were dedicated to St Catherine.

Yes, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev may not be there, but the other main party, VMRO-DPMNE, led by Mr. Mickoski, has categorically said that they will seek recognition of the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. So, there is a lot of ambiguity among the Macedonian leadership on this issue. Therefore, we talk about the historical facts, it is clear that the idea of Macedonianism was raised since the XIX century by Serbia, by Serbian chauvinist circles, which had a clear national program for Greater Serbia, the eradication of Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia and the de-Bulgarianization of the Bulgarians in Macedonia. So, there are thousands of documents that prove the success of this Serbian policy in the twentieth century with all the murders, imprisonments of Bulgarians in Macedonia. So, we speak like this with facts, it is well known when the Macedonian language is officially made and actually processed. We must say here that Bulgaria does not deny the identity of these people, they have the right to have languages, histories, figures, personalities and so on.

Mandatory wearing of masks in public places enjoys the greatest support. In November, Bulgarians feel more secure about their jobs than in the spring. Lower levels of concern among Bulgarians are recorded concerning shortages of food products, home supplies, medicines and fuels compared to April. There has been an increase in the share of people who are left with no savings. This is according to data from a survey of the research center ""Trend"" commissioned by the newspaper ""24 Hours"", dedicated to the attitudes of Bulgarians towards the spread of COVID-19.The survey was carried out between 2-10 November 2020 through face-to-face interviews among 1,001 people aged 18+. ""30% of Bulgarians believe that measures against the spread of COVID-19 should be stricter. A similar percentage share was reported in April. In May, however, only 11% wanted tougher measures. This is largely due to the few cases then and the state's exit from the state of emergency. Demographic charts show that as age increases, the proportion of people who think the measures should be stricter is also increasing. There is an impression that 39% are the ones who in May believed that the measures should be lighter, with only 15% sharing this opinion in November"", commented the experts of ""Trend"". The share of people keeping the ‘hand-washing’ rule as a measure of protection against coronavirus reported in November compared to April this year is 93% to 92%. In November, there was an increase in the proportion of people declaring that they were wearing protective masks – 88% set against 70% in April. About 82% is the share of Bulgarians who say that they observe physical distance when communicating with other people, and 14% indicate that they do not observe one.79% of people say they avoid reuniting with a lot of people. As a precaution against coronavirus, 37% of people take vitamins/food supplements, and 70% use disinfectants more often. The share of those working from home in November was lower than in April - 18% compared to 35%.At the same time, there has been a decrease in support for closing all restaurants, bars, gyms and other places where more people gather. 36% of people supported this measure in November, while in April this share was 82%.

In today's uncertain world, we again need individuals to elevate eternal human values. But are there such modern enlighteners? For seven years now, the Bulgarian National Radio has been looking for people with a mission who can be called modern enlighteners. These personalities inspire others, create change and do good. According to Milen Vrabevski - the first winner of the award, selected with the votes of the audience, and chairman of the jury, modern enlighteners participate in the lives of others and add value to social development without expecting gratitude.  ""Everything that moves society forward and helps it to adequately adapt to the high-tech 21st century is an awakening,"" Milen Vrabevski, chairman of the Bulgarian Memory Foundation said. “Our task is to improve the civilizational qualification and standard of living, so that people can get rid of fear, while their talent to be useful to others comes to the fore. We hope that positive energy can cause a chain effect of goodwill and efficiency. Then opportunities start to be given to us from above, because we are fulfilling our divine function on Earth and giving many people the opportunity to experience the satisfaction of their existence.” Archpriest Serafim Yanev takes care of the well-being of a dozen churches, contributes to the opening of social centers and every summer opens the gates of the Kremikovtzi Monastery ""St. George the Victorious”, where he serves as an abbot. Due to his many philanthropic deeds, Archpriest Serafim was nominated this year for Enlightener of the Year.  “It is no coincidence that the first enlightener is St. John of Rila - the greatest Bulgarian saint, who with his personal sacrifice and by welcoming God in himself spreads grace among the whole nation to this day, the priest says. ""By their example, enlighteners can help us not only to achieve the temporary, but also to find the path to eternity, which is the meaning of human life."" Poet and journalist Marin Bodakov believes that the task of enlighteners of the spirit is simple - to make the world more complicated, not to allow it to be reduced to a bipolar world, but to take care of the nuances.  ""In this world, we need to be vigilant about the truth,"" he says. ""Because I feel that at the moment much more attention is being paid to interpretations than to facts, much more attention is being paid to the aimless survival of power itself than to truth among ourselves."" Called the ""Countess of Fine Ceramics"", Tsvetana Videva creates original objects from clay using technology dating back 6,000 years. She often gathers young people in her studio in the Old Town of Plovdiv to give them her faith in beauty.  ""I let them listen to good music, I mention the names of great musicians and artists. I hope they become interested,” Tsvetana Videva says. “I want young people to become more spiritual and respect beauty. That's my mission - to help people."" As part of a campaign, Viktor Ivanov who is also nominated for the Enlightener of the Year Award, set himself the educational task of traveling over 10,000 km to donate copies of three modern books to libraries, priests, imams and entrepreneurs, so that they can reach more people.  “We need a new Revival and a new period of enlightenment if we want to move forward as a nation in the 21st century in opposition to the division at the moment. My ideal for Bulgaria is for people to feel more solidarity towards each other, to be more united, to have more understanding in the name of our common future - here, not abroad.""

Excerpts in italics with my bolds. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) exerts antiviral effects through several mechanisms. Our initial experience suggests that HCQ could be used for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection in health care workers (HCW) and could help to control the virus in the early disease stages. We suggest a prophylactic strategy with HCQ for autumn-winter-spring 2020-2021. Providing adequate health care is vitally important during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep morbidity and mortality low. Health care workers (HCW) are key guarantees for this process, and they must feel safe and adequately protected, which includes reliable prophylactic measures (1). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could exert antiviral effects, essential for prophylaxis and early treatment of COVID-19, through several mechanisms: 1) endosomal pH increase, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry through the host cells’ membranes; 2) inhibition of ACE2 cell receptor glycosylation, which impedes SARS-CoV-2-receptor binding; 3) blocking the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from early endosomes to endolysosomes, which prevents the release of viral genome; 4) immunomodulation; 5) limiting the post-viral cytokine-storm syndrome (2, 3). We share the experience of the Bulgarian Cardiac Institute (BCI) regarding the use of HCQ for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in HCW. BCI comprises seven hospitals and eight medical centers, with around 1200 HCW, covering more than two-thirds of Bulgarian territory. Since March 2020, many of our employees were in close contact with COVID-19 cases. We offered prophylaxis with HCQ 200 mg qd for 14 days to 204 of them. 76.4% of the group (156 HCW) used HCQ and none of them presented with COVID-19 symptoms. Unfortunately, out of the rest 48 HCW that refused HCQ prophylaxis, three developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. During the last seven months, 38 HCW at BCI tested positive for COVID-19, half of them symptomatic. We suggested the following treatment regimen as an early home-based therapy for them: azithromycin 500 mg qd; HCQ 200 mg tid and Zn up to 50 mg qd for 14 days. 33 (86.8%) of them undertook this treatment, with symptoms abolishing between 2nd and 4th day, none of them requiring hospitalization and with a negative PCR on 14th day for all. In conclusion, our experience at BCI suggests that HCQ could possibly provide protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (prophylaxis), and could, if used early, help control the COVID-19 infection (treatment).  Based on this experience, we at BCI adopted a new prophylactic strategy for HCW starting from the 2nd half of October 2020. This includes alternative months of HCQ intake (200 mg qd) and months without therapy. We are planning to continue this prophylaxis regimen throughout the autumn, winter, and spring months. Article is HCQ is effective for COVID-19 when used early: analysis of 118 studies. Excerpts in italics with my bolds. •Early treatment is most successful, with 100% of studies reporting a positive effect and an estimated reduction of 63% in the effect measured (death, hospitalization, etc.) using a random effects meta-analysis, RR 0.37 [0.30-0.47].•100% of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for early, PrEP, or PEP treatment report positive effects, the probability of this happening for an ineffective treatment is 0.002.•There is evidence of bias towards publishing negative results. Significantly more retrospective studies report negative results compared to prospective studies, p = 0.04.•Significantly more studies in North America report negative results compared to the rest of the world, p = 0.002. Figure 2: Treatment stages. Figure 2 shows stages of possible treatment for COVID-19. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to regularly taking medication before being infected, in order to prevent or minimize infection. In Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), medication is taken after exposure but before symptoms appear. Early Treatment refers to treatment immediately or soon after symptoms appear, while Late Treatment refers to more delayed treatment. Table 1. Results by treatment stage. 2 studies report results for a subset with early treatment, these are not included in the overall results. Publication bias. Publishing is often biased towards positive results, which we would need to adjust for when analyzing the percentage of positive results. Studies that require less effort are considered to be more susceptible to publication bias. Prospective trials that involve significant effort are likely to be published regardless of the result, while retrospective studies are more likely to exhibit bias. For example, researchers may perform preliminary analysis with minimal effort and the results may influence their decision to continue. Retrospective studies also provide more opportunities for the specifics of data extraction and adjustments to influence results. For HCQ, 87.5% of prospective studies report positive effects, compared to 69.8% of retrospective studies, two-tailed z test 2.07, p = 0.04, indicating a bias toward publishing negative results. The lack of bias towards positive results is not very surprising. Both negative and positive results are very important given the current use of HCQ for COVID-19 around the world, evidence of which can be found in the studies analyzed here, government protocols, and news reports, for example [AFP, AfricaFeeds, Africanews, Afrik.com, Al Arabia, Al-bab, Anadolu Agency, Anadolu Agency (B), Archyde, Barron’s, Barron’s (B), BBC, Belayneh, A., CBS News, Challenge, Dr. Goldin, Efecto Cocuyo, Expats.cz, Face 2 Face Africa, France 24, France 24 (B), Franceinfo, Global Times, Government of China, Government of India, GulfInsider, Le Nouvel Afrik, LifeSiteNews, Medical World Nigeria, Medical Xpress, Medical Xpress (B), Middle East Eye, Ministerstva Zdravotnictví, Morocco World News, Mosaique Guinee, Nigeria News World, NPR News, Oneindia, Pan African Medical Journal, Parola, Pilot News, Pleno.News, Q Costa Rica, Rathi, Russian Government, Teller Report, The Africa Report, The Australian, The BL, The East African, The Guardian, The Indian Express, The Moscow Times, The North Africa Post, The Tico Times, Ukraine Ministry of Health Care, Ukrinform, Vanguard, Voice of America]. We also note a bias towards publishing negative results by certain journals and press organizations, with scientists reporting difficulty publishing positive results [Boulware, Meneguesso]. Although 88 studies show positive results, The New York Times, for example, has only written articles for studies that claim HCQ is not effective [The New York Times, The New York Times (B), The New York Times (C)]. As of September 10, 2020, The New York Times still claims that there is clear evidence that HCQ is not effective for COVID-19 [The New York Times (D)]. As of October 9, 2020, the United States National Institutes of Health still recommends against HCQ for both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients [United States National Institutes of Health]. Treatment details. We focus here on the question of whether HCQ is effective or not for COVID-19. Significant differences exist based on treatment stage, with early treatment showing the greatest effectiveness. 100% of early treatment studies report a positive effect, with an estimated reduction of 63% in the effect measured (death, hospitalization, etc.) in the random effects meta-analysis, RR 0.37 [0.30-0.47]. Many factors are likely to influence the degree of effectiveness, including the dosing regimen, concomitant medications such as zinc or azithromycin, precise treatment delay, the initial viral load of patients, and current patient conditions.  News website Panorama.it has launched a petition to get the drug hydroxychloroquine officially reinstated so that Italian doctors can once again use it with patients. If not, some of them will go ahead and use it anyway. The retracted Lancet study and trials using lethal doses(!) of HCQ were enough to get it officially banned in Italy as in other countries. Except the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has not yet reapproved it, despite studies showing its effectiveness. Here are excerpts of the Change.org petition translated from Italian: At the moment there are no treatments of proven effectiveness to be administered at home. Because the only therapy that AIFA (Italy’s Medicines Agency) had authorized at home, the one based on hydroxychloroquine, has been blocked. It happened on May 26, after the publication of a study in The Lancet, which was withdrawn 13 days later. Meanwhile, German GPs, who had administered 1,060,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine in March, continued to prescribe it. In the United States, three states lifted the ban on the drug in early August. In China, on August 19, the National Health Commission’s guidelines continued to recommend the active ingredient for Covid 19 patients. And on September 21, The Lancet itself retraced its steps, with a study claiming that hydroxychloroquine reduces mortality. In order to save lives, we ask AIFA to restore the use of hydroxychloroquine for home patients in the very early stages of the disease, possibly even with an emergency procedure. Otherwise, we invite the Agency to provide shared protocols of treatment practicable in the territory. via Science Matters https://ift.tt/3lBkm1m November 13, 2020 at 05:35PM Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Prof. Mihail Okoliyski, WHO representative for Bulgaria, has told bTV. Compared to other Europeans, Bulgarians tend to believe more in conspiracy theories about vaccines. Level of vaccination is traditionally low in this country. At the same time very little has been invested in public health and prevention in Bulgaria over the years, Okoliyski says.  The latest poll from October shows growing public skepticism. 62% said they were helpless in the face of coronavirus and 60% said they were afraid of the disease. This leads to increased aggression, alcohol and antidepressant use, Okoliyski says.
