FILE PHOTO  Kampala- Some MPs on the taskforce investigating alleged dubious acquisition and repossession of the departed Asians’ properties have received 78 petitions in Canada, alleging fraudulent acts concerning the current occupation or control of at least 106 properties in Uganda. The taskforce of the parliamentary Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises, which has been carrying out investigations since July, left for Canada and UK last week on a fact-finding trip about the properties. The two five-member teams each accompanied by a top official from the Departed Asians Properties’ Custodian Board (DAPCB) was sanctioned by the Speaker of Parliament, Ms Rebecca Kadaga, after most witnesses in Kampala claimed they were managing the properties on behalf of the original proprietors, who did not return to the country after the 1972 expulsion. Mr Ibrahim Kasozi, the Makindye East MP, who chairs the taskforce, said the 78 petitions were received by the team during the public hearings in the Canadian capital Toronto last week. “The petitions are very many but we only received 78 during our time in Toronto. We have instructed the rest of the departed Asians who have any complaints in Toronto to send them to the Clerk to the Committee via email because we needed to travel to Vancouver where many people are ready to appear,” Mr Kasozi said by telephone from Canada.He declined to reveal particulars in the petitions. He said the details will be reserved for the committee report after analysis of the evidence in the petitions and what the people managing the properties in Uganda will have adduced. However, sources within the team said some new claims have come up regarding the properties which were never included in the whistleblower’s petition to Parliament. The sources said some of the properties whose original proprietors denied ever issuing powers of attorney to anyone to manage them on their behalf include Plot 135 and 141 on Mbuya Hill and Plots 66 and 63 on Ismail Road in Mbuya, Kampala.Our sources did not reveal the particulars of the original owners or the current occupants of the properties because of what they called “preempting the report”. However, some of the video footage leaked shows unnamed witnesses implicating Mr Muhamad Allibhai, the chairman of the Association of Expropriated Properties Owners Limited in Uganda. Mr Allibhai declined to comment on the claims, saying he needed to crosscheck his management documents after a meeting. [email protected] We come to you.

It is currently spreading across North America, damaging forest ecosystems and posing a significant economic threat. Two subspecies L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica, collectively referred to as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) are of special concern as they have traits that make them better invaders than their European counterpart (e.g. flight capability of females). We assessed the potential distribution of AGM in Canada using two presence-only species distribution models, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). In addition, we mapped AGM potential future distribution under two climate change scenarios (A1B and A2) while implementing dispersal constraints using the cellular automation model MigClim. MaxEnt had higher AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores (0.82/1.40/1.00) when compared to GARP (0.70/1.26/0.9), indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for AGM. The models indicated that suitable conditions for AGM were present in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The human influence index was the variable found to contribute the most in predicting the distribution of AGM. These model results can be used to identify areas at risk for this pest, to inform strategic and tactical pest management decisions. Forest Invasive Alien Species (FIAS) are of serious concern to biodiversity around the world and their impacts on native plant species, communities, and on associated environments are widely recognized to have both economic and ecological impacts1,2. In Canada, over 80 Forest Invasive Alien Species (FIAS) have been introduced since 1882, most notably Dutch elm disease, white pine blister rust, rusty tussock moth, Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer and European gypsy moth3. It is estimated that these FIAS destroy roughly 400,000 hectares (ha) of forest every year4. The establishment of FIAS has continued to rise5,6, and their impacts are anticipated to be substantial throughout all environments7,8. Moreover, the global, national, and regional spatial patterns of FIAS invasions in the future are likely to be different due to technological advances in transportation and international trade9, increase in human population10, and climate change11. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is listed as one of the 100 worst invasive alien species in the world, selected from global invasive species database by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Gypsy moth can cause serious defoliation and weakening of trees and shrubs, that either leads to tree death directly or indirectly by subsequent infestation by a secondary pest. Currently, gypsy moth is spreading in North America (primarily in the United States) damaging both commercial and native forest ecosystems over much of the introduced range. The pest also poses a significant economic threat to several other countries that are taking actions to prevent its introduction12. Two subspecies, Asian gypsy moth (L. dispar asiatica Vinkovskij), distributed throughout temperate Asia, and the Japanese gypsy moth (L. dispar japonica Motschulsky), distributed throughout Japan, are of serious concern although they have not yet permanently established (though several incursions have been eradicated) outside their native range13,14. The two subspecies, L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica here after collectively referred to as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) have a broad host range (over 600 plant species, including conifers) and the females are flight capable15. They have an affinity to fly towards light sources and strong dispersal traits, which makes them a greater threat than their European counterpart. The AGM females have been found to fly to lights in port areas and lay their egg masses on cargo and the superstructure of ships. A study by Paini et al.13,14 found that more than 7,500 ships that have the potential to carry AGM egg masses from Asia arrived in 2005 at Canadian ports that fall into the climatically suitable range of AGM. Several detections of AGM egg masses on vessels coming from Asian ports have occurred in Canada (the first eradication effort occurred around the Vancouver port in 199216) which have led to the implementation of international phytosanitary measures to prevent AGM establishment that are significantly reducing the risk of invasion. Because there is a continuing risk of introduction, it is important to predict potential distribution and factors that influence their ability to establish17. Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to provide information on potential distribution range of FIAS, which in turn is critical for conservation and management planning and for understanding FIAS ecology18. SDMs build on the general concept of a fundamental niche and forecasted species distributions that are dependent on the underlying modelling algorithm that is applied19. SDMs are trained with species occurrence data and associated environmental layers from one range, and then projected onto a different range in order to identify regions with relative environmental suitability for a given FIAS. The theory behind this method is the similarity between native and non-native regions of the FIAS20. In the past, researchers have used both correlative (GARP) and partially-mechanistic (CLIMEX) approaches to predict the global potential distribution range of AGM13,14. Peterson et al.14 used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) whereas Paini et al.13 used CLIMEX to map global climate suitability for AGM. These studies looked at global species distributions of AGM with no study focused on a Canada-wide scale. We therefore aimed to compare two SDM approaches, MaxEnt and GARP, to check if they provide reliable distribution estimates in AGMs native range and realistic potential distribution maps for AGM in Canada. MaxEnt and GARP are capable of providing robust predictions with presence-only data and have often outperformed classical modeling approaches, such as domain, bioclim, and logistic regression21. Only a few studies have reported mixed performances of GARP and MaxEnt with respect to their predictive success in unsampled regions22,23. To support improved future surveillance of AGM, we also investigated the null hypothesis that there would be no difference in the potential habitat of AGM under changing climates. To do this we used the two SDMs (MaxEnt and GARP) we had developed and mapped potential distribution of AGM in Canada under two climate change scenarios A1B and A2. Basically, the A1B scenario is characterized by a very rapid economic growth, low population growth and rapid use of more efficient technology whereas, the A2 scenario refers to a heterogeneous world with high population growth and less concern for economic development24. Modelling results for AGM distribution from GARP and MaxEnt showed a similar distributional pattern in the species’ native range. However, different suitability scores were obtained from both SDMs. GARP assigned larger areas a high suitability score than MaxEnt (Fig. 1). Areas in which modelling results are in agreement, include Japan, North and South Korea, central and western parts of Russia, eastern and southern China, Indo-Himalayan range, Laos, Parts of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Northern Afghanistan and Kazakhstan, Turkey and the north-western regions of Iran. Additionally, suitability was considered high in southern parts of India and Sri Lanka. These predictions are well in agreement with the occurrence records found in the literature25. Predicted potential distribution of AGM in Asia and Canada, using GARP and MaxEnt. For Asia, higher probability (red colors) represent areas suitable for AGM. Zero probability or lower probability (dark green) indicates areas less suitable. Whereas, for Canada the continuous suitability values (0–1) from GARP and MaxEnt outputs were classified as: very low (0–0.25), low (0.25–0.50), medium (0.50–0.75) and high (0.75–1.00) for easy interpretation and comparison purposes. Predictions obtained from transferring these models to nonnative range (in Canada) using both approaches however, did show substantial differences (Figs. 1 and 2). Potential distribution (enlarged view) of AGM using GARP and MaxEnt in Canada at 20 km2 spatial resolution. Areas modelled to be highly suitable using GARP were found in British Columbia (BC), Alberta, Saskatchewan, southern regions of Manitoba and Ontario (excluding Toronto) and parts of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. MaxEnt results identified coastal BC, areas around cities of Vancouver and Toronto, Southern Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and southern parts of New Brunswick and Newfoundland to be of high suitability. Differences between the distribution predictions was recorded for all suitability classes across Canada, with major differences observed in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta (Figs. 1 and 2). Similar patterns of predicting higher suitability scores for larger regions was recorded from GARP across the entire nonnative range. The occurrence data and modelled distributions indicate that areas receiving annual precipitation between 800 and 3,800 mm and a mean annual temperature range of 5 to 25 °C are suitable for AGM establishment. These areas have HII index value above 25 (Fig. 3) and cover a large range of climatic zones (Table 1). Relationships between environmental predictors and the probability of the presence of AGM: Red curves show the mean response and blue bands around them are ±1 standard deviation calculated using 10 independent data subsets. The jackknife test identified the Human Influence Index (HII) and annual precipitation (Bio 12) as the most important predictors of AGM distribution (Fig. 4). HII made the largest contribution to the MaxEnt model of AGM distribution when used in isolation and reduced the model’s predictive ability the most when omitted. HII, annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation were the strongest predictors of AGM potential range contributing 46.5, 26.2 and 17.8% respectively, showing that in addition to precipitation, anthropogenic factors can have a huge impact on the distribution of this species. Jackknife test for AUC of environmental variable importance for the MaxEnt model. The AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores for MaxEnt and GARP models were higher than 0.7, 1 and 0.8 suggesting that both of the approaches had good predictive capability (interpolation). However MaxEnt had higher AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores (0.82, 1.40 and 1) compared to GARP (0.70, 1.26 and 0.9) indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for AGM. MigClim simulations show that at the end of simulation run (i.e. the potential distribution of AGM under specified dispersal restrictions) a total of 16,450 cells were colonized in the A1B scenario, whereas 16,654 cells were colonized under A2 scenario (Fig. 5). Dispersal restricted future distribution of AGM under A1B and A2 climate change scenarios. Color gradient from rose to dark red represents first 10 years of the simulation timeframe when colonization first occurred, the light sand to cherry red color gradient represents the next 10 years followed by green and sky blue color gradients (years 2031–2050). Red pixel indicates the hypothesized point of AGM introduction while the dark grey pixels represent suitable areas that were not colonized due to dispersal limitations. In the first 10 years of the modelling timeframe, areas in coastal BC, around Vancouver, Duncan, Port Alberni, Courtenay, Quesnel and Williams Lake are likely going to provide suitable habitat to AGM. In next 10 year period (years 2021–2030) areas east of Kamloops, Kelowna and Prince George will provide suitable habitat for AGM dispersal and establishment. Areas around Prince Rupert and Terrace may also be suitable in the same period. Under the A2 climate change scenario the potential area colonized during the second and third 10 year timeframes would be larger compared to A1 scenario. In 2031–2050, areas south of Whitehorse near Teslin and Juneau, as well as areas around Watson Lake would be expected to be colonized. Areas around Graham Island and Moresby Island including Naikoon Provincial Park (PP) and Gwaii Haanas National Park (NP) and NP situated southwest to Whitehorse (Kluane) and Tatshenshini-Alsek PP may not get colonized due to dispersal limitations. Both modelling approaches predicted large areas suitable for AGM in Canada. These findings are similar to studies conducted in the past by Peterson et al.14 and Paini et al.13. GARP and MaxEnt performed well for AGM’s native range with relatively high AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores. However MaxEnt out performed GARP in determining potential distributions of AGM in the native range. This finding is in line with other studies that found MaxEnt outperforming alternative approaches18,26. We found GARP to overestimate suitable areas in both native (e.g. Russia and Indo-Himalayan range) and nonnative range of AGM (e.g. Yukon, Nunavut, Alberta and Saskatchewan). In contrast MaxEnt predictions were close to the known distributional range of AGM in the native range. Since AGM is not currently established in Canada, we did not have any data to test transferability success of the approaches. As a surrogate for AGM we compared the predictions from both models by overlaying interception location records of EGM (European gypsy moth) provided by the CFIA (collected as a part of annual pest survey), since EGM and AGM are assumed to have similar ecological characteristics and hosts27,28. We found that MaxEnt predictions matched more closely to EGM distributions in Canada than GARP. The better performance of MaxEnt can be attributed to its ability to fit complex functions including interactions amongst predictors and use of penalty functions to avoid overfitting29. GARP predictions are often criticized for overestimating the distribution range26 as it tends to omit less important relationships in the data (temperature, in our case)30. Our results indicated that the total suitable area for AGM will increase in the A2 scenario, which led to a rejection of our original hypothesis –that there would be no difference in the potential habitat of AGM under a changing climate. Climate models have projected that by 2100, eastern Canada will be approximately 3–5 °C warmer, with increased winter precipitation31, this rise in temperature which could eventually lead to much higher probabilities of AGM invasions. Suitable conditions for AGM were modelled in areas with annual temperatures between 5 and 25 °C, but the optimum range (probability of presence >0.60, based on maximum test sensitivity and specificity threshold32) was between 11–25 °C. This optimum range is in agreement with the recent findings of Limbu et al.12 that AGM populations may struggle in regions that experience longer periods of temperatures ≥30 °C and that AGM survival was highest between 15 and 25 °C. Canadian areas classified as suitable were located within the Koppen-Geiger climatic zones- DFb (average temperatures below 22 °C) and DFc, which represents subarctic climate where 1–3 months have an average temperature above 10 °C. We included an additional variable HII to account for dispersal and human footprint and found that it contributed the most to determining the distribution of AGM. Areas predicted to be suitable had HII values above 25. This backs the notion that FIAS distributions are heavily impacted by the influence of humans on the landscape33 and that human activity can significantly affect the distribution of FIAS. The AGM distribution maps generated by our models were different from those produced by Peterson et al.14 and Paini et al.13, who found large areas in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to be suitable while our MaxEnt model showed only limited suitability in these provinces. This could possibly be due to the following limitations of these studies: (1) GARP has been criticized for over predicting distribution ranges18 and failure to model less important relationships in the data30. Additionally GARP has been also found to be less accurate than MaxEnt in several studies34. (2) Bioclimatic variables included in the SDMs by Peterson et al.14 did not account for anthropogenic impacts on the response variable (probability of species occurrence). (3) The authors have ignored the dispersal limitations of the FIAS in the modelled distributions. This is despite the fact that FIAS invasions increase as dispersal capabilities increase, often aided by human activities35. (4) It is important to constrain the pseudo-absence (PA) locations to the same geographic range as presences for accurate predictions36, however this approach was not followed by Peterson et al.14 while selecting PA samples. These findings suggest that pest surveillance in these provinces may need to be reevaluated. These spatial uncertainties of the individual models can be minimized by adopting a machine learning approach based on combining multiple models, but this does have limitations. The ensemble approach may misinterpret suitability if individual model predictions overestimate the species potential range. However, if occurrences from nonnative ranges were available for validating the models, this could increase the predictive power resulting in more refined predictions. Additionally, our predictions could have been improved if we adopted a hybrid approach that includes fitting the SDMs with existing ecological knowledge. Recently, development of Bayesian SDM using Gaussian process (GP) by Golding and Purse37, enables the user to incorporate prior ecological knowledge via a prior estimate of a model function. Correlative SDMs (MaxEnt and GARP) are focused primarily on the realized niche and in turn, are capable of representing only a part of the fundamental niche. Additionally, when dispersal is not included into habitat projections, potential habitat and colonizable habitat can differ significantly38. This can lead to a great deal of uncertainty when deciding on resource allocation for FIAS control measures and further lead to huge economic losses. Our approach of addressing dispersal limitations using MigClim allows simulating FIAS spread for a set of anticipated future climate change conditions while integrating species-specific genetic traits (flight capacity, long dispersal distance, etc.). We have found suitable areas where AGM is likely to spread if it gets introduced and establishes in Vancouver. Such information can be used by managers to more finely focus eradication efforts. Due to increasing trade, climate change, and a lack of established gypsy moth natural enemies, Canada’s forests are under acute risk of being invaded by AGM4,39. A recent study by Paini et al.13 found a total of 7,662 ships arriving at Canadian ports in 2005 which came to Canada directly from a port in a region where AGM is able to establish. Thus, maps produced from this study will help in providing information about the potential suitable distribution ranges of AGM for formulating effective mitigation strategies and aid in designing pest surveys and domestic quarantines. However, the maps produced should be interpreted with caution as there is no best transferable SDM for all species40 and predictions differ with varying modelling assumptions. Also, AGM infested ships could arrive to any other vulnerable port and not just Vancouver, thus additional simulations under multiple scenarios of dispersal at various points of entry are still needed. In order to meet the objectives the following steps were taken, that will be described in detail below: AGM occurrence records were collected from several sources. Spatial datasets representing current and future climate (A1B and A2) were developed alongside spatial information on the human footprint in the area of interest. Both a MaxEnt and GARP model were built to simulate the potential distribution of AGM in Asia and Canada. Dispersal limited projection of future AGM distribution under A1B and A2 climate change scenarios were produced using MigClim. Conceptual and analytical flowchart of present study is shown in Fig. 6. Flowchart representing the modelling flow used to model Asian gypsy moth distribution in this study. To compare the performances of MaxEnt and GARP and in order to map the potential distribution of AGM, we collected presence records of AGM in its native range from various sources. The sources included (1) Global Biodiversity Information Facility database, an online database for species occurrences; (2) Records provided by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA); and (3) Scientific articles and maps. We deleted duplicate records such that each observation falls inside a separate 20 km grid cell, leading to a total of 78 distinct occurrence records (Fig. 7). Our collected records cover a large proportion of the species’ native range and shows that AGM can survive under various climatic conditions (Table 1). Occurrences of Asian gypsy moth. The shaded region represents the background used for creating the SDM based on a buffered minimum convex polygon. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification (vegetation-based) system40 was used as a background. This is done to allow assessing risk based preliminary on whether a species is found in the same climate zone as the pest risk assessment area. Nineteen layers of bioclimatic data on current and future climatic conditions, A1B (moderate increase in global surface warming) and A2 (higher increase in global surface warming) were obtained from CLIMOND at 20 km spatial resolution41. Additional data on human footprint “Human Influence Index-HII” at 1 km and vegetation based Köppen-Geiger climatic zones at 20 km were obtained from SEDAC42 and CLIMOND41 respectively. The Human Influence Index (HII) is a measure of direct human influence on terrestrial ecosystems, derived from nine global variables including land cover, population density, built-up areas, roads, navigable rivers and nighttime lights43. All predictor variables were resampled to 20 km resolution using a bilinear interpolation in WGS84 projection and were clipped in ArcGIS v 10.344 to the native (Asia) and nonnative range (Canada) of AGM to allow model projections via SDM transfer. Further, these predictors were subjected to multicollinearity test using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), as the real relationship between species occurrences and environmental layers will not appear in case of heavy auto correlated variables. Therefore, we selected only one variable from each set of highly correlated variables (r > 0.7) depending on its biological relevance to the species and relative contribution to the overall model and finally selected six environmental variables: Bio1 (Annual mean temperature), Bio2 (Mean diurnal temperature range), Bio12 (Annual precipitation), Bio15 (Precipitation seasonality), HII (Human influence index) and Climatic zones for our SDM. In this study, we used two species distribution modelling algorithms, MaxEnt and GARP to map current potential distribution of AGM. These models differ both conceptually as well as statistically and are capable of accommodating complex nonlinear functions to model the relationship between species presence and predictors45. Both MaxEnt and GARP were built separately using native occurrences and were later projected onto Canada to map potential suitable areas for AGM establishment. MaxEnt is a machine learning algorithm used for describing probability distributions following the principle of maximum entropy, subject to restraints imposed by presence of species and their surrounding environment21. The entropy is defined by the following equation: where π is the unknown probability distribution; \(\hat{{\rm{\pi }}}\) is the approximation of π; X is a finite set; x is an individual element in set X; and ln is the natural logarithm. The entropy is nonnegative and is at most the natural log of the number of elements in X. GARP, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction, works in an iterative process of rule selection, evaluation, testing and incorporating or rejecting rules to produce a heterogeneous set summarizing a species ecological requirement46. These sets of rules are combined in a random way to generate the potential habitat of the species restricted by the environmental conditions47. MaxEnt software version 3.3.3 k was used to map potential distribution of AGM. Eighty percent of the occurrence data was portioned into ten random subsets and using in the k-fold cross validation function of MaxEnt. This was done to evaluate the average behavior of the model26. 10,000 pseudo-absences (PAs) were generated for model training and evaluation within an area defined by a minimum sized convex polygon encompassing occurrences in the native range using SDM toolbox48 (Fig. 7). The output predictions were based on default parameter values (0.01 convergence limit, and 1,000 maximum iterations). In order to produce simple models with smooth fitted functions we used only hinge features20. We optimized the multiplier value following an approach by Padalia et al.18. Jackknife resampling was used to identify those variables that contributed most to the model. The method provides systematic resampling and leads to improved estimates of the sample parameter and a lower sampling bias49. The mean values of relative contribution of the environmental variables were calculated from 10 MaxEnt modelling runs. The model runs were performed using cross-validation function in MaxEnt. Additionally, the fade by clamping function was used to limit extrapolations beyond the environmental range of the training data50. We used the “openModeller” software package51 to implement GARP as our second SDM. The “best subset” selection procedure was used using the new openModeller implementation with default parameters. The rule sets were projected onto environment layers of Asia and Canada to generate predictions of AGM distributions. The outputs of MaxEnt and GARP with habitat suitability values ranging from 0 (unsuitable) to 1 (optimal habitat) was recorded for both native and nonnative range. Habitat suitability for nonnative range (Canada) was further classified as very low (0–0.25), low (0.25–0.50), medium (0.50–0.75) and high (0.75–1.00) for easy interpretation and comparison purposes. The cut off threshold for species presence and absence was obtained from maximizing test sensitivity and specificity32 and was used for the suitability classification. Presence records of European gypsy moth were also overlaid on the classified map to ensure the reliability of used classification. Model evaluation was performed using the remaining 20% of the presence data for AGM in the native range. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, partial AUC ratio (pAUC), and sensitivity (fraction of correctly predicted presences) values were calculated using the above independent dataset. AUC provides a single measure of model performance independent of any particular choice of threshold. The AUC measures model performance that ranges from 0 to 1. A model performs well when the AUC is large. Usually, AUC values of >0.9 indicate high accuracy, values between 0.70 and 0.9 indicate good accuracy, and values between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate low accuracy52. In the past, authors have found the AUC test inappropriate for presence only models53 since it assigns similar weight to both commission and omission errors. Therefore we also used partial AUC (pAUC) as a second evaluation method. Here, the region of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space, where the omission error is less than the user defined variable (E), is considered for calculating partial AUC54. A pAUC value of >1.0 shows better performing model. We extracted the same number of PAs as testing presences in order to calculate the evaluation scores. PAs were extracted in the same spatial range as the presences. Partial AUC ratio and sensitivity were calculated at 0% omission rate. AUC and pAUC scores were calculated using “ROCR” R package55 and “NicheToolBox56” respectively. In order to include AGM specific dispersal constraints into projections of its potential distributions under climate change, we used MigClim57. MigClim is a function library built in R software58 that allows implementation of species dispersal limitations in SDM predictions under climate change conditions. MigClim is a cellular automaton model so cells are the measured units and here each cell corresponds to 20 km square pixel. Since MigClim does not generate habitat suitability maps itself, we used MaxEnt to generate the required inputs. Future AGM distribution maps for the year 2030 and 2050 were produced for climate change scenarios A1B and A2 using MaxEnt. These maps were used as an input along with an initial distribution map of AGM. We assumed the initial infestation point was Vancouver port since the species was able to reproduce there in the 1990’s resulting in an eradication. We chose a reclassification threshold of 0.5 along with a dispersal kernel of 1 and 0.5, since females fly on average less than 1 km (maximum range of 20–40 km). AGM long distance dispersal frequency was set to 0.1 and min-max distance range as 100 (5 cells) and 200 km (10 cells) respectively59. Propagule production potential was set to 1. We had two environmental change steps (2030 and 2050) where each environmental change step had 20 dispersal steps. Accordingly the total number of dispersal steps simulated was equal to [envChgSteps] × [dispSteps], here 40, which corresponds to 40 years from 2010 to 2050. The simulations were repeated for 10 year timeframes producing dispersal limited future distribution maps of AGM from 2010 to 2050 under A1B and A2 climate change scenarios.

The International Triathlon Union (ITU) has moved the 2020 Chengdu ITU Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event to the city of Valencia (Spain). You can find a list of other international sporting events cancelled due to the Coronavirus here. The Chengdu Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification was scheduled for May 9, with the world cup race slotted for the next day. Both events were at the tail end of the Olympic qualifying period and would have been important for athletes trying to make a last go at Olympic qualification. The Mixed Relay event will now be moved to Valencia, Spain on May 1 – it will be the “the last opportunity for three National Olympic Committees to secure two women and two men quota for the Tokyo Olympic Games,” according to a release from the ITU. “The 2020 Chengdu World Cup will be postponed until later in the season and unfortunately, due to the lack of available time in this year’s busy schedule with World Cup racing almost every weekend from March through to May, and despite every effort to find a workable solution, it will not be replaced with another World Cup within the Olympic Qualification period,” according to the release. With a number of Olympic qualifying events being postponed, the ITU says it will increase the size of some of the start fields at other events “over 65 in case it is seen necessary and technically possible.” That won’t happen at any WTS events, though. “The Asian Cup events in Tainan (TPE), Beihai (CHN) and Dexing (CHN) scheduled to be hosted in March and April have been postponed as well, with the full support of the Asian Triathlon Confederation,” according to the ITU. In addition to the Mixed Relay Qualification event, Valencia will also host a World Cup race on the weekend of May 1 to 3.

MAT will close a factory in Canada after shuttering two manufacturing units in China and Indonesia last year. Mattel, the Hot Wheels toys and Barbie dolls maker will close its Mega Bloks factory in Montreal, Canada. The factory will be shut down in 2021, but before that, the company has plans to consolidate its two manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Mattel had purchased Mega Brands for $460 million in 2014. Mega at that time was the No. 2 player in the $4 billion construction buildings sets category. In a statement Roberto Isais, the chief supply chain officer at Mattel said, “Over the past year, we have worked to transform our global supply chain which we believe is becoming a competitive advantage. We are continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint, increase the productivity of our manufacturing infrastructure and achieve efficiencies across our global supply chain.” Shutting down of the manufacturing facility located in Montreal’s St-Laurent suburb will lead to 580 job losses. The company will, however, retain the Mega corporate office, as well as the design and brand functions in Montreal, which employ nearly 230 people.  The move by Mattel is in line with other toy manufacturers, such as Hasbro Inc. HAS, which has been diversifying its manufacturing operations since 2012. Hasbro is in the process of shifting its manufacturing out of China and is exploring other opportunities in Mexico, Vietnam, and India. Mattel shares traded 0.57% lower at $14.00 in the after-hours session. On Friday, Mattel shares had closed 1.61% lower at $14.08. © 2023 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com VANCOUVER—Transit police in Metro Vancouver are asking for the public’s help in identifying a suspect who allegedly attacked a woman, punching and kicking her multiple times and pulling her hair so hard he removed a “significant” amount. But some are questioning why the incident wasn’t made more widely known sooner. The woman was sitting across from the man on a bus on April 15, and had spoken up after he verbally berated two Asian women who were wearing protective masks, officials said Tuesday. He shouted something to the effect of, “Go back to your country; that’s where it all started,” they said. That was when the female bystander spoke up to defend the two women, telling the man to leave them alone. Moments later, the suspect allegedly jumped up and kicked the victim in the leg. As the woman stood up to defend herself, he allegedly reached over and violently grabbed her hair, pulling so hard that a large clump of hair was pulled from her head. He then allegedly punched the victim numerous times in the head and wrestled her to the ground, according to transit police. “While pinned to the floor of the bus, the victim was able to fight the suspect off. The suspect left the bus and was last seen running away near Commercial Drive and East Hastings,” the statement read. The incident took place around 4:25 pm on April 15, after the man had boarded a bus at Main Street and East Hastings in Vancouver. Vancouver Coun. Pete Fry on Tuesday raised the issue of why it was only now, nearly a month later, that a request for help identifying the suspect was being made. Fry told the Star that he was disgusted to hear of racialized violence in the city. “In the interests of community safety, I think we should be hearing about these sorts of violent predatory assaults in a more timely manner, not a month after the fact.” “I appreciate the policing authorities will have their reasons for withholding information identifying alleged attackers, but I have to ask if public interest wouldn’t be better served with more proactive warnings of potentially violent, racists at large — especially when they are preying on random and vulnerable members of the public.” Since the coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan, a city in central China, waves of xenophobic and racist attacks have happened around the globe. In recent weeks, Vancouver police said, they have seen a spike in reports of anti-Asian hate-motivated incidents and crimes. Police say of the 20 anti-Asian hate crimes reported to police this year, 11 occurred in April. In comparison, police say there were 12 such crimes reported in all of 2019. Last month, the public helped police identify a suspect who assaulted an elderly Asian man with dementia in a “racially motivated attack” outside a East Vancouver convenience store. Police said the suspect shoved the man, which caused him to fall to the ground and hit his head. According to an earlier police statement, the male suspect began yelling racist insults at the 92-year-old victim, including comments about COVID-19. Police describe the suspect in the newly publicized incident as a Caucasian male, 45 to 55 years old, approximately five-foot-six, weighing 180 pounds, with a stocky build. He was wearing a red baseball hat with the letter “V” marked in the centre, a blue T-shirt, light grey sweat pants and blue shoes, and carrying a dark grey jacket with a grey backpack. Metro Vancouver Transit Police would like to speak to anyone with information about the identity of this suspect or who witnessed this incident. Members of the public can contact the Metro Vancouver Transit Police tip line at 604.516.7419 or text them at 87.77.77 and refer to file 2020-7645.

To celebrate, here's a list of 17 works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry and comics by Canadians of Asian descent. In The Library of Legends, 19-year-old Hu Lian and her classmates are ordered to flee as Japanese bombs start to land on Nanking. It's not just refugees who are in danger — Lian has been entrusted with a 500-year-old collection of myths and legends known as ""The Library of Legends."" It's now up to Lian and her classmates to protect the collection at any cost. Janie Chang is a historical fiction writer. Chang's first novel, Three Souls, was a finalist for the 2014 Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize and nominated for the 2015 International Dublin Literary Award. She published her second novel, Dragon Springs Road in 2017. A constant flow of radical updates from the government throw citizens into turmoil. At the government's department of complaints, the narrator of Familiar Face sorts through an endless pile of citizen-reported issues that range from trivial to heartbreaking. Michael DeForge is a Toronto-based creator who has won awards for comics like Leaving Richard's Valley, Dressing and Lose #1. Other acclaimed books include Stunt, Big Kids, Ant Colony, Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero and more. Samra Habib's memoir We Have Always Been Here is an exploration of the ways we disguise and minimize ourselves for the sake of survival. As a child, Habib hid her faith from Islamic extremists in Pakistan and later, as a refugee in Canada, endured racist bullying and the threat of an arranged marriage. In travelling the world and exploring art and sexuality, Habib searches for the truth of her identity. We Have Always Been Here is a contender for Canada Reads 2020, to be defended by Amanda Brugel. Heft is a conceptual look at rupture and resilience in today's world. The poems look at the nature of illness, pain and sexuality. Heft casts its lens on normal female sexual experience and the notion of home in light of chronic pain and suspected autoimmune illness on a personal level. Doyali Islam's sophomore collection was on the 2020 Griffin Poetry Prize shortlist. Islam is the editor of Arc Poetry Magazine and the author of two poetry collections. Her other poetry collection is Yusuf and the Lotus Flower. There Has to Be a Knife is about a chef who unravels after the death of his ex-girlfriend. When Omar Ali is informed his ex-girlfriend Anna has died, he resolves to retrieve her suicide note from her parents. Filled with grief and unable to cope, the 27-year-old line cook spirals out of control, participating in break-ins and online terrorism. Adnan Khan was the recipient of the 2016 RBC Taylor Prize for Emerging Writers and was a reader for the CBC Nonfiction Prize in 2017. There Has to Be a Knife is Khan's first book. This collection grapples with our understanding of depression, anxiety and mental health — topics not often explored in poetry. Pineapple Express captures the vapidity of depression and the onset of mid-life, from physical and psychological changes to eventually feeling invisible. Evelyn Lau is the author of eight poetry collections. Her memoir Runaway: Diary of a Street Kid, which recounts her time living on the streets of Vancouver, was published when she was 18 years old. She has won the Milton Acorn Award, the Pat Lowther Award and a National Magazine Award. David Ly's debut poetry collection explores the many facets of queer love. The book builds on themes of toxic masculinity, race and identity in the 21st century. Ly lives in Vancouver. His poetry has appeared in publications like The Puritan, PRISM international and The Temz Review. He read from Mythical Man as part of a cross-country digital literary event called #CanadaPerforms. Joshna Maharaj is a chef on a mission: to make the food offers at institutions — schools, hospitals, cafeterias — better, healthier, more nourishing, more sustainable and more delicious. She's been doing it for over a decade. Take Back the Tray is Maharaj's story about how she became an activist-chef, but it's also a manifesto for why we should make institutional food better and a blueprint for how we can go about making it happen. Maharaj is a chef, food expert and activist who has appeared on CBC and TVO. Take Back the Tray is her first book. Abandoning the city for the picturesque countryside, Priya and Alexandra attempt to give themselves a new lease on life in the novel Polar Vortex. That is, until Priya reveals that she is running from a fraught relationship with a friend who kept pursuing her: Prakash. After Priya feels safe enough to once again establish an online presence, Prakash communicates with her. Inexplicably, Priya asks Prakash to visit them. Shani Mootoo is a writer and visual artist who has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Her debut novel was 1997's Cereus Blooms at Night. Burning Province, Michael Prior's second collection, is set amid the wildfires that moved through British Columbia from 2015 to 2017. The poems deal with generational trauma, grief, love and inheritance, while moving between physical and psychological landscapes. Prior is writer, poet and teacher. His poems have appeared in many publications across North America and the U.K., including The Next Wave: An Anthology of 21st Century Canadian Poetry.

A Langley resident who stepped on a large hornet this month near her garden suspected it could be a “murder hornet,” — the name for the species that recently made headlines after being discovered in Washington State. She sent a picture to B.C.’s provincial apiculturist, Paul van Westendorp, who identified it as the Asian giant hornet. Van Westendorp alerted the province’s beekeeping clubs to be on the lookout for signs of the hornet, which could pose a massive threat to honey bee populations if they spread. It isn’t the first time the Asian giant hornet has been spotted in B.C. Last fall, the time when Asian giant hornets are most active, the species was seen in Nanaimo, B.C., and White Rock — an area that neighbours Langley. Langley is an outer suburb, about 45 minutes from downtown Vancouver. Local beekeepers in Nanaimo, B.C. were able to track and destroy the Asian giant hornet nest that had formed there, but experts on the species say it will only begin to be clear whether the hornets made more nests in B.C. as the summer unfolds — since they hibernate over the winter. Tim Lawrence, a county director at Washington State University’s entomology department said that as an invasive species without any natural predators, the possibility of the hornet spreading through western North America should be a concern. But his primary concern is not the hornet’s venomous sting, which can kill people and has done so in Japan — it’s the risk they pose to crops requiring pollination by honey bees. While the hornets are awake and reproducing in the spring, they’re at their most aggressive in August and September, when they hunt honey bee larvae. While Asian honey bees have natural defences against the hornet, North American honey bees are totally vulnerable. And honey bee pollination is necessary to the growth of crops such as raspberries and blueberries. Entomologists involved in tracking the hornet in western North America say they may never know exactly how it landed on this continent. Lawrence said that two Asian giant hornets found in Washington came from two different countries — Japan and Korea. “There were at least two introductions,” he said. “The reason why it’s here is really hard to say — it could have been a cargo ship.” The western state and province both have extensive shipping connections with Asia, providing potential transportation routes for the hornet — whether intentional or accidental.

Expatriates from around the world are finding Canada to be the ideal immigration destination. Because of Canada's pro-immigration stance, hard-working and experienced Asian expats from a large number of predominantly Asian countries are finding well-paid jobs in communities they can feel at home in. Asian expats are making the move to Canada for one reason, and it’s the same reason any logical person would want to immigrate to Canada for, a better quality of life. Canada’s progressive policies mean people are free to be who they want, they are free to pursue their dreams and most importantly, have unfettered freedom of choice. The Canadian government places no restrictions on people or families, and your value is determined by how hard you work, how smart you work, and the value you add to your local economy. There are pathways for businesses owners, professionals, tradesmen and semi-skilled people alike who are interested in Canadian immigration. Canada offers a high quality of living for all expats from around the world. Asian expats are raising families in cities in towns with low to negligible crime rates, incredible public services such as free healthcare and schooling, pristine air quality and inclusive communities. Canada is a melting pot of diverse cultures from all around the globe, and while pockets of cultures will form everywhere, they are constantly intermingling and doing business with each other for the benefit of their own communities and the country as a whole. Chinese and Indian residents and citizens make up the largest groups of expats in the country, followed by ex-UK residents. As a matter of fact, 20.8% of Canada’s population is made up of immigrants, the highest of the G8 countries. Opportunities for immigrants in Canada are nearly endless, it is a country where you and your family can achieve whatever you set your sights on.  There are two main immigration pathways for business owners to consider when looking into immigrating to Canada. The Provincial Nomination Program is a dedicated immigration stream for provinces to address shortages in the community. Each province has its own set of requirements for opening a business in one of their towns, cities or communities. A general outline of these requirements are: The Start-up Visa Program targets entrepreneurs who have the initiative to build a business that is innovative and will create jobs for Canadians. This visa program requires a comprehensive business plan and financial backing from a designated organization in Canada.  The Express Entry System was created with the intention of fast-tracking qualified and experienced applicants that are in-demand by Canada’s labour market. If you are a manager, professional or skilled tradesman, you may be eligible for Express Entry. Some examples of eligible occupations are: Because the majority of Asian immigrants in Canada land on the west coast of Canada, they tend to settle in provinces such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. This is one of the reasons why the Atlantic Immigration Pilot was launched, to attract more capable individuals to Canada’s easternmost provinces; Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland & Labrador and New Brunswick. This very inclusive immigration pilot makes provisions for the following categories:  With all of these immigration and visa options to choose from, the process can become quite overwhelming and confusing.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com East Asian Canadians face a disproportionate mental health impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of targeted racist attacks, violence and discrimination, a new study says. Based on random sampling, researchers surveyed 2,033 respondents online with questions ranging from demographic status to the impact of COVID-19 on workplaces, personal habits, risk perceptions and discrimination. Respondents were also asked a set of standardized questions related to their mental well-being such as if they were fearful; felt that everything they did was an effort; experienced loneliness; were bothered by things that usually don’t bother them; were restless; or had trouble keeping their mind on what they were doing. “While the current COVID-19 pandemic has had deleterious mental health impacts on all Canadians, some groups have been more vulnerable than others,” concluded the joint study by York University and the University of British Columbia, published this week by the Social Science Research Network journal. “We indeed find that during the COVID-19 pandemic, higher incidences of acute discrimination encountered by East Asian Canadians explain their higher levels of mental health symptoms as compared to white Canadians.” Since the start of the outbreak in Canada, there has been a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes across Canada. In Vancouver, there have been 29 anti-Asian attacks since the pandemic hit B.C., while during the same time period last year, there were only four similar cases. An anti-Asian racism coalition, launched in response to the pandemic, has documented 138 incidents of COVID-related racism harassment, with 110 of those reported in May alone. York sociology professor Cary Wu, the report’s lead author, said the percentage of Canadians who reported fair or poor mental health has tripled from 8 per cent before the onset of the pandemic to 24 per cent after it began. More than half of Canadians also said their mental health has worsened as a result of social distancing. After controlling for demographic factors among the respondents such as income, education and immigration status, Wu said those of East Asian backgrounds — including Chinese, Koreans and Japanese — reported poorer mental health and more discrimination during the pandemic. Respondents were asked to give a score to each question that best reflected their conditions, and the scores were used to tabulate their discrimination and depression indexes. Overall, East Asian respondents showed poorer mental health and cited more incidents of racism and perceived racism than white Canadians. The study is statistically significant with a P-value under 0.01. Wu said any increase in the respondents’ experience of and response to acute discrimination is associated with the increased mental health symptoms they reported. After controlling for acute discrimination, the East Asian-white mental health gap is no longer statistically significant, explaining the contributing factor. “Because the outbreak started in China, Chinese and Chinese-looking East Asian Canadians may have experienced more racist attacks, violence, and discrimination during the crisis than other groups,” he said. “Not only are they facing the impacts of COVID-19 but also of rising anti-Asian attacks in their everyday life.” Wu said previous studies have found East Asians are generally less likely to seek mental health services, and this report underscores the need for interventions and support designed specifically to address the needs of the East Asian Canadians in the response to the pandemic. “East Asians and immigrants were less likely than other groups to use mental health services before the pandemic, due to language and cultural barriers. During the pandemic, they actually are suffering more because of discrimination, we really need to think about how we can better design our mental health programs to address their needs.”  Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.

The proof of Canada’s ambitious approach to immigration can be seen in the fact that days before lockdown, it announced its plan to welcome more than 1 million permanent residents in the 2020 – 2022 period. Canada has processed immigration applications as best as it can all these months when it had to restrict border crossings owing to COVID-19. Until the end of April, Canada welcomed 74,000 new permanent residents. Many countries contributed to the influx of immigrants who found it best to migrate to Canada. The top 10 countries who sent migrants to Canada are: As is understandable from the list, India has been the largest source of new permanent residents in Canada. Proficiency in English is one of the important contributory factors for this dominance. Immigrants from India constituted 24% of all new permanent residents in Canada. China comes next with 10%. The Philippines have contributed 7% to this category in 2020. It is recommended that even during this COVID-19 crisis period, candidates should submit their immigration application and Express Entry profiles. It’s very likely that they will receive an invitation to apply or permanent residence and be able to move to Canada sooner. With IRCC to help immigrants in all possible ways, more people will be in a position to achieve their immigration goals.

According to a statement from the coalition, for 15 days the virtual festival will stream films and host Q&As with filmmakers, as well as other conversations on industry topics and relating to the South Asian community. The festivals that are merging their efforts are: Tasveer South Asian Film Festival in Seattle; Chicago and Washington, D.C., and Vancouver fests; Mosaic Intl. festival in Toronto; Nepal America fest in Maryland; and the South Asian Film Festival of Montreal. These festivals showcase films from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives, Tibet and Sri Lanka. The films that unspool are not mainstream Hindi films, otherwise known as Bollywood movies, but rather smaller indie movies. In a statement the Coalition of South Asian Film Festivals said it is curating cutting-edge, critically acclaimed films and making them accessible to the public for free. The films will stream on Vimeo OTT, which allows them to set up their own streaming platform. While the lineup is still being set, the films will be from those released in 2019 and 2020, according to the organizers. “CoSAFF’s efforts will provide filmmakers an opportunity to showcase their hard work to the widest possible audience in a respectful and secure manner. And, in turn, for all our audiences to have a shared experience watching these films without the burden of having to pay for them,” according to the statement.

Most Popular Content Aug 7, 2020  Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News A woman checks out a jobs advertisement sign during the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto on Wednesday, April 29, 2020. The Canadian Press/Nathan Denette Visible minorities were among those hardest hit by Canada’s recession, with some groups reporting jobless rate increases about double those of the least affected. The unemployment rate for South Asian and Chinese Canadians was 8.8 percentage points higher on average in July from a year earlier, compared with 4.4 points higher for those who weren’t designated as either a visible minority or aboriginal, according to data released for the first time on Friday by the country’s statistics agency. Black Canadians and Filipino Canadians saw an average increase of 6.3 percentage points in their jobless rate. Adding to the picture of an uneven labor market, several minority groups had significantly higher jobless rates than the majority, the data show. Around 17 per cent of South Asian, Arab and Black Canadians were unemployed in July, compared with a national average of 11.2 per cent. Among White Canadians, the unemployment rate is 9.3 per cent.  The high unemployment rates among visible minorities may be a reflection of the industries that were disproportionately hit by c-19 shutdowns. The accommodation and food services industry saw the highest proportion of jobs lost during the height of the pandemic. Within that industry, Korean, Filipino and South East Asian Canadians are most likely to be employed. The collection of race data will provide a fuller picture of how different Canadians are coping through the crisis, and be “a critical first step towards addressing inequity in our labour force,” Carla Qualtrough, minister of employment, said Friday in an emailed statement. While Statistics Canada didn’t release data for previous months, employment among immigrants is rebounding more slowly, suggesting a similar trend may be underway for visible minorities.

The coronavirus pandemic has been hard on Canadian women, who have trailed men in returning to pre-COVID-19 employment levels, in part because they are more likely to work in the face-to-face services sector. For women of color, the numbers are particularly steep. In July, the jobless rate for South Asian women aged 15 to 69 was 20.4%, while it was 20.3% for Arab women and 18.6% for black women. By comparison, the jobless rate for white women was 9.2%. Graphic https://graphics.reuters.com/gfx/rngs/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/dgkvldexovb/ ""What this pandemic has truly done is to shine a giant spotlight on all the disadvantages that were already there that we did not want to discuss,"" said Stephania Varalli, co-chief executive of Women of Influence, a networking organization for women of diverse backgrounds. Varalli said non-white women face challenges ranging from systematic racism, to being more likely to be employed in part-time or precarious work, to having less access to childcare or elder care options. ""It's a big and scary problem that will not be easy to resolve,"" she said. Canada added 418,500 jobs in July and the overall unemployment rate fell to 10.9%, StatsCan said on Friday. For both men and women aged 15 to 69, South Asians had the highest unemployment rate in July at 17.8%, followed by Arabs and Blacks at 17.3% and 16.8% respectively. Filipino Canadians, many of whom are frontline health and support workers, had the lowest jobless rate of the non-white groups at 13.2%, though their labor participation rate fell, suggesting some who lost their jobs have temporarily left the workforce. One bright spot has been female entrepreneurs, who have been versatile in adapting to changes brought on by the pandemic, Statistics Canada research shows. About 55% of businesses owned by women introduced new ways to interact with or sell to customers during the coronavirus shutdowns, while 34% modified their products, according to a StatsCan study released last month. These rates outpaced the average for all businesses. Evelyne Nyairo, a Kenyan-Canadian chemist and biologist who launched a skincare line in 2015, said COVID-19 changed her business overnight, cutting her supply chain and forcing her to lay off workers. She pivoted to making hand sanitizers in response to a Canadian government appeal. Within four weeks she had a hand sanitizer on the market and had refocused her broader product sales on end users, building direct relationships with consumers to drive repeat sales. ""People who were not our customers became our customers,"" said Nyairo, adding: ""It's challenging times. We don't know what tomorrow is going to look like, so I need to be flexible.""

We are all working incredibly hard to make sure they are safe and receiving the best education possible during this terrible pandemic. Nothing about this school year has been easy and all of us are feeling stress and anxiety. We’re worried about COVID-19 affecting our students, our families, and ourselves. Making sure our schools and classrooms are safe for our children and yours has been the top priority for us all. Now, as BC is gripped by this surging second wave of the coronavirus, we’re reaching out to you for some help. While masks are not mandatory at all times in schools, we’re hoping you can help us support a culture of mask wearing. Some schools have already taken this step. The school community has come together and made mask wearing normal and expected. It really helps everyone in our schools feel safer. We need to be doing all we can to ensure we keep each other safe. No one wants to bring COVID-19 home to their families. We know there are students and staff members who for various reasons can’t wear masks. And, there are some learning situations where masks aren’t appropriate. That’s all ok. Our school communities have a lot of experience making sure people are included and treated with kindness and respect. By talking to your children about wearing their masks in school, you can help us create that respectful culture of mask wearing. BCTF members, your children’s teachers, are committed to providing our students with supportive and enriching learning environments. We also need them to be safe. Please help make that happen. We encourage you to talk to your children and encourage them to wear masks.

"125",623,"https://new.philippineasiannewstoday.com/sports/meralco-reddy-kilowatts-bolts/","Meralco: From Reddy Kilowatts to Bolts - Philippine Asian News Today | FILIPINO Canada News Vancouver","For the fourth time since Meralco acquired its PBA franchise in 2010, the Bolts are playing in the semifinal round of the on-going Philippine Cup bubble in the hope of making it anew to the Finals of the country’s first pay-for-pay league. All media outfits covering the bubble have only been been reporting the already known facts that coach Norman Black’s Bolts were losing finalists to Barangay Ginebra San Miguel from 2017 as if to show that the Meralco franchise owned by the MVP (Manny V. Pangilinan) Group is a ‘Johnny come lately’ in big time Philippine basketball scene. It isn’t true! Records in the local basketball history show that the Meralco Athletic Club could well be the oldest existing aggrupation that has been contributing to the growth of, not only basketball but other sports as well since the Americans arrived in the country in the early 1900s. In basketball, the then known as the “Meralco Reddy Kilowatts” earned their first jewel when they crowned themselves national champions in 1932. Meralco might not have seen action yet when basketball was first played here, incidentally by women in 1911 during the Manila Carnival Athletic meet, forerunner of the now defunct Interscholastics. The sport was then called “sissy’s game.” The Meralco Athletic Club was already in the midst of things when the Manila Carnival management did away with the women’s play and introduced the game to Filipino boys few years later. Teams existing then were the Manila Sporting Goods, University of the Philippines, Manila Interscholastic Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Meralco Athletic Club became a member of MICAA when what turned out to be the country’s premier amateur commercial league opened shop in 1968. The Reddy Kilowatts, coached by their second mentor Lauro Mumar, who succeeded Tito Eduque, won the 1971 edition, beating the Baby Dalupan-mentored Crispa, 65-58 in the title playoff. The Reddy Kilowatts and the Redmanizers set the stage for the grand finale by finishing 1-2 order in the six-team elimination round field. Meralco topped the preliminary round with a clean 5-0 win-loss card, followed by Crispa, 4-1. Other teams in the cast were Mariwasa, Yco, San Miguel and Yutivo. Leading the Kilowatts’ campaign were players from the just-disbanded Ysmael Steel Admirals – Alberto “Big Boy” Reynoso, Alfonso “Boy” Marquez, Jimmy Mariano and Orlando Bauzon —reinforced by Ramon Lucindo, Robert Jaworski, Fort Acuña, Francis Arnaiz, Bobby Salonga, Arthur Herrera, Larry Mumar and Jumbo Salvador. The demise of the YCO-Ysmael Steel rivalry following the breakup of the Admirals in 1968, opened the gate for the Reddy Kilowatts -Redmanizers rivalry starting in 1970. The fierce and bitter rivalry came into full-blown during the 1971 MICAA All-Filipino championship, when Reynoso and Jaworski punched referees Eriberto “Ting” Cruz and Jose “Joe” Obias for what was the duo’s perceived questionable calls against the Kilowatts. Reynoso and Jaworski were meted lifetime suspension that was lifted two years later so the two can join the national team in the 1973 Asian Basketball Championship won by the Philippines via a clean slate. Besides the Reinforced MICAA crown, Meralco also emerged triumphantly the 1969 National Seniors and the 1970 National Invitational championships. Reynoso, Jaworski, Bauzon, Acuña and Arnaiz went on to form the nucleus of the Toyota Comets in the PBA in 1975, thus, extending their rivalry with the Redmanizers in the pro-league. Incidentally, Jaworski became the playing-coach of the Ginebra franchise in the PBA, reason why he’s been regularly attending every Gin Kings game whenever they make it to the finals. Following that sad incident and in the wake of the declaration of Martial Law in the Philippines, Meralco was disbanded only to return to big time with its acquisition of the Sta. Lucia Realty franchise in 2010. Meralco, re-Christened “Bolts” in the pro-league, debuted in the PBA during the 2010-11 season with a lineup that included Mark Cardona, Asi Taulava, Nelbert Omolon, Marlou Aquino, Beau Belga, Dennis Daa, Chris Ross, Ogie Menor, Pong Escobal and Chris Pacana.

"126",631,"https://new.philippineasiannewstoday.com/news/duterte-robredo-congratulate-biden-harris/","Duterte, Robredo congratulate Biden, Harris - Philippine Asian News Today | FILIPINO Canada News Vancouver","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo led Filipino officials in congratulating Democrat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on their election as president and vice president of the United States. Biden is poised to become the 46th president of the U.S. after gaining more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the White House. His rival, incumbent President Donald Trump, had 214 Electoral College votes as of a recent count. “The Philippines and the United States have long-standing bilateral relations and we are committed to further enhancing the relations with the United States under the Biden administration,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said on November 8. Roque said the administration is looking forward to working with Biden in a relationship “anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit, and shared commitment to democracy, freedom and the rule of law.” Robredo also extended on November 8 her congratulations to Biden and Harris. “Your victory is an affirmation of the shared ideals on which the long friendship between our two nations stand: democracy, civil rights, faith, and inclusivity. I pray for your success,” Robredo said in a post on Twitter, tagging Biden and Harris. The U.S. is one of the Philippines’ largest trade partners, export markets and sources of investment. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Philippines would have to wait and see how the Biden administration would handle certain matters like the West Philippine Sea issue. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has consistently invoked freedom of navigation in the South China Sea where its military vessels conduct visits and patrols. The U.S. has also repeatedly assured its treaty ally the Philippines that it will honor the Mutual Defense Treaty in case of external aggression. Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri congratulated not just Biden but also all Americans for “democracy in your country – a model for many countries including ours to follow.” “Biden by the way is a practicing Catholic, only the second Catholic to be elected to the White House. And who carries a (rosary) with him wherever he goes. And that is good enough for me… Peace and (healing) to our (brothers) and (sisters) in the US of A,” Zubiri said in a tweet. Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez is “well-positioned for the Biden presidency.” Recto expressed confidence that with Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. at the helm of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Romualdez in Washington, “what is good for our country in the diplomatic front will always be pursued and protected.” “Our man in Washington DC is well-positioned to help steer our country’s interest through whatever changes a Democratic White House would bring to (Philippine)-US relations,” Recto said in a statement. Sen. Francis Tolentino, who is allowed to practice law in New York, said Trump’s refusal to concede was probably because he is waiting for a Supreme Court ruling concerning mail-in ballots. “Whoever wins will take into consideration the historic bond and friendship between the US and the Philippines,” he said. Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General William Barr has authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities, if they exist, before the 2020 presidential election is certified. Trump has not conceded the election and is instead claiming that there has been a widespread, multi-state conspiracy by Democrats to skew the vote tally in Biden’s favor. Biden holds a sizable lead in multiple battleground states. In a memo to U.S. attorneys, obtained by The Associated Press, Barr wrote that investigations “may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.” He said any allegations that would “clearly not impact the outcome of a federal election” should be delayed until after those elections are certified and prosecutors should likely open so-called preliminary inquiries, which would allow investigators and prosecutors to see if there is evidence that would allow them to take further investigative measures. States have until December 8 to resolve election disputes, including recounts and court contests over the results. Members of the Electoral College meet December 14 to finalize the outcome of the November 3 presidential election. Share May 16, 2023 – After living in Canada for 35 years, Florchita Bautista is ...
