A panel of doctors at the Ahmedabad civil hospital on Wednesday, January 8, conducted the postmortem after the cops lodged a case of kidnapping, gangrape and murder against four persons. According to the report in The Hindu, the four accused had allegedly kidnapped the victim, gang-raped her before murdering her. After killing the victim, the accused hanged the body from the tree to make it look like suicide. The 19-year-old girl had gone missing on December 31, 2019, after which her family approached the police on January 3 to lodge an FIR but the local police refused. According to the report, local police inspector NL Rabri told the family that the girl was safe and had eloped with a boy of the same community and both had got married, so no case was required to be lodged. On 5 January, the victimтАЩs body was found hanging from the tree. The Family members of the victim refused to accept the body, claiming that it was a murder and not a suicide. The police registered an FIR on Tuesday тАФ against Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Satish Bharvad and Jigar in the case. The family agreed to claim the body after registration of the FIR, after which body was sent for postmortem at the Ahmedabad civil hospital. The case was registered under various provisions and sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after thousands of Dalits protested in front of the local police station.

22,Gujarat: ├втВм╦ЬMissing├втВмтДв Dalit woman found hanging from tree in Modasa,"The body of a 20-year-old Dalit woman, who reportedly went missing on January 1, was found hanging from a tree in a village of Modasa taluka in Aravalli district on Sunday. Modasa Rural police have registered a case of accidental death and investigations are under way. A family member of the deceased said that the girl, a graduate, had a beauty parlour. тАЬShe left home on January 1. After she didnтАЩt return home the next day, her father had given a complaint to Modasa Town police where he had named a suspect for the mysterious disappearance of his daughter. However, (Modasa Town) the police did not register an offence and told the father that the case falls under the jurisdiction of Modasa Rural police. On Sunday morning, the womanтАЩs body was found hanging from a tree in the neighbouring village,тАЭ said the family member. The person also alleged that the Modasa Town police did not register the case as the suspect and the police inspector are from the same community. тАЬWe donтАЩt know if she was kidnapped. But it is a fact that her body was found hanging from a tree,тАЭ the relative said. Aravalli Superintendent of Police Mayur Patil said, тАЬThe woman went missing on January 1. Her family members searched for her for two days and then gave a complaint to Modasa Town police on January 3. Following the complaint, Modasa town police recorded various statements based on which her last appearance was found in this village (where the body was found). Modasa Town police then transferred the case to Modasa Rural police. And while they were investigating the case, the girlтАЩs body was found on Sunday.тАЭ Patil said that police did not take any coercive action against the person named as suspect by the father of the woman because there was not enough evidence to do so. Inspector General of Police (Gandhinagar range under which Aravalli district falls) Mayanksinh Chavda said, тАЬWe have registered a case of accidental death. Investigations are on to ascertain various facts of the case including the cause of death.тАЭ ЁЯУг The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

75,├втВм╦ЬMaybe I├втВмтДвm Being Barred from Delhi Because I am a Dalit├втВмтДв | NewsClick,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Why did Chandrashekhar Azad, leader of the Bhim Army, go to Jama Masjid on 20 December 2019 and then again on 18 January? That he wanted to voice his disapproval of the CAA and the NRC is well known. In fact, his first action on being released from Tihar Jail a few days ago was to return to Jama Masjid and vent his anger against the CAA and the NRC, which he described as kaley kanoon or black laws. Azad does not mince words and is willing to hit out against the Modi government. Says he: тАЬThe Jama Masjid is a place of great historicity. At the time of the partition of the country, Maulana Azad had stood here and appealed to the Muslims that they should not move to Pakistan as such a move would prove inimical to their interests. Once again, there is a move by the present government to divide the country along religious lines. I come from a village. We are all aware that the CAA and NRC will cause untold sufferings to the poor while the political class will remain unaffected. It was an imperative for me to raise my voice against such a move.тАЭ But the government claims that AzadтАЩs presence at Jamia Masjid in December led to a heightening of tensions, so much so that it left several protestors injured at Delhi Gate. Azad insists such a criticism was false because when he was there last month, he had a copy of the Indian Constitution with him. He had only read out its Preamble to the enthused crowds. тАЬI did the same when I went back to Jamia Masjid,тАЭ he says. тАЬI read out the Preamble of our Constitution. It is the duty of every citizen to protect it. With the present government trying to divide the nation on the basis of religion, this amounts to nothing less than weakening our Constitution which is respected around the world and is looked upon as a unique document.тАЭ Had Ambedkar not authored the remarkable Constitution, Azad says, then Dalits such as myself and lakhs of people belonging to the oppressed communities would have continued to be subjected to humiliation on a daily basis, he says. Azad speaks with passion and that is one of the main reasons for his appeal amongst the youth. He also does not hesitate to take a snipe at prime minister Modi, which is why the BJP has little love lost for him. Now, the court has asked him to speak respectfully of Modi. Azad told me that he тАЬagrees with thatтАЭ and then he quips, тАЬShri Shri Modiji occupies a constitutional position but I would also request him to respect the Constitution instead of weakening the foundations of our country. I would not have opposed the CAA if he had included Tamils and Muslims rather than differentiating refugees on the basis of their faiths.тАЭ Azad says he emulates his hero, the revolutionary freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad. He has, of course, combined his trademark moustache with a blue scarf. He is all praise for the thousands of women who have been sitting day and night in the cold weather protesting against CAA-NRC but is unhappy over students, especially women, being beaten up in Jamia Milia Islamia and at JNU. тАЬIt is very sad....thereafter, students were beaten up in JNU, AMU, DU and other universities. I am very proud of the way hundreds of our sisters along with their children have been sitting there for over a month. But if prime minister cannot hear their voices, how will he hear the voices of crores of people living in the villages?тАЭ he says. What has really alarmed Azad is the statement of RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat on Friday that there was no question of backing out from the CAA. тАЬIt is alarming that this statement came not from the PM or the home minister but from the RSS. It just shows that the RSS is the BJP and the BJP is the RSS. We all know their agenda is to establish a Hindu Rashtra. The RSS has never accepted our Constitution and that is why they are jailing people for reading the Constitution. But opposition to these laws will not cease. We will fight and get these laws repealed even if this involves going to jail a thousand times,тАЭ he says, with bravado. Azad was jailed in 2017, in an environment of growing atrocities against the Dalits. The Dalits, at the same time, have emerged as an important vote bank. Was the present regime worried that AzadтАЩs appeal amongst the Dalits was growing. Could this be one reason why he is being jailed frequently? тАЬMaybe,тАЭ Azad says, тАЬI am being stopped from entering Delhi because I am a Dalit.тАЭ In his view, anyone who opposes the government is dubbed an anti-national, but it is the opposition parties who keep alive the spirit of democracy. тАЬThe BJP believes that the more muddied the politics of this country will become, the more the lotus will bloom,тАЭ he says. Azad also clarifies that he has no plans to enter the electoral fray at present. тАЬWe had thought of contesting elections but a decision has been postponed. Fighting the CAA-NRC is a much more crucial battle. I want to meet the protestors who have been jailed in UP. It is important to remove their fear and to build up a sense of solidarity across the country,тАЭ he says, adding, тАЬI am ready to be led by anyone who has raised the gauntlet against the government.тАЭ тАЬThere is no court bigger than the peopleтАЩs court and why should the prime minister presume that he is larger than the Constitution,тАЭ he says. Agreed, no political party is leading this protest. Rather, it is being led by the people. тАЬThe country is going through a very crucial juncture,тАЭ Azad says. тАЬIf we do not speak up now, we will not be able to go back.тАЭ  The author is a freelance journalist.

According to a report in the India Today, Rahul Gandhi was pushed to the ground by the police personnel. The Uttar Pradesh Police stopped them at the Yamuna Expressway, citing imposition of Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people.

94,3rd January in Dalit History,"Begin typing your search above and press return to search. Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize It wasnтАЩt Subhash Chandra Bose alone who turned down the Indian Civil Service. Jaipal Singh Munda did, too, and went on to become the voice of the Adivasis in the Constituent Assembly, where he spoke up against casteism and patriarchy in mainstream Indian society. A. K. Biswas looks back at his life. There are few icons of the tribal heartland who are given the importance they deserve in Indian history. They are not only segregated, but also excluded. The Tribals themselves were exploited and cheated unmercifully by the outsiders. This went on unhindered, on a savage scale, for centuries. No wonder, Tribals are suspicious of the non-Tribals тАУ their immoral motives and dark intentions. The Santhals rose in revolt in 1855. A section of society tries to project their revolt as an uprising against the British rule. But the Santhals revolt was actually directed against outsiders in general, who, in their language, were called dikus тАУ cheats, exploiters and extortionists. Birsa Munda-led rebellion or тАЬUlgulanтАЭ, meaning тАЬGreat TumultтАЭ (1899-1900), which took place in the south of Ranchi, was a landmark in the agrarian history of tribal India. It was against encroachment and dispossession of tribal land. It was a manifestation of the consequent frustration and anger among the deprived tribal communities. The Mundas traditionally enjoyed a preferential rent rate as the тАЬkhuntkattidarтАЭ or the original clearer of the forest. But during the 19th century, they had seen the тАЬkhuntkattiтАЭ land system being eroded by the тАЬjagirdarsтАЭ and тАЬthikadarsтАЭ тАУ the outsiders who arrived as merchants and moneylenders and gradually invaded their paradise in the forests. Birsa Munda was born in the Khunti subdivision of Ranchi district on 15 November 1875. He lived little less than 25 years, breathing his last on 9 June 1900 in prison. His short life left a deep imprint on the tribal communities. Jaipal Singh Munda was born three years after Birsa MundaтАЩs death. Jaipal too belonged to the Khunti subdivision of Ranchi district (Khunti is now a district carved out of Ranchi in Jharkhand). Jaipal was born on 3 January 1903 in Tapkara, a Munda village. BirsaтАЩs struggle had carved out a permanent space in history for Jaipal. JaipalтАЩs family had embraced Christianity. Missionaries of the SPG Mission, Church of England, had noticed early sparks of his talent and leadership qualities. After initial schooling in his village, Jaipal was admitted to St PaulтАЩs School, Ranchi, run by the missionaries. His amiable character and qualities enamoured all those who came in touch with him. Early in his youth, his exceptional calibre as a hockey player shone. Jaipal Singh Munda The principal of St PaulтАЩs became his patron and sent him to Oxford University, England, for higher education. Jaipal did not take much time to demonstrate his mettle as an ace hockey player in the celebrated university and was soon part of the Oxford University hockey team. The hallmarks of his game as a deep defender were his clean tackling, sensible game-play and well-directed hard hits. He was the most versatile player in the Oxford University hockey team. His contribution to the university hockey team earned him recognition and he became the first Indian student to be conferred the Oxford Blue in Hockey. At Oxford, JaipalтАЩs literary talents exploded as a prolific sports тАУ particularly hockey тАУ columnist. He regularly contributed to leading British journals and his articles were widely acclaimed by readers. In 1928, the Netherlands hosted the Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Jaipal was chosen to captain the Indian hockey team for this event. But he had a choice to make: either turn down the offer to play for India or face expulsion from the prestigious Indian Civil Service. Jaipal passed his Economics (Honours) examinations with flying colours. He then took the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examinations conducted by the British in India for bureaucracy aspirants. Those Indians who had qualified before him hailed from rich, land-owning aristocratic families. Jaipal was a striking exception. He entered the ICS with the highest marks in the interview. It was while he was undergoing training in England as a probationer that he got the call-up to represent India in the Amsterdam Summer Olympics. He was asked to travel to Amsterdam and join the team immediately. Jaipal approached the authorities at the India Office, London, seeking leave of absence so that he could proceed to Amsterdam. The India Office rejected his application outright. Indian hockey team in the 1928 Olympics after their first match versus Austria. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) He was in a dilemma тАУ whether to play for the country or hold on to the straitjacketed ICS тАУ and he picked the former. Subhash Chandra Bose has said that nobody from India had, before him, voluntarily foregone an opportunity for a career in the ICS which held in store great opportunities, social recognition, unprecedented dignity, a secure life and unquestioned authority with the British at the helm of power. Sadly, Subhash Chandra Bose had erred in overlooking this sacrifice of Jaipal Singh Munda. Jaipal responded to the dictates of his heart and defied the established conformism. He left for Amsterdam fully aware of the consequence тАУ for he stood virtually dismissed. Such indiscipline on the part of any probationer is not tolerated, much less so by the India Office at the time, which remote-controlled the Government of India from London. Indeed, such brazen defiance by a probationer was considered unbecoming of a budding ICS. The Indian hockey team for Amsterdam Olympics was announced: Jaipal Singh (Captain), Richard Allen, Dhyan Chand, Maurice Gateley, William Good-Cullen, Leslie Hammond, Feroze Khan, George Marthins, Rex Norris, Broome Pinniger (vice-captain), Michael Rocque, Frederic Seaman, Ali Shaukat and Sayed Yusuf. The league stage of the tournament involved two groups, A and B. In all, 31 players scored 69 goals in 18 matches. Of them, India (from group A) scored 29 goals тАУ Dhyan Chand scored 14; Feroze Khan and George Martins scored five each; Frederic Seaman, three; and Ali Saukat and Maurice Gateley, one each. India defeated Holland 3-0 in the final. Germany and Belgium had to be content with the third and fourth positions, respectively. Jaipal did not play the final against Holland. Serious differences had cropped up between team manager A.B. Rossier and the captain. Jaipal had gracefully opted out of the final match. Vice-Captain Broome Pinniger stewarded the team to a convincing victory over Holland. This was IndiaтАЩs first ever Olympics gold. Jaipal returned to England after the 1928 Olympics. Then Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, personally congratulated him for his excellent captaincy and the teamтАЩs performance and victory. The India Office appeared to have softened their stance on the ICS. Perhaps prodded by Irwin, Jaipal was asked to rejoin the ICS probation, which, however, was extended by a year. He felt humiliated by the decision to extend his probation. He found it discriminatory and unacceptable and consciously defied the orders of the India Office a second time. He returned to India and joined a multinational oil major, Burmah Shell, which had offered him the position of a senior executive while he was still in England. In metropolitan Calcutta, where he was based, Jaipal met his future wife, Tara Winfred Majumdar. She was the granddaughter of Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee, one of the founders of the Indian National Congress and its first president (1885). Their marriage, however, did not last long. Teaching assignments took Jaipal to different places тАУ from Raipur (the present capital of Chhattisgarh) in the Central Provinces and Berar, to the Gold Coast in Ghana, Africa, and finally, to Rajputana. In Raipur, he became the principal of Rajkumar College. Here, he became the target of caste hatred and discrimination, despite his outstanding educational qualifications; accomplishments, including those in sports; competence; and leadership qualities. Rajkumar College was the exclusive preserve and grooming ground of young men from Indian princely and feudal families in the company of European students. The parents found it unpalatable and galling to have their children educated under a Tribal. The Europeans too were uncomfortable. So, Jaipal proceeded to the Gold Coast, Africa, again on a teaching assignment. Gradually, his career changed tracks. When he returned to India, he was appointed Colonization Minister and Revenue Commissioner in the princely state of Bikaner. This stint, in which he was unimpeachable, earned him further laurels. He was elevated to the post of Foreign Secretary of the state of Bikaner. Jaipal Singh Munda sketch (Source: Adivasi Resurgence) At this stage, he felt a profound urge to do something for his people, the neglected and exploited tribal communities in Chota Nagpur in Bihar. He returned to Bihar and met Dr Rajendra Prasad, president of the Bihar Provincial Congress Committee, at Sadaquat Ashram in Patna. There, he felt, he was accorded a cold reception. If one door closes before a determined person, with his belief in himself and strength, another opens up simultaneously. The proverbial door opened for Jaipal, too. The Governor of Bihar and Orissa, Sir Maurice Hallet, who requested him to become a member of the Bihar & Orissa Legislative Council, opened the door. He, however, politely declined the gracious offer. Then, both the Governor and Robert Russell, the chief secretary, advised him to take up the cause of the tribal people who were already in a restive mood. Jaipal Singh went to Ranchi, where Tribals gave him a warm and tumultuous welcome. In 1946, Jaipal was elected to the Constituent Assembly from a general constituency in Bihar. The 296-member Constituent Assembly was tasked with drafting the Constitution. Jaipal spoke for the first time in the Assembly on 19 December 1946. Introducing himself as a тАЬjungliтАЭ тАУ a forest dweller тАУ he spoke of the тАЬunknown hordes тАУ of unrecognized warriors of freedom, the original people of India who have variously been known as backward tribes, primitive tribes, criminal tribes and everything else. Sir, I am proud to be a jungli тАУ that is the name by which we are known in my part of the country.тАЭ Speaking for the people living in the Chota Nagpur plateau, he supported the resolution that articulated the aspiration and sentiments of тАЬmore than 30 millions of the AdibasisтАЭ (amid cheers), because it was also тАЬa resolution which gives expression to sentiments that throb in every heart in this countryтАЭтАж He added, тАЬAs a jungli, as an Adibasi, my common sense tells me, the common sense of my people tells me, that every one of us should march in that road of freedom and fight together.тАЭ At the time, the newly independent country was brimming with emotion and idealism. However, about seven decades on, we have a deep sense of disillusionment. A tragedy has befallen the country and the masses have become the collective victims of a section of greedy, manipulative and unprincipled leaders who are intrinsically entrenched and involved in unbridled loot, unchecked corruption and blatant exploitation for Jaipal Singh Munda captained this Indian hockey team that won the Gold in the 1928 Olympics held in Amsterdam, Holland self-aggrandizement.  Jaipal Singh did not mince words to ventilate the grievances of his тАЬprimitive peopleтАЭ who, according to him, were тАЬshabbily treated тАж They have been disgracefully treated, neglected for the last 6,000 years.тАЭ When and how did it began? Who were the men guilty of disgracing and neglecting the tribal people? Jaipal Singh Munda told the assembly: тАЬThe history of the Indus Valley Civilization, a child of which I am, shows quite clearly that it is the newcomers тАУ most of you here are intruders as far as I am concerned тАУ it is the newcomers who have driven away my people from the Indus Valley to the jungle.тАЭ This was the severest indictment possible of the тАЬhonourable menтАЭ comprising the newly elected Constituent Assembly. They were extremely accomplished men and women, elected from all parts of the country. If the historians have not placed this statement in Indian historiography, it only indicates their failure. It underlines that they had no courage to do so, and deep bias and prejudice dominated their writing and re-writing of history. Jaipal was telling his peers about the invasion that led to the damage and destruction of the Indus Valley, which boasted of a glorious civilization. He said that the people living in the Indus Valley were driven to remote, inhospitable forests and mountains. Indeed, to declare it among the honourable members of the Constituent Assembly that they were guilty of this relentless brutality was tantamount to their public condemnation. The miserable fate of his people led him to bemoan that, тАЬthe whole history of my people is one of continuous exploitation and dispossession by the non-aboriginals of India punctuated by rebellions and disorderтАЭ. It may be stated that 292 members of the Constituent Assembly were elected through the provincial legislative assemblies; besides, there were 93 members who represented the Indian princely states, and four members who represented the Chief CommissionersтАЩ Provinces. They sat in silence and listened to Jaipal as he waxed eloquent on an alternate history of India. Some of them included mass leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, C. Rajagopalachari, Sarojini Naidu, J.B. Kripalani and Dr Sachchidanand Sinha. The maharajas of Patiala, Bikaner and Gwalior and the Nawab of Bhopal, too, heard his speech with rapt attention. The apathy and negligence of the Cabinet Mission with respect to the tribal people of India came up for sharp criticism in his speech. тАЬHave we not been casually treated by the Cabinet Mission [and have not] more than 30 million people [been] completely ignored?тАЭ Representing these 30 million, he bemoaned, there are only тАЬsix tribal members in this Constituent AssemblyтАЭ. Jaipal noted that the tribal communities are a living example of an egalitarian society. He said, тАЬThere is no question of caste in my society. We are all equal.тАЭ Their unabated exploitation, he said, exhibited the dominant paradigm of the social-economic and political culture. He strongly demanded the inclusion of тАЬmore AdibasisтАЭ in the national legislature to represent their interests. A firm believer in gender equality among the tribal communities, he said, тАЬI mean, sir, not only (Adibasi) men but women also. There are too many men in the Constituent Assembly. We want more women тАжтАЭ Jaipal Singh was definitely one of the first to press for the participation of women in shaping and building independent India. In a stirring speech, Jaipal Singh told the Constituent Assembly, тАЬYou cannot teach democracy to the tribal people; you have to learn democratic ways from them. They are the most democratic people on earth.тАЭ This country should be proud of the tradition of democracy prevalent and practised by the tribal communities тАУ free from inequality, discrimination and disadvantages imposed on one section by another without any reason and logic. тАЬWhat my people require, sir, is not adequate safeguards тАж they require protection from the ministers. That is the position today. We do not ask for any special protection. We want to be treated like every other Indian,тАЭ he said. On the issue of freedom and rights under Article 13 (1) (b), namely, to тАЬassemble peaceably and without armsтАЭ, he pointed out тАЬthat this matter of the Arms Act has been very mischievously applied against the Adibasis. Certain political parties have gone to extremes to point out that because Adibasis carry bows and arrows, lathis or axes, which they do daily as a normal part of their life, which they have done for generations and generations, and what they are doing today they have done before, that they are preparing for trouble.тАЭ He cited the example of the Oraon tribe. тАЬWe have in this Assembly only one Oraon member. Now, the Oraon group of Adibasis constitutes the fourth largest block of Adibasis in India.тАЭ Jaipal Singh highlighted the cultural traditions of the Oraons. тАЬThey have, what we call, тАШjatrasтАЩ or тАШmelasтАЩ. These are annual occasions for their cultural activities. They have a certain ceremony in which the head of the Oraon village will carry the flag and the rest of them will carry lathis with them and proceed into the various тАШakhadasтАЩ or villages. It is a festival for the people; they have done it in a harmless way for generations and generations, and, now we have been told last year and the year before last, that we should not carry weapons. I do not mind pointing out there are several members here from Bihar who will never be able to get back to their homes unless they are escorted with people and with arms. In my own part, we live in the jungles and everyone, even women, may I point out, carry what might be designated arms, but they are not arms in that sense. Whenever we have to hold meetings, if people come with their own usual things, I want to know whether it is going to be interpreted that we are assembling non-peacefully and carrying arms for an unlawful purpose. These are the only points, sir, that I want to be clarified. тАЬI will give one more instance. Every seven years, it is the custom in Chota Nagpur to have what they call тАШEra SendraтАЩ тАУ тАШJanishikarтАЩ. Every seven years, the women dress as men and hunt in the jungles тАУ dressed as men, mind you. That is the occasion, when, naturally, women like to show masculine prowess. They arm themselves like men with bows and arrows, lathis, bhelas and so forth. Now, sir, according to this particular Article in the Constitution, the government might interpret that women, every seven years, have been getting together for a dangerous purpose. I urge the House to do nothing that is going to upset the simple folk. They have been among the most peaceful citizens in our country and we should be very very cautious in doing anything which might be misunderstood by them and lead to trouble.тАЭ Jaipal Singh added: тАЬI have been traversing a lot among the Adibasis in the Adibasi tracts, and, in the last 9 years, I have traversed 1,14,000 miles, and it has given me an idea of what the Adibasis need and what this House is expected to do for them. He urged that the interests and cultural traits of Tribals needed protection and care.тАЭ Jaipal thus was a man of many parts тАУ an accomplished writer, a hockey wizard, an excellent orator, a visionary, an uncommon patriot and an indefatigable champion of the Adivasi cause. Jaipal stands out among current and past sports personalities with his integrity, patriotism and courage тАУ qualities that would propel him towards becoming Marang Gomke, the great leader of the tribal people.

A+| A| A- Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde, Gurugram: Penguin Random House India, 2019; pp 325, тВ╣ 599. While you may dismiss Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde as another rant on caste, it sizzles and draws the line with a renewed focus on Brahminism as the ideology that governs IndiaтАЩs public life, the core weaknesses of the Dalit movement, and the kind of radical action caste-embedded marginality calls for. The work builds on the experiences of the author as a DalitтАФfrom an urban fringe in Nanded, Maharashtra to a young academic at Harvard Kennedy SchoolтАФhis encounters with people drawn from diverse backgrounds in several countries, and the kind of reactions that caste invoked in them. Calling attention to the тАЬhuman degradationтАЭ that caste subscribes to, its тАЬviolent and toxic ethos,тАЭ тАЬdeep hatred of the other,тАЭ the kind of terror it unleashes on тАЬlesserтАЭ and тАЬdefamed bodies,тАЭ its тАЬbrutal chronicles from the pastтАЭ and the тАЬcontinuing experiences of humiliation and stigma in the present,тАЭ the study intends to set up a public conversation on caste. Critical of the тАЬDalit hope of a constitutional state,тАЭ it seeks to catalyse тАЬa new idiom for transformation.тАЭ It challenges the beguiling slogans of development and welfarism and argues that the priority should be тАЬto end and annihilate the echo chamber of oppressionтАЭ (p 33). He thinks that Dalits have their тАЬHarlem momentтАЭ today, in the wake of new technologies of communication and expressions of freedom. A specific methodology informs the text throughout: The author sets aside complex processes of adducing evidence, while backing his observations and judgments through illustrations. It does enable him to reach out to a wider public. Troubles of Dalit Movement The book highlights the continuing dominance of the upper castes, the mote lok, in the Indian body polity, and the persisting marginality and subhuman treatment meted out to Dalits: While the economic system of feudalism has been gradually replaced with a mixed modern-day model of capitalism and state socialism, the social aspect of feudalism is as entrenched as ever. (p 27) The constitutional frame has limited reach to the oppressed, but тАЬmany Dalits are repeating the stateтАЩs narrative of constitutionalism as being the ultimate virtueтАЭ (p 76). In the face of social sanction, law remains a mute witness. The constitutional mask placed on B R Ambedkar lets the state to play identity politics, scuttling Dalit radicalism. Schemes, such as reservation, have led to fights for crumbs. The political regime in place asks Dalits to prove their patriotic credentials, while denouncing their struggles for their rights. Dalits often speak of organisational unity, but are split into umpteen groups beholden to self-serving leaders. There are the тАЬToken DalitsтАЭ who consider themselves integral to Hindu culture and sell themselves to the highest bidder. It includes тАЬConservative DalitsтАЭ who diligently practise the caste chores passed on to them as untouchables and тАЬReactive DalitsтАЭ who have no convictions of their own and make their presence felt by reacting to the position of others. There are the тАЬElite DalitsтАЭ consisting of salaried hypocrites, and third generation Dalits. While the salaried Dalits shun fellow Dalits and imitate their non-Dalit peers, the third generation Dalits are тАЬclass-sensitive and caste-blind.тАЭ The millennials among the latter are technologically savvy and end up тАЬemulating Hindu practices in their households.тАЭ There are the тАЬSelf-obsessed DalitsтАЭ who use the social capital of the community, but having succeeded, use Brahminical language to denigrate their community members. They are harmful as they claim to speak for Dalits. In all, тАЬprivileged Dalits effectively execute caste codes upon the lower social, economic and political sub caste Dalit groupsтАЭ (p 98). There is also a lack of social endosmosis among Dalit castes. It all helps the Brahminical ideology to thrive. Brahminical order weighs heavy on Dalit females as тАЬcaste, religion, patriarchy, class and spatialityтАЭ overlap in their marginality. The critical sections are the тАЬRadical Dalits,тАЭ found in any class or sub-caste of Dalits, who are proud of their caste and Dalitness and are committed to their struggle. They make offences against Dalits public, challenge Brahminical discourse, and reach out to all oppressed persons. The book points out that Dalit intellectuals run an entire spectrum of thinking today: Caste radicals, pragmatic Dalits, Ambedkarites and Marxists. While a spiritual canon is constructed with Ambedkar as the centre, Dalit spiritual life continues to be extremely diverse. Even those who have embraced Buddhism after Ambedkar read it in different ways. There is clearly a process of nationalisation of Dalits to subserve the interests of neo-liberalism in India. The author refers to the much talked about phenomenon of Dalit capitalism patronised by the state and institutionalised in the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There is a parallel for the same in the initiative of Booker T Washington who set up capitalist enterprises for Blacks in the United States. The author, however, feels that such an initiative is not compatible with the marginality of Dalits in India, their considered views on the question, and the social nature of capital in India. Dalit capitalism is a new mode of тАЬBaniaising,тАЭ inserting Dalits into the existing structures rather than transforming them. The vision of Ambedkar is akin to that of W E B Dubois, who insisted on political power, civil equality and higher education, and did not privilege capitalism. The author also feels that the left has mastered its plan of blaming Western imperial order as the central problem тАЬwhile remaining blind to the local, everyday caste oppressionsтАЭ carried out тАЬwithin the new capitalist market.тАЭ Dalits qua Dalits have no agency when they are listed by the left in the struggle against oppression. Brahmins and Brahminism The author thinks that although many atrocities on Dalits might be committed by the Shudras and Kshatriyas, it is the Brahmins who control and regulate the normative order manifested in the тАЬorganised power of religionтАЭ (p 290). It is the Brahminical order which assigns places and ranks within the social order. Brahmins have absolute control over spiritualityтАФtemples, rituals and wealth amassed through тАЬgodly guilt.тАЭ They enjoy monopoly over soft power, such as the media, and there is little representation there for Dalits or their concerns. Casteism or the ideology they sustain is the тАЬlongest-thriving pathologyтАЭ of conjuring differences between human beings that affects the тАЬmental and social healthтАЭ of the nation as a whole. A child is reared in emphasising differences and otherness. But, at the same time, тАЬan a-caste, тАЬnormal,тАЭ and тАЬneutralтАЭ identity dominates mainstream discourseтАФwhich is actually a thinly-veiled ideal of Brahmin identity that everyone is supposed to aspire to. Inevitably, amidst this narrative, it is the Dalit who is forced to feel the burden of being тАЬdifferent.тАЭ This makes Dalits to strive тАЬto be someone apart from a Dalit.тАЭ (p 288) тАЬThe Dalit lives in the miasma of Brahminical devaluation. The differences are markers of hatred, pain and sufferingтАЭ (p 289). While liberal Brahmins often lament Brahmin orthodoxy, they do not attack the тАЬcaste system in its entirety.тАЭ Therefore, there is a thin line between Brahmins and Brahminism. The author feels that тАЬblindfolding when it comes to privilegeтАЭ (p 245) is widespread in India. It is the Dalits and lower castes who are projected as corrupt, while large-scale looting of public money is done by the upper castes. Landed castes, as neo-Kshatriyas, are in the race too to loot public wealth. There were several Brahmins who were close companions of Phule and Ambedkar in their call to social revolution, and their sacrifices, courage and humanity deserve admiration. But, they tended to distance themselves when Ambedkar made the caste question primary. In IndiaтАЩs caste-setting, there is an urgent need of тАЬcultural suicide-bomber Brahmins who are willing to self-immolate and blow themselves up culturallyтАЭ (p 291). The Idea of the Dalit Self What is it that has made Dalits to survive against all odds, when barricades are drawn against them and they are тАЬpoliced since childhood, their actions being disciplined through the caste codesтАЭ? It lies in their тАЬinnate capacity to cultivate self-love in the bareness of apathy and tragedyтАЭ and тАЬthe audacity to hope while locked in darkness.тАЭ It lies тАЬin the resolution of the community to adhere to the principle of loveтАЭ (p 46) from which arises the principle of compassion. It is the courage to love in the face of oppression that forms their bridgehead to humanity. It is this attribute that nurtures a disposition of non-violence. The community privileges reason too. тАЬIt values the best of others and acknowledges the worst in others as a human fallibilityтАЭ (p 56). Brahminical culture does not accord recognition to Dalit endowments, leave alone achievements. Dalits are the тАЬcarriers of alternative traditions of counterculturesтАЭ that are repositories of тАЬsubtle modes of survival.тАЭ Humour is the most valued human expression in Dalit circles. Dalit language too is an expression of the art of resistance and survival. It harbours a spirit of universalism, common humanity, and maitri or fellowship. Striving to тАЬa horizontal order where no one is downgraded to sub-humanityтАЭ is common across Dalits. To global struggles, they hold forth the experience of тАЬtheir ability to thriveтАЭ amidst adversity. An Alternative Imaginary The author feels that Dalits seek a тАЬsystem of radical democratic governance operated by Dalits and non-Dalits of a liberal-radical bentтАЭ (p 89). тАЬDalit radicalism and Dalit dissentтАЭ would be an important resource for the same. Such a striving would tap тАЬthe glorious past and historical connection of Dalits to their ancestral chordтАЭ and AmbedkarтАЩs radical legacy and his colossal scholarship that sought a тАЬclass-based solution for all castesтАЭ (p 83). While the middle class harbours within it contradictory tendencies, and as a sociological concept is susceptible to diverse readings, it would be a false image of Dalit middle class if we equate it with the тАЬsalaried wage-negotiating class which mostly works in the service industry or public sectorтАЭ (p 163). From the 1990s, there is a new Dalit middle class in the offing. This class тАЬis largely urbane, aware, conscious and ready to fight, and is committed to their conviction for the communityтАЭ (p 164). This class possesses the social capital to stand on an equal footing with the rest. They have led movements, floated a large number of bodies, unions, organisations, political parties and offered ideological guidance. тАЬThey have matured the critical theory of Dalit liberation and made it publicly accessible for the general massтАЭ (p 167). They promote тАЬprogressive values,тАЭ тАЬdefy the regressive backwardismтАЭ imposed on them by тАЬcaste ecologyтАЭ and question тАЬthe legitimacy of the state led by the dominant caste minorityтАЭ (p 175). Dalits are committed to a nationalism that upholds тАЬrespect for everyone,тАЭ тАЬdignity and justiceтАЭ that each person owes to another, centres around Dalit lives, and redraws human boundaries. While there is an absence of hatred in it, it is ever-ready to retort the privilege blind. Dalits do not seek merely emancipation, that is, reforms and change of attitudes within structures which keep their agency stunted, but liberation, that is, to make themselves the тАЬgoverning class,тАЭ set up their own agenda, and privilege their own experiences. It factors in the oppression grounded on gender, religion, race and sexuality as integral to Dalit concerns. Distortions and Loud Claims If concern and the advocacy that ensues from it is the case, then you have much to take home in this book; if it is scholarship, then much of what the author says has already been said by others. There are category problems: caste and untouchable/Dalit while they share some things in common, are also very different realities. The untouchable is at the bottom of the caste, but they are also outside the system, and consequently weighed down by all the dung-heap that everyone else throws at them. The author largely focuses on the latter, but by simply encompassing them within the frame of caste, the book sheds little light on the kind of alignments that are required. While untouchability is a hydra-headed evil, its most stark reality is still in the countryside where humiliation and violence are imminent. Dalit women bear this brunt much more than others, and there are few sanctions against such onslaught. While such crude practices of untouchability are still extant in IndiaтАЩs urban landscape, and even in the diaspora, they are much more nuanced. Just because they are nuanced, they are not less effective, but untouchability practices in much of IndiaтАЩs countryside are a class apart in barbarity. The author does not pay any serious attention to this distinction. The practice of untouchability, and the kind of resources and opportunities that Dalits can access to are very uneven in India. The internal cleavages within Dalits can exacerbate this unevenness much further. The Maharashtra-focused experience that informs the book does not pay much heed to this unevenness. While Ambedkar remains the towering exemplar across this unevenness, this appeal remains too varied. The author does not show adequate attention to the wider cultural embeddedness of Dalits, a cultural resource that is increasingly co-opted by the Sangh Parivar today. The author does not seem to be very aware that Dalit communities all over India have held on to their folklore and cultural assertions. These resources form the bridgeheads to connect them to non-untouchable lower castes.  EPW looks forward to your comments. Please note that comments are moderated as per our comments policy.

Times of IndiaтАЩs Edit Page team comprises senior journalists with wide-ranging interests who debate and opine on the news and issues of the day. Politics is a lot about seizing the moment and Dalit neta Chandrashekhar Azad may have done just that when he showed up last month at the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi. Over 25 days in jail may have ensued but the optics of Azad at Jama Masjid, holding aloft a copy of the Constitution with BR AmbedkarтАЩs face adorning the cover, will endure for some time. In one stroke, Azad received the national attention he was seeking and projected himself as a votary of a Dalit-Muslim socio-political alliance. BSP supremo Mayawati has reason to worry after an unchallenged run as the countryтАЩs tallest Dalit neta since her mentor Kanshi RamтАЩs passing. Younger Dalits are not enthused by her aloofness and defeats in successive elections. AzadтАЩs Bhim Army rose to prominence during the 2017 Saharanpur riots when Dalits clashed violently with Thakurs, just months after BSPтАЩs rout and BJPтАЩs ascendance in the UP assembly polls. Arrested and detained for over a year under the draconian National Security Act, Azad has since toned down his rhetoric in an obvious attempt to widen his appeal. But can a Dalit-Muslim alliance take hold? Muslims in AzadтАЩs home state UP are split between SP, BSP and Congress. They made common cause with the Yadavs under the influence of Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav but ties are weakening now amid reverse consolidation by other groups. Actually Azad cannot even take Dalit support for granted. But his chutzpah marks him out. The present movement, like the anti-Emergency struggle, offers opportunities to new politicians to emerge. So the incongruity of the stiff bail terms keeping Azad out of Delhi until the assembly election sticks out. Disparate parties that sense the promise of this young politician would be happy that he is being kept away from the тАШactionтАЩ, for now.  {{C_D}} {{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

109,"19-year-old found hanging from tree: Gujarat DGP transfers Dalit woman├втВмтДвs ├втВм╦Ьrape, murder├втВмтДв case to CID","Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) has set up a Special Investigation team (SIT) and tra-nsferred the investigations into the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman to Criminal Investigation Department (CID) тАУ Crime. DGP Shivanand Jha also suspended police inspector NK Rabari who was accused of delaying the registration of complaint by the womanтАЩs relatives when she went missing. He was transferred from Modasa town police station to Isari police station in the district on January 12. The three-member SIT headed by DIG Gautam Parmar will also probe allegations against the police officers of derailing the probe and delaying the registration of the complaint. The womanтАЩs body was found hanging from a tree on January 5, within days after she went missing. Family of the deceased alleged that the woman was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered by four accused persons, of which three have been arrested. The fourth accused is still on the run. All the four have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act. The FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by a family member of the woman. In the FIR, the complainant alleged that town police inspector Rabari did not act on a complaint that the woman went missing on January 3. The FIR states that Rabari had told the family that their daughter had married a man of her community and that Rabari would produce her along with a marriage certificate. However, on January 5, her body was found hanging from a tree in a village of Modasa. Police registered an FIR in the case against four men after Dalits from the region had protested in big numbers outside Modasa Rural police station. ЁЯУг The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

110,"Dalit Pichda Ek Saman, Hindu Ho Ya Musalman | Velivada","Begin typing your search above and press return to search. Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize The endemic nature of quotidian caste atrocity and episodic inter-religious communal violence, and especially its effect on women, has historically assumed an air of eerie obviousness in the popular imagination in India. Yet the phrase тАЬrising intoleranceтАЭ employed in recent discussions indicates a dramatic escalation of various manifestations of violence, especially since the right-wing BJP captured power in 2014. The murders of rationalists, the lynching of Dalits and Muslims on the pretext of saving the cow, the crackdown on dissenting student voices from marginalized sections or radical political traditions and the general culture of fear generated in the public sphere are unprecedented. How does one account for this contemporary rage and violence? I would tentatively engage with this question by advancing two lines of argument. First, in India the тАЬsocialтАЭ, configured primarily in terms of caste, is the key storehouse of power. One may locate the contemporary rage and intolerance in the dislocations within the social due to the sedimentation of neo-liberal and democratic discourses. Second, there is rising intolerance across faith traditions. Since caste is not merely a Hindu phenomenon but constitutes the specific South Asian sociality that cuts across faiths269, the ruptures in the social affect all religious collectivities. While the competitive nature of inter-religious violence or communalism, which often foregrounds тАЬmajority-minorityтАЭ or тАЬHindutva-IslamismтАЭ duopolies, is often the object of most enquiries, I would suggest that one also needs to retrieve the symbiotic and co-constitutive nature of contending communalisms as restorative attempts to preserve the de facto law of caste by elites across religions.- I Caste in South Asia has been a key mode of exclusion that has hitherto governed the distribution of power and resources. Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the foremost anti-caste theoretician and leader, termed the caste system Brahmanism and articulated it as a system of graded inequality that entailed тАЬa gradation of castes forming an ascending scale of reverence and a descending scale of contempt.тАЭ It is a system of ranked differences where the four major status groups or varnasтАФBrahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants), Shudras (labourers/artisans)тАФare hierarchically arranged in terms of purity and pollution, with Brahmins being considered ritually the purest. There is also a fifth group of avarnas/panchamas/atishudra, now popularly recognized as Dalits, which comprise the formerly untouchables and are technically outside the fourfold caste order. Adding to the complexity of social stratification, each of these broad normative categories is further differentiated internally into endogamous and hereditary occupational groups termed jatis. In practice, jatis are probably the more functional and easily identifiable units, even when their textual hierarchy is often complicated, subverted and redefined daily in the political. As an enduring effect of orientalist discourse, caste has been usually framed as a Hindu phenomenon but empirically it has organized social life in all religious traditionsтАФincluding Islam and ChristianityтАФin India. For instance, among Muslims three kinds of status groups can be identified: One, those who trace their origin to foreign lands and the converts from Hindu higher castes (ashraf); two, the converts from clean occupational castes (ajlaf); and three, the converts from the formerly untouchable (Dalit) castes (arzal). Moreover, the Ashraf constitute the highest stratum within this structure. Their position and rank within the Muslim caste system is almost identical with that which the Brahman and Kshatriya grouped together are granted in the Hindu caste hierarchy. Thus, both the Sayyad and Shaikh, as competent religious pedagogues and priests, are almost identical with the Brahman; whereas both the Mughal and Pathan, being famous for their chivalry, appear to be equal to the Kshatriya. In recent decades, the Pasmanda movement, organized by the lower-caste Muslims in order to challenge upper-caste hegemony within Indian Islam, tries to address this gap. The Pasmanda discourse has foregrounded the complicity of upper-caste Muslim elites in sustaining and reproducing communal discourse that is often instrumental in legitimizing episodes of communal violence. In fact, there is a stress on the dialectical relationship between majority and minority communalisms and the Pasmanda movement proposes to contest minoritarian fundamentalism from within in order to wage a decisive battle against majoritarian fundamentalism at the national level. Ali Anwar, the leader of the movement, opines thus: We see that the politics of communalism, fuelled by both Hindu and Muslim elites, is aimed at dividing us, making us fight among ourselves, so that the elites continue to rule over us as they have been doing for centuries. This is why weтАжhave been seeking to steer our people from emotional politics to politics centred on issues of survival and daily existence and social justice, and for this we have been working with non-Muslim Dalit and Backward Caste movements and groups to struggle jointly for our rights and to oppose the politics of communalism fuelled by Hindu and Muslim тАШupperтАЩ caste elites.

114,"From Khairlanji to Hathras, Rape Story Repeats Itself for Dalit Women | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS The visceral screams of fear and pain, the sense of utter powerlessness, the dread of ominous threats coming true, the sheer brutalityтАФall of it must have been the same for the 19-year-old who was violated in Boolgarhi village in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh as for 17-year-old Priyanka Bhotmange and her mother Surekha in Khairlanji village, Maharashtra. The two incidents of alleged gang rape and murder of dalit women are separated by 14 long years, during which IndiaтАЩs collective conscience and sensitivity to such crimes was supposedly sharpened by the Nirbhaya case, but the arc of safety and security does not bend any more towards womenтАФespecially dalit womenтАФnow than it did in 2006. On the contrary, crimes against dalit women, especially assault and rape, have increased manifold. After the Bhotmange womenтАЩs mutilated bodies were fished out of a canal in Khairlanji, Bhandara district in Maharashtra, along with violated bodies of PriyankaтАЩs two teenage brothers, on September 29, 2006, it took public outrage, mainly by dalit organisations, for the then Maharashtra government to crank up action. The outrage also stirred Mumbai and DelhiтАЩs media towards covering the horror that had unfolded that evening. In these respects too, not much changed in the past 14 years. MaharashtraтАЩs then Home Minister had expressed doubts that the victims may have been Maoists. In the Hathras case, Uttar Pradesh officials were crass. They initially denied the incident, then called it тАЬfake newsтАЭ, and displayed their most impervious side, making the brutalised 19-year-old lie on a bench under the blazing sun, sending her only to a local hospital despite grievous injuries, taking her to Delhi only after she turned critical, according to her family. If this was not enough, they burned her body after locking up her family in their home in the middle of the night and admonishing them тАЬaap se bhi kuch galatiyan hui haiтАЭ. Dalit women live with little dignity, it seems they must die without dignity too. From Khairlanji to Hathras lie lakhs of storiesтАФmany of them corpsesтАФof brutalised women, especially dalit and tribal women, all of whom bore the brunt of toxic masculinity along with gender or caste supremacy on their bodies. From 2006 to 2019, the total number of rapes reported is over 4,00,000; a substantial number of the reported rapesтАФsome estimates say one in every fourтАФis on dalit women. For every rape reported, several go unreported. And this reporting does not include marital rapes. The National Crime Records Bureau data shows the total number of rapes reported in 2006 was a shade less than 20,000; 10 years later, it was closer to 40,000. Occasionally, a particularly brutal case might catch the nationтАЩs attention. NirbhayaтАЩs plight shook the nation in December 2012, the outrage turned public opinion against the incumbent Congress-led governments in Delhi and the Centre. It led to changes in the criminal law on rape and solemn pledges of тАЬno more NirbhayasтАЭ, a fund was set up, and the case exploited by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 general election. The rise in total rape numbers every year since then was cited as evidence of more women reporting the crime. It might be partly true. The sustained coverage of the Nirbhaya case might have chipped away some of the stigma around reporting rape, but it also established that as many women were being raped. The total number clocking well above 32,000-33,000 every yearтАФ2016 was the worst in the past seven yearsтАФmeant nearly 90 women raped every day. The large majority are statistics, a few are remembered like the little girl in a Kathua temple, the 12-year-old in Chennai raped over seven months, the Kerala nuns, the Unnao case in which the victim was set ablaze near a court, the young woman in Uttar Pradesh who saw her family wiped out after raising her voice against BJPтАЩs MLA Kuldip Sengar and the young veterinarian in Hyderabad. However, to read the rape story only through numbers would be to skim the surface of the horror women face every day. Parse the numbers and the relationship between caste and rape, or any crime against women, is inescapable. Overlay this with state-wise data and it is evident that dalit women in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where toxic masculinity meets caste bigotries, face the worst of sexual crimes. These states consistently rank high for crimes against women, especially rapes, and of dalit women. The perpetrators, almost without exception, are men of upper castes. Crimes against dalits increased by 6% between 2009 and 2018, according to the National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) report this year. тАЬDalit women often bear the brunt of violence at the hand of dominant caste; violence as grave as physical violence, sexual violence and witch branding. In the Covid-19 pandemic also, Dalit women witnessed various forms of atrocitiesтАж In the last five years, 41,867 cases or 20.40% were related to violence against Scheduled Caste women,тАЭ the report said. The NCRB confirms the trend of crimes against dalits. It registered surges in such crimes every year between 2013 and 2018. Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against dalits, at 25.6% of all cases reported. In 2017, the agency published data for cases specifically and exclusively registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. There were 5,775 cases; 55% of them related to тАЬintentional insult or intimidation with intent to humiliateтАЭ dalits, other cases pertained to occupation of dalitsтАЩ land, preventing dalits from using public places and social boycott. In Boolgarhi-Hathras, the victimтАЩs family was among the few dalit families in the village and had a running dispute over land with their upper casteтАФThakurтАФneighbour, according to her brother who spoke to the media. His grandfather had lost his fingers while trying to save himself during an attack some years ago, he added, detailing how shop-keepers sprinkle water on the money they handed out or how they are not allowed to touch merchandise in a shop. To ignore the context of caste and see it merely as a sexual crime would be meaningless. The young woman, as activists and scholars have pointed out, was assaulted, violated and tortured by the Thakur men to send out a message: stay within your status, donтАЩt mess with us. In Khairlanji, the story was similar. The Bhotmanges was among the handful of dalit houses in the village dominated by OBC-Kunbi caste. Most of the local chatter about why the family was heinously attacked and killed centred on the fact that they owned and tilled five acres, Surekha managed the land affairs herself, and was making sure that her children studied well. She had also stood witness for a Khairlanji policeman in an altercation he had had with some villagers. Together, it was seen as an affront by the upper caste men. The family was not allowed to build a pucca house, Surekha was тАЬa mere Dalit woman was thumbing at usтАЭ as an accused villager had told this writer. Surekha was not only raped, she was stripped and paraded around the village, then sexually assaulted by a large group of men such that her skull was broken and an eye was disgorged. Her daughter too was paraded naked, raped, and foreign objects were found in her private parts. Her brothers too suffered similar assaults. These were caste atrocities beyond a shadow of doubt. тАЬThe entire village was involved, I was in my farm and then I hid behind a bush,тАЭ said Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange, SurekhaтАЩs husband. Local cops were suspended and the case investigated by the CBI. The fast-track trial court held eight people guilty of murder and handed out death penalty to six of them. In 2010, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court heard appeals and commuted the death sentence to 25 years imprisonment; it also termed the murders as тАЬrevenge killingsтАЭ and held that the murders were not pre-meditated or motivated by caste prejudices. The SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was ignoredтАФand a justification was found for this too. Equally shocking was that the guilty were absolved of rape charges. The delay in registering cases and conducting medical examinations, unwillingness of the local police to prevent erasure of evidence, lackadaisical prosecution were all responsible. The judgement makes a reference to how PriyankaтАЩs body bore injury marks all over and that the accused disrobed her тАЬto get satisfaction to their sexual eyesтАЭ but the court held the women were not raped. Bhotmange got some compensation and lived elsewhere, he used to go to his house every September 29, to light a lamp. He died three years ago. The appeals are pending in the Supreme Court. In the Hathras case too, the police reportedly prevented the family from even seeing the victim one last time, held back all villagers, and most insensitively burned her body in the dead of the night. The national outrage ensured that the accused were arrested. But no one is sure that the medical evidence collected will prove the charges of rape in the fast-track court that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath set up under pressure. A savarna (upper caste) group already banded together to express support for the accused but the Chief Minister waited out two weeksтАФand for a nudge from the Prime MinisterтАФbefore even setting up a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. Even as this was announced, the equally heinous Balrampur case came to lightтАФagain a young dalit woman, breaking boundaries to get educated, raped and murdered allegedly by two Muslim men. Crimes against dalitsтАФand tribalsтАФincluding rape does not happen out of the blue. It often begins with age-old discriminations, each case of insult to and assault of dalits over months and years on land or water or access to public spaces creates an atmosphere in which dalits can be attackedтАФwith impunity. The atmosphere when such seemingly minor cases go unrecorded or unpunished is that upper castes can get away because the administration is тАЬon our sideтАЭ. Small sections of national or local media have recorded minor crimes against dalits in the past few months; a journalist took note of nearly 18 rapes or gang-rapes in two days after the Hathras incident. These sustained and heinous crimes are a message, according to dalit scholar and professor Anand Teltumbde, now accused of Maoist links and imprisoned. Atrocities against dalits have тАЬa unique mix of sadism and bestialityтАЭ, he and S Anand wrote, 10 years after the Khairlanji shocker, atrocities are тАЬa mode of teaching a lesson to the entire Dalit communityтАЭ. Teltumbde spoke of how Khairlanji dispelled many myths, including that economic development does away with casteism or that dalits in political or administrative power can orient the administration to do justice for the community. The few dalit MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh legislature have been unmoved so far about the insults or atrocities. The Assembly from 2017 comprises nearly 45% upper caste MLAs, up 12% from the previous Assembly. Ministers in Narendra ModiтАЩs cabinet who made political capital out of the Nirbhaya case, even Modi himself, have said little by way of consolation or condemnation of the incidents. Former Union Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and the incumbent, Smriti Irani, were elected from Uttar Pradesh but the vocal women have not said a word. There is no getting away from the fact that the BJP is heavily weighted in favour of upper castesтАФbrahmins, thakurs and baniasтАФin its election strategies and political capital, never mind the talk about тАЬsabka saathтАЭ. In his analytical book, тАШKhairlanji: A Strange and Bitter CropтАЭ, Teltumbde detailed why such cases of extreme brutality on dalits, especially women, are not тАЬisolated eventsтАЭ or тАЬjust misdeeds of some uncultured barbaric monstersтАЭ. Violence against dalits, especially rape, is a functional and systematic way of enforcing social order which is why it is тАЬperformed as a public spectacle by collectivesтАжrape is not a private affair, it becomes a celebratory spectacle. Atrocities involve intricate and devious planning so that they become a тАШlessonтАЩ for the entire Dalit communityтАЭ, he wrote. This is why knee-jerk reactions such as тАЬhang the rapistsтАЭ cries that gathered momentum over Hathras, hanging the rapists of Nirbhaya, killing the accused in police encounters as in Hyderabad do not address the core issue of continuing and escalating attacks on dalits. These actions merely satisfy the revenge motive in an outraged public without in any way addressing the underlying caste issues. That is why, in his book, Teltumbde cautioned, тАЬEvery village in India is a potential KhairlanjiтАЭ. The author is a senior Mumbai-based journalist and columnist who writes on politics, cities, media and gender. The views are personal.",1,1,1,3
117,Cong-BJP Fight as MP Dalit Man Set Ablaze by 4 Battles for Life,"Dhanprasad Ahirwar was doused in kerosene and set on fire by his neighbours. The Congress and the BJP in Madhya Pradesh hit out at each other after a 24-year-old Dalit man was set ablaze in Sagar district on Tuesday, 14 January. Dhanprasad Ahirwar was doused in kerosene and set on fire by his neighbours Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan, and is battling for life in Bhopal's Hamidia Hospital with over 70 percent burns, Motinagar police station in charge Sangita Singh said on Saturday, 18 January. Ahirwar had filed a police complaint over a dispute and the accused were forcing him to take it back, Singh said, adding that Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan had been arrested. Leader of Opposition in the MP Assembly Gopal Bhargava visited Ahirwar in Hamidia Hospital and claimed crimes against Dalits were increasing under the Kamal Nath government. State BJP president Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had told police three times that his life was in danger but he got no help from the authorities. He said police did not act on Ahirwar's apprehensions because of the Congress-led government's vote-bank politics and policy of appeasement. The MP Congress, meanwhile, hit out at the BJP and said it was giving a communal colour to every issue. """"The BJP needs to change its perception of seeing communal politics in every issue. This is a criminal case and the police have arrested the accused immediately,"""" MP Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said. (This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed.

118,"3 Sentenced To Death By Telangana Court For Rape, Murder Of Dalit Woman","The court found the three guilty of all charges A special court in Telangana on Thursday sentenced three men to death for raping and murdering a Dalit woman last year. The court has also imposed a total fine of Rs 26,000 on them. The body of the 30-year-old woman was found with her throat slit and stab marks on 25 November, 2019, a day after the offence. The woman used to sell balloons for a living. Three men were arrested on November 27 and charged under relevant sections of the Indan Penal Code for gang rape and murder besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Additional Public Prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. The court found them guilty under all the sections and awarded the death penalty. The three accused had earlier pleaded not guilty. Expressing happiness over the verdict, the woman's husband said """"We are happy. Justice has been meted out and we request the court that they should be hanged immediately."""" The Telangana government had last month issued orders, designating the Fifth Additional Sessions Court as the special court for speedy trial in the case. On December 14, 2019, a charge sheet was filed and the trial commenced on December 23. Arguments were completed on January 20 and the case was subsequently posted for judgment. As many 25 witnesses were produced by the prosecution that had been demanding capital punishment on the lines of death penalty awarded to the accused in the Nirbhaya gang rape murder case in Delhi.  Earlier in December, the woman's family and different organisations had staged protests and demanded an """"encounter"""" death for the three men like the four accused in the Hyderabad veterinarian's gang rape and murder case. The four accused in the veterinarian case were killed in an alleged exchange of fire with police on the outskirts of Hyderabad on December 6, 2019.

130,"Netizens Take To Twitter After 19 Yo Girl Dalit Girl, Gang Raped, Murdered, Found Hanging From A Tre","NEWS Bhavya Mehta On 5th January a body of a 19-year-old Dalit woman was found hanging from a banyan tree in Saira Village, Gujarat. According to the postmortem reports, she was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered before her body was found hanging by the tree. According to a report in The Hindu, the accused hanged the body of the victim from the tree to make it look like a suicide. The victim had gone missing on 31st December. According to The National Herald, the family approached the local police to file an FIR on 3rd January but the police refused. Inspector NL Rabri, told the family that the girl had eloped with a boy from the same community and insisted that she was 'safe'. The family refused to claim the body until an FIR was filed, they believed that the accused was murdered. It was only on Tuesday, two days after the body was found that the police officially registered an FIR against four men, Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvard, Satish Bharvard and Jigar in this case. Gandhinagar Range Inspector, General Mayansilh Chavda further added: With an aim to spread awareness and bring justice to the victim, netizens have taken to Twitter using a trending hashtag: *Images of tweets are sourced directly from Twitter . The hashtag has been blurred to conceal the identity of the victim.*",1,1,1,3
134,"Weeks After Rape and Murder of Dalit Woman, Modasa Case Still Shrouded in Mystery","A police inspector was suspended for alleged inaction, while the first post-mortem report did not consider other wounds the 19-year-old sustained. The woman's father sits next to a framed photo of her. Photo: Sukanya Shantha Sayara village, Modasa: The beaming face of a 19- year old woman shines out of a tall, white flex- board hoisted right at the entrance of the Dalit basti in Sayara village of Modasa Taluka. Villagers stop by for a moment or two with their folded hands and read the description printed on the board. The board offers homage to a teenager who was allegedly abducted, gang-raped and brutally murdered on January 5. They hurriedly walk away when inquired about the incident. No one wants to talk about the horrid incident. On January 5, the body of the young woman was found hanging on a long-standing banyan tree, bang at the entrance of the village. The teenager, a second-year commerce student, the sixth of the seven siblings, had left home on January 1 to register herself for an advanced computer course. She never returned. Three weeks since her death and two different investigations later, it has now emerged that the victim was brutally sodomized, dragged and then forcibly hanged from the tree, according to an Ahemdabad Mirror report. Four men, all in their early 20s, have been accused in the case. Also Read: Gujarat Village Erupts in Protests After 19-Year-Old Dalit Woman Gang-Raped and Hanged After the victim went missing on January 1, the family says they waited for two days for her to return. тАЬWhen she didnтАЩt, we went to the Modasa town police station on the early morning of January 3,тАЭ her distraught mother says. At the police station, the family claims, police inspector N.K. Rabari asked them to not worry and told the family that the victim had married someone within their caste. тАЬHe spoke to us as if he had definitive information about her whereabouts. He even told us that he would soon produce my daughter with her marriage certificate,тАЭ the father, a farm labourer shared. Rabari has since been suspended from work and the recently formed Special Investigations Team (SIT), led by deputy inspector general (DIG) Gautam Parmar is also probing RabariтАЩs probable link with the accused persons. The victimтАЩs elder sister, a 21-year-old beautician, is key to the investigation. She had allegedly seen the victim being abducted from a village bus stop on January 1 around 1 pm. In her statement, she has named four men тАУ Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Jigar and Satish Bharvad тАУ of forcibly taking her away in a four-wheeler, now identified as a Hyundai i20, keeping her confined for four days, raping her and then hanging her from the tree. While the first three surrendered before the police, Satish Bharvad is absconding. All accused belong to the Rabari caste, a pastoral community classified as an Other Backward Classes (OBC) in Gujarat. Although the community is largely economically and socially backward, the victimтАЩs relatives say Bimal BharvadтАЩs family, particularly, is landed and has political clout. From the start, the investigation did not inspire the familyтАЩs trust. The victimтАЩs mother says, they had waited for four days for their daughter to return. The police failed to act and then on January 5, the body was finally found hanging. тАЬUnderneath the tree, a small temple of Kodialmata has been built. On January 5, when the priest went to pray, he looked up and found the body hanging. He raised an alarm and we were soon informed,тАЭ the mother says. тАЬOnly if the police had acted upon our complaint swiftly, our daughter could have been saved, perhaps,тАЭ she adds. The family used to live in a hut built on their small patch of land, but has since moved to a relativeтАЩs house in Sayara village. The Wire tried to find the priest who found the body for his version of the story. Most villagers claimed they did not know him and dissuaded this reporter from probing further. One person, however, said the priest belonged to the Panchal community and the land adjoining the Banyan tree belonged to the priest. Once the body was found hanging, the family and Dalit rights activists from several parts of Gujarat had gathered in the village and demanded the police arrest the accused immediately. The family refused to let the body be taken for autopsy until the FIR was registered. The FIR has several sections of the Indian Penal Code for abduction, gangrape, and murder. Sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been slapped on the accused. The Wire visited the spot where the body was found hanging. Although it was made to look like the young student took her own life, the body was knotted to a blue cloth at a height of around 20 feet, which is unlikely for a person of frail built to scale. The victim, according to the post mortem report, was only 152 centimetres tall and petite. The spot where the body was found hanging. Photo: Sukanya Shantha Discrepancies in the investigation Questions have been raised not just about the policeтАЩs refusal to act upon the complaint immediately but also in the way the investigations were carried out. For instance, the first interpretation of the post mortem report drawn soon after the body was recovered suggests there werenтАЩt any injury marks on her genitalia. The report, however, suggested injuries were sustained to her neck. The report mentioned that тАЬpart of rectum is prolapsed out from anal canalтАЭ, but this crucial information was not taken into consideration. The second post mortem, provided by a panel of five forensic scientists, has indicated that the victim was sodomized repeatedly. The second report also points to four different injuries on the body of the victim. Besides the injury on her neck, the woman sustained тАЬabraded contusionsтАЭ to her forearm, abrasion on her upper chest towards the left side, and on her left arm. These abrasions, the report has suggested could have been sustained during a struggle or when being dragged on a hard surface. Until now, only the family had claimed that she was sexually assaulted. This report has substantiated the familyтАЩs claims. A senior police officer, however, has claimed that the forensic report received after the analysis of the victimтАЩs body doesnтАЩt show the presence of any тАЬforeign particlesтАЭ. тАЬNo saliva, hair or semen was found on her body. This, however, doesnтАЩt mean that the victim was not sexually assaulted. They could have used precaution at the time of the assault.тАЭ He added that the forensic report on her clothes is awaited. Family members went to the home of one of the accused The statements given by the victimтАЩs sister have also shifted substantially. Strangely, the family had not named the accused until the womanтАЩs body was found on January 5. This, even when the victimтАЩs sister says she saw the men drag the woman into a car, argue with her before zipping past her. According to the sisterтАЩs statement recorded in the FIR on January 5, soon after the victim was abducted, the family along with several men from the community, visited the spot where she was abduted. They retrieved CCTV footage from a nearby establishment, identified the car and its car number and then visited prime accused Bimal BharvadтАЩs house. Here, the sister claims, the family urged BimalтАЩs father Bharatbhai Bharvad to return their child back to them. A couple of days after, at the time of a protest meet arranged in the village, the victimтАЩs sister in a video recording again repeated her statement as given to the police. Here, however, she mentioned that she was with the victim from 9 am to 1 pm. She is also seen identifying the men by their names and their respective villages. Also Read: Most Crimes Against Dalits Are Against SC Women: NCRB Data When The Wire and Shantaben Senma, a social worker from Gujarat-based Dalit rights organisation Navsarjan Trust, met the family on January 19, the family repeated their statement. However, they claimed that the men were unknown to them. They refused to name any of them and denied having met the family of one of the accused while looking for the victim. The victimтАЩs sister has been unwell since the past week and the SIT, after several attempts, questioned her only on January 22. Modasa village in Gujarat. Photo: Google Maps тАЬMy child was my prideтАЭ Among seven siblings тАУ six daughters and a son тАУ the victim was the only one who had continued to pursue her education. The parents say despite the familyтАЩs difficulties, she had insisted on completing her studies. тАЬWe could not afford to educate them, so my other children had to drop out of school. She was studious, so we sent her to her auntтАЩs place in Isari at a very young age,тАЭ the mother shares. тАЬMy child was my pride,тАЭ the father adds. The family is only one of four that belong to the Chamar community, a Scheduled Caste, in the village. The village predominantly comprises of Patel, Thakor, Darbar, Rabari and Panchal houses. There are also a few dozen houses of the Vankar community, another Scheduled Caste. Social segregation is palpable in the village, with the Dalit basti built separately at a corner, away from the houses of the dominant castes. The victimтАЩs family, like other Dalits in the village, survives on frugal means, depending on a very small patch of land. The victim was their hope for a better future. тАЬThey snatched our only hope from us,тАЭ the father says.",1,3,1,3
141,Violence targeted at Dalit and Muslim students,"| A visually impaired student who was attacked by the masked goons at the Sabarmati Hostel in JNU on January 6. Photo: R.V. Moorthy June 7, 2005: ABVP students trying to disrupt the meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education called to discuss the National Curriculum Framework of School Education at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. Photo: The Hindu archives ABVP supporters march in support of the new citizenship law in Ahmedabed on December 18. Photo: Ajit Solanki/AP Shortly after masked assailants, allegedly belonging to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), created havoc on the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in New Delhi on January 5, mauling students, ransacking hostels, and brandishing iron rods, the picture of a visually impaired student, who was one of those targeted, emerged on social media. Surya Prakash, a student pursuing MPhil in Sanskrit, was allegedly targeted because a picture of Dr B.R. Ambedkar was seen on the door of his room. If Surya Prakash was attacked because he was a Dalit and identified himself with Ambedkar, Pervez and Mumtaz, pursuing courses in Persian, were targeted because of their religion. For Kashmiri Muslim students it was a double whammy; they were Muslim and also Kashmiri. That was reason enough to attack them, ransack their rooms, and break the doors and windows of their rooms. The rampage drove the students away. A day after the attack, many of the rooms belonging to Muslim and Dalit students were found locked. As admitted by one of the ABVP functionaries on television, the violence was targeted. Besides Dalits and Muslims, the goons focussed their energies on Left-leaning students and those belonging to the studentsтАЩ union. Rooms belonging to students with ideological affiliation to the ABVP were not touched. The attackers, it seemed, were keen to carry forward the casteist and communal agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) according to which a Muslim is the perpetual тАЬotherтАЭ, the Dalit is supposed to exist only at the sufferance of the twice born, and Left parties are an anathema to the idea of a Hindu Rashtra. The ABVP takes a lot of pride in its association with the RSS. Always keen to dispel the impression that it is the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ABVP, founded in 1948, makes it clear that it is the student wing of the RSS. Says the noted JNU historian Aditya Mukherjee: тАЬThey assert themselves as a wing of the RSS. They are very conscious about it, very clear. They draw their inspiration from their parent body. Their tactics have always been about muzzling and browbeating, not civil discourse. It is always about provocation. After all, they are a wing of the RSS.тАЭ Prof. Rizwan Qaiser, who teaches history at Jamia Millia Islamia (this Central university campus was also witness to violence as part of the protests against the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019) concurs with these views. тАЬThey will never show it on paper, but they are very much associated with the BJP. In terms of ideology and cadre support, however, they are dependent on the RSS. Many people will recall how they came to the fore during Anna HazareтАЩs [anti-corruption] agitation in 2011. The protest held at the Ramlila ground in Delhi, ranging from the crowd to banners, to the food, to even the Anna Hazare caps the protesters wore, were all funded by the RSS. And ABVP members acted as the organisationтАЩs foot soldiers during the entire movement. They were everywhere. So much so that to the common man it seemed as if the Anna Hazare movement was a movement of IndiaтАЩs youth against the government.тАЭ Qaiser draws an interesting parallel between the RSS and the ABVP. тАЬThe real agenda of the ABVP for the past many decades has been to project themselves as nationalists or hyper-nationalists, just as BJP leaders seek to do today. The rest of the people are not nationalists, they are compromised. It is the same ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha used to follow in the pre-1947 period claiming that they were true nationalists and the Congress stood compromised. The ABVP has been doing it for years now. For them, if you are not with them, you stand compromised. Clearly, there is not much difference between the ABVP and the RSS. Whosoever is in ABVP today is likely to be in RSS some day, if not now.тАЭ Ajay Gudavarthy, Associate Professor in the Centre for Political Studies, JNU, expressed similar views. Gudavarthy, who has some ABVP members among his students, says, тАЬThey have links with the RSS. A lot of ABVP students have direct contact with the RSS. There is a pracharak who keeps guiding them on how to act at a particular time. They get their instructions from him. They meet him every fortnight. There is a complete hierarchy. But I do feel the ABVP members are at times just pushed into something. For instance, in JNU, they were in agreement with their students that the Vice Chancellor should be removed and the fee hike should be rolled back. But the RSS dissuaded them. The RSS targets JNU through the ABVP for ideological reasons. The very presence of the university makes them feel inferior. They provoke, but do not know how to resolve the issue. Some of my students who are ABVP members tell me that they raise questions with the RSS pracharak. In the fee rise case, too, they asked how the organisation can be popular on the campus when 60 per cent of the students cannot afford the new fee structure. But the RSS wants to change the character of the university by changing the fee structure so that the poor do not enter it. Many of the poor people today, however, are part of the RSS. The RSS guys do not know how to address this anomaly. When they do not know how to resolve a thing, they take to violence and criminality, as seen recently. I have never seen the ABVP engaged in dialogue, debate, discussion. They are usually combative. Some of it stems from their background. Many of them come from the landlord background since the colonial, even pre-colonial times. For decades, upper castes have joined the ABVP. Now, the Other Backward Classes [OBC] masculinity has also joined them.тАЭ Hence, the violence inflicted on Muslim and Dalit students in JNU. Gudavarthy says: тАЬThe ABVPтАЩs anti-Muslim narrative, like that of the parent body, is a compulsive narrative. With an alternative movement gaining ground across the country, they have to create an enemy, hatch some conspiracy. Their politics caters to only the elite social structure. To camouflage it, they have to target Muslims. The Muslim card is a compulsion. They employ the Muslim narrative in a contextual manner. Same is the case of Dalit politics. It stems from a pathological mindset, the upper-caste dominant narrative unable to cope with the changing social narrative. They cannot digest diversity and plurality. It challenges their very being. Women in public space irritate them. Different languages in public space irritate them. Muslims, Dalits, anybody who is not like them irritate them.тАЭ Talking of JNU, the ABVP has never had a strong presence on the campus. Prof. Mukherjee says, тАЬUntil 10 years ago, they had no influence in JNU. It has not changed much now either. They have had to import goons for violence.тАЭ According to Prof. Qaiser, тАЬthe ABVP never had a formal presence on the campus. When I studied there in the 1970s and 1980s, there was no mention of the ABVP. Many people of that ideology were there informally, but joined other bodies. Much later one discovered, тАШoh, he turned out to be from the ABVPтАЩ. They were never encouraged in the past. Now they enjoy a free run. Fortunately, there are not many takers for that ideology on the campus today also.тАЭ Yet, there is one crucial difference. Over the years, the ABVP has transformed itself from being a marginal presence to a central one. In the past, the body sought legitimacy through association with others; today it seeks to confer legitimacy on many a young, aspirational student, giving them hope of becoming a Central Minister, like Arun Jaitley, the late Finance Minister in Prime Minister Narendra ModiтАЩs Cabinet. Qaiser says: тАЬThe ABVP would ride piggyback on any movement in the past. They populated the Jayaprakash Narayan movement in the 1970s and attained legitimacy. Now, they are unleashing a horse on their own. In 1975, they were like fringe elements. Now, they call the shots. They draw inspiration from the top. They are just running amok.тАЭ After the Emergency, the ABVP came into limelight towards the end of the 1980s during the anti-Mandal agitation. тАЬThey were opposed to Mandal. Their opposition, however, was not based on principles of equity or equality of opportunity for all, but on a casteist agenda of keeping a section down. They were, like the RSS, carrying forward the Manuvad agenda,тАЭ says Prof. Mukherjee. Incidentally, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ABVP was not the only body affiliated to the RSS to gain legitimacy. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad gained prominence and Bajrang Dal members gained popularity by sending the BJP leader L.K. Advani a cup of their blood as he set out on his rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya. As Dhirendra Jha writes in Shadow Armies: Fringe Organizations and Foot Soldiers of Hindutva, they тАЬalso welcomed him by applying tilak of blood on his foreheadтАж. After the BJP formed a government in Uttar Pradesh in 1991, it was the Bajrang Dal which directly participated in skirmishes on the Ayodhya issue while the prominent constituents of the Sangh ParivarтАФthe RSS, the BJP and even the VHPтАФshunned any public posturing. This was a well-considered strategy where an affiliate organisation lower down the hierarchy was deployed to keep an issue alive for future exploitation while the more important fronts remained relatively quiet to prevent any embarrassment for the BJP government.тАЭ The Bajrang DalтАЩs strategy of the 1980s and the early 1990s is being practised by the ABVP today. Even as the ABVP cadre unleashed violence on the JNU campus, and about a year earlier in September 2019 in Jadavpur University, where, too, ABVP volunteers committed arson at the university gate and ransacked rooms, besides indulging in violence in Delhi University, Bengaluru and elsewhere, the RSS stayed mum, and the BJP government at the Centre maintained a studied silence. All this is part of the time-tested strategy, seen and experienced in the past. The ABVP, like the Bajrang Dal, drinks from the fount of the RSS.",0,0,1,3

The fight for Dalit rights has taken a louder voice now more than ever before. We all know of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar as being the pioneer of the Dalit movement in India and there are people who have carried his legacy through. Thus, Dalits have found their place in society through politics and activism which has gone a long way in bringing the Dalit voice to the forefront.

200,International study centre better than tallest statue for Dalit icon: VBA chief Prakash Ambedkar,"Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar Tuesday reiterated his reservations to the proposed statue for Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar and suggested that an international study centre dedicated to the architect of the Indian Constitution would be a better tribute. The Dalit leaderтАЩs comments come days after he suggested the Bombay High Court asked the state government to utilise funds sanctioned for the proposed statue of his grandfather at Indu Mill in Mumbai for improvement of the cash-strapped Wadia hospitals for women and children instead. тАЬThe greatness of B R Ambedkar cannot be measured with the height of a statue. It is a futile exercise undertaken by successive governments to serve their politics,тАЭ Prakash Ambedkar told The Indian Express. On January 15, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had approved a proposal to raise the height of the proposed statue for Ambedkar by 100 feet and cleared the revised expenditure of Rs 1089.95 crore from Rs 750 crore for it. The VBA chief said, тАЬI have conveyed my reservation to the present plan for the memorial with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. I have also offered to discuss with them my original concept, which was evolved way back in 1998-99 when the NDA government was at the Centre.тАЭ He added then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given his consent for an Ambedkar International Study Centre, but could never be translated into reality as mainstream political parties, including BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP, were keen on a memorial and a statue. тАЬWhat is the purpose of having another statue of Ambedkar in Mumbai? At the most, it will be taller than the ones already existing at Chembur and Vidhan Bhawan. And political parties will just take the credit for the same and use it for their vote bank in successive electionsтАж Let us not reduce the proposed Ambedkar memorial to a picnic spot or tourism centre,тАЭ the Dalit leader said while pressing for a world-class study centre.

214,The Position of Dalit Women in Indian Society,"The caste system is an ancient societal classification of people based on their varna (caste order or class) or jati (birth). An apartheid-like system, IndiaтАЩs caste order is the archetype of the closed system of social mobility and a structure rigged towards oppression regardless. This orthodox classification once determined a personтАЩs occupation, marriage practices, and the privileges one enjoyed. In the varna system, extensively discussed in the Dharma Shastras, Dalits were positioned beneath the caste order itself, in a group that was casteless, тАШuntouchableтАЩ and alienated. Women who belonged to the four primary Hindu castes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) are called Savarnas (notice that it is spelled with an uppercase тАШSтАЩ always to indicate superiority) while Dalits and scheduled tribes who did not belong to any caste are called avarnas. The word тАШDalitтАЩ literally means тАШbrokenтАЩ or тАШscatteredтАЩ in Sanskrit. In the 1930s, the word meant тАШdepressed classтАЩ in Marathi and Hindi. The caste system was not always as oppressive as it has been after a few culturally sanctioned laws like from scriptures like the Manusmriti, Vishnu Smriti, and the Atharva Vedas post-2500 B.C. Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in his article titled тАЬThe Rise and Fall of The Hindu Woman,тАЭ pointed out that the root cause of suffering in India was on account of religious scriptures that sanctioned this oppression. For instance, women at large had no right to education, independence, and wealth. This threw Dalit women unarmed and vulnerable against a rigorous patriarchal system. The Manusmriti regards the killing of Dalit women lightly, their lives were a perpetual cycle of humiliation and abuse. And like Dalit woman activist Moni Rani Das, puts it тАЬIf you are not considered human, human rights do not apply to you.тАЭ Systemic crimes In the case of Payal Tadvi, discrimination was very subtle and sophisticated. As a student of medicine, she reported that the professors would not assign her cases to practice her profession, she was not allowed inside the operation theatre and was given a lot of menial jobs to do until the day she decided she had had enough. It was Tuesday the 28th of May last year when she took her life. The incident has whipped up considerable debate and the suicide has been regarded as a тАШState-sponsored crime.тАЩ Institutional casteism begins as soon as the student steps into the school or college through a reservation method. Dalit girls in schools are made to sweep and clean classrooms and corridors and in some anonymous reports, even clean septic tanks. According to the National Commission for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes 2000, about 75% of Dalit girls drop out of primary school despite laws that hold тАШprogressive reservationsтАЩ for Dalit children. Their academic aptitude is usually despised and one of the reasons for their early drop out is an escape from bullying, humiliation, and isolation by classmates, society, teachers, and management. Low literacy is also on account of the lack of educational resources, privatization of schools and colleges, severe poverty, and the demand for an increased dowry for educated girls. Violence More explicit violence has also been the order of the day. Violence is used as a powerful political tool for oppression and the assertion of power. Ruth Manorama, an active member of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights and the National Alliance of Women, once stated that in a male-dominated society, тАЬDalit women face a triple burden of caste, class, and gender.тАЭ Bindu, a 27-year-old Dalit girl from small-town India had refused to take an offer from the son of the town leader. It was 50 rupees (less than $ 1) in return for sex. Her house was set on fire and the familyтАЩs belongings were thrown down the local river. Another 19-year-old named Chanchal was asleep when four men from a dominant caste attacked her and poured acid on her face. Her crime: she was trying to pursue an education. Her face remains severely marred and she reported, тАЬneither the police nor the government seems serious in pushing my case.тАЭ A large number of crimes against Dalit women in modern India go unreported because they are not тАШimportant enoughтАЩ. тАЬ[Dalits] are often victims of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights violations, including sexual abuse and violence. They are often displaced; pushed into forced and/or bonded labour, prostitution, and trafficking,тАЭ wrote Rashida Manjoo, a UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women. When some of them have dared to protest, they are further isolated and threatened of rape, or arson or an acid attack. The women succumb to defending their fragile honour. Bonded Labour Anti-slavery International reports that about 80% of bonded labourers in India are from untouchable or indigenous backgrounds. And the Global Slavery Index shows that India alone accounts for half of the worldтАЩs modern slaves today. The index further cites caste and tribe systems as primary factors that influence the prevalence of modern slavery, zeroing in on Dalit women and children as most vulnerable here. The bigotry in the minds of the dominant caste is both ignorant and deliberate. They assume they can do whatever they please. They feel licensed to go to Dalit houses, rooms, or beds without the fear of law enforcement or a criminal justice system. When the girls or their families consider complaining to the authorities, they get humiliated to the point of despair; just to be тАШtaught a lesson.тАЩ In most cases, Dalit girls feel profoundly isolated as sexual assault survivors. Blaming victims of sexual violence for their own assault is part of a deeply entrenched pattern in our society. тАЬWhy didnтАЩt you scream or fight back?тАЭ or worse, тАЬYou seem to have enjoyed it in silence,тАЭ are things they hear when they find the courage to come out. Just as Nigerian writer, Ijeoma Umebinyou puts it: тАЬYou see in a culture like ours, we were never taught the importance of healing. We were only taught to survive. Not heal, but bury and survive.тАЭ In India as well, the problem breeds more problems, and violence against avarnas is incestuous. How do we fix this? тАЬThey threaten us with rape, jail, even murder. Still, we refuse to be silenced. We found the courage to fight for our rights тАУ surely the world must find the courage to support us,тАЭ Dalit woman human rights defender. Women who apparently escape and find themselves a career and future abroad seem to be better off. In the opening chapter of her book Ants Among Elephants, Dalit writer Gidla writes that years ago at a bar in Atlanta, she told a guy she was an untouchable and he said, тАЬOh, but youтАЩre so touchable.тАЭ It is тАЬa very innocent and strange thing to encounter,тАЭ she later says in an interview, тАЬBut come to India and the encounters plus questions posed to the English-speaking Dalit woman get weirder.тАЭ At home, Dalit women rarely have the latitude to prove merit or exercise creativity and independent judgment. In the case of Gilda at the Jaipur Literature Festival, which is a space of intellectual synergy, she says, тАЬThey didnтАЩt give a shit about me even though I wrote a great book.тАЭ Fixing systemic problems like bigotry and violence that are deeply imbued in courts of justice, education systems, healthcare, and other public spaces cannot be accomplished through a single revolution, however organized it is. Professor Vimal Thorat, the Convenor of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights said, тАЬIn our experience of monitoring violence against Dalit women, the ineffectiveness of criminal justice system compounded by wilful negligence by the police to investigate the cases within the prescribed legal framework is evident.тАЭ Identity politics: The good, the bad, and the struggling Changing the broken casteist and patriarchal system cannot happen merely by the way we talk about women and sex. It doesnтАЩt just start with sexist or casteist beliefs at home. The struggle is larger than personal tragedies, it is a political validation of trauma and oppression. Dalit women have been actively involved in anti-caste and anti-untouchability movements since the 1920s. The self-respect movement, taking from PeriyarтАЩs principles has been effective but unable to put an end to the structural exclusion. Identity politics in this case scenario has helped Dalits re-forge their identity, fight for rights, bring positive changes like taking legal action against caste-based atrocities, political and economic empowerment of Dalit women. While it holds on to the title of being avarna or Dalit, it does so with a subaltern narrative and leverages facts against a system that is steeped with patriarchal and casteist beliefs. The National Federation for Dalit Women was launched by Dalit women and is committed to making a progressive change in a so-called тАШpost-caste era.тАЩ But what lies at stake is their livelihood and survival on a daily basis, therefore, making it impossible for them to organise themselves formally.

272,The story of the Constitution of India as a House Building: To be told on Jan 25 at Dalit Shakti Kendra,"COUNTERVIEW.ORG Voluntary blogging platform  On the Republic day eve, January 25, GujaratтАЩs premier Dalit rights organization, Navsarjan Trust, will be releasing Constitution House, an 8 inch X 6 inch X 6 inch wooden structure, in order to explain the the basic fundamentals of the Constitution of India. The Constitution House will be introduced at 11:30 am at the Dalit Shakti Kendra, Nani Devti, Sanand Taluka, Ahmedabad district. Those who are likely to join the programme include Bezwada Wilson, the Magsaysay award winning social activist who has been relentlessly fighting for the eradication of manual scavenging; Jyotsna Yagnik, former principal judge, City Civil and Sessions Court, Ahmedabad; Minar Pimple, former senior director, Global Operations, Amnesty International; and Madhusudan Mistry, Rajya Sabha MP, and founder of tribal rights organization Disha. A note on the Constitution House by Navsarjan Trust founder Martin Macwan: Each family needs a House. Many families make a village, city, state and country. The homogeneity makes country the larger family. The country too, therefore needs a House. What does the House do? It gives us security. It protects us from external dangers. It protects us from rains, excessive heat or cold. It creates homogeneity, the feeling of тАШwe are one, we are unitedтАЩ among the family members. The home protects us and makes us feel secured. We too protect the house from corrosion, damage. We clean it every day, and may be twice a day. We repair the roof, we paint the walls, we mend the fence. Be it a cement-brick house or be it a mud or bamboo house. We maintain it and keep it clean and safe. Each adult wants to build both, the family and the house. Years ago, India did not have house of its own. It was enslaved by the British, the French, the Dutch. They came here to do business and slowly claimed Indian soil as their property. We Indians, became тАШtenantsтАЩ in our own house. The тАШtenantsтАЩ do not feel at home in a rented house. Because after all they are тАШtenantsтАЩ and not the тАШownersтАЩ. India then was a home to princely states. It was not a country. How could it be a country when it was not independent and divided into more than 600 princely states? The revolt of 1857 against the British rule was an important milestone in raising national independent consciousness. There were other incidents of revolt in India earlier too. As the uprising grew stronger against the British Rule, the British proposed more rights for Indian тАШsubjectsтАЩ. They promised to design the house for India, a Constitution. However, our freedom fighters told the British to тАШQuit IndiaтАЩ. Said, тАЬwe will build our own house, the way we want, after your departureтАЭ. Came 1947. We became independent and India became an independent country. But before the British departed. They put oil in the fire and promoted communal separation. India was split into two countries. Later two split into three. The family broke. There were many who pushed the idea that the new countries should be designed according to the religious identity of the majority. However, people and leaders of both the countries rejected it. People of all faith continued to live in separated countries. There were violent communal riots all over. And yet, India decided to be тАШSecularтАЩ, a home to people of all religions. Thus came the time for India to design and build its own house, a Constitution. A house that can make all secured and equal. It was not an easy task. India was home to people from different faith. They spoke different languages. They dressed differently. And different was their customs, the food and the culture. We call it diversity. The common among all the difference was the identity, тАШWe are IndiansтАЩ. This identity became the slogan. The slogan was taught to every child in the school. тАШIndia is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sistersтАЩ. Thus began the story of designing the Indian house, the Constitution of India.  Land To build a house, we need a piece of land that we тАШownтАЩ. India now had a land of its own. It owned the land, the rivers, the rivulets, the mountains and valleys, the seas and the sky. Before we start construction and select the location of the house we do consult many people, especially who have seen the past, to check facts as the water levels that left their water marks during major floods etc. We do this, to ensure that our house can survive man natural and human designed calamities. Framers our constitution too had studies Constitutions of various countries. We learnt about the importance of human Liberty, in the backdrop of popular movements against slavery and marginalization of masses such as the French revolution and the struggle for Peach in Ireland. They also learnt about the importance of human rights from the US history of Slavery. Ground-breaking ceremony, the тАШBhoomi PujanтАЩ Before we start the construction, we do the ground-breaking ceremony. People of all faith do the ceremony, as it is more cultural than religious. We clean the land. We dress well, we invite relatives and friends. We declare our intention to build the house. We dream what a house would look like. We agree that along with our family members, the house will be open to birds, the insects, the pets, the plants and the trees. Because, it is the nature that keeps us alive. We promise the nature, that we will protect you. India too had a legal contract with the nature. We will keep our rivers clean. We will protect forest, we will plant trees and water them. We will have a national animal, a national bird, a national fruit, a national flower. After all the birds, the animals, the sunlight, the air, the dust, the water are not property of a country. They do not require passport or visa, to fly, to roam around, to flow, to hum, to shine. They are Independent, beyond human тАШcontrolтАЩ. So India decided to be a home to citizens and the nature. Thus, the ground-breaking ceremony was completed. The Foundation The Foundation has to be deep until it reaches the hard land. The building on soft land may cave in. It has to be wide enough to house a wall, able to bear the weight of the upcoming structure. Once the Foundation is dug, there has to be a layer of brickbats to strengthen the foundation bottom layer over the soil. Brickbats of various sizes are broken into small pieces, They are dumped into foundation and watered before it is crushed until dusted by pounding of spalling hammer. Brickbats resembles our prejudices, of caste, gender, religious sectarianism in the country. Unless they are melted, dusted into a layer of solid concrete-like earth under the foundation wall, the spirit of тАШSecularismтАЩ will not become a reality. The Foundation Wall and Otlo When the Foundation wall, broad, rises above the ground level and up to the plinth, we extend the outer portion to construct an Otta or Otlo. Otlo is used by other community members, who converse and assemble to discuss community matters, or to gossip. Otlo becomes the community talking point. In the times of festivals, we paint Otlo with floral Rangoli designs. In our constitution house, the Otlo welcomes all citizens with a message: тАШIndia is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sistersтАЩ. Every village therefore has a Chora, a common assembly point. True, the challenge remains to ensure that people across differences of Caste and Religion can assemble there.  The Door Over the plinth level wall , we put a concrete band. The band gives strength to the house against earthquakes. The band also does not allow the termite from the ground to enter the home. This band takes the load of the upper structure. The band level also, later, matches the floor level of the house. Over the band, we erect the door frame. The door decides whom to let in and whom not to. In our Constitution, the door represents the guiding principle of EQUALITY. It is open to all the citizens of India, irrespective of caste, race, gender or religion. The award of citizenship in India is not based on Religion. The constitution does not have name of any God or Goddess in its pages. The Windows The windows in our house provides us with oxygen-rich fresh air, and the sunlight. We fix windows on both the opposite walls, cross ventilation, to continue receiving light and air with the change in direction of the earth and wind. The absence of windows would suffocate us and lack of oxygen would depress us. The windows in our Constitution represents Fundamental Rights on one wall. The Fundamental rights are rights which no Government can take away. On the Contrary, it is bounded duty of the State to protect fundamental rights of the citizens. Article 14 guarantees that all citizens are equal before the law and will have equal protection of law. Article 15 says that the State shall not discriminate with any citizen on the grounds of Race, Caste, Sex, Religion or place of Birth. Article 16 guarantees equal opportunity to all in Public employment. Article 17 makes practice of Untouchability, a punishable offense. Article 21 guarantees all citizens right to life with dignity. Merely surviving in dire poverty is not a dignified life. Article 25 gives right to citizens to practice, profess and propagate faith according to their conscience. Whether to believe in religion or not, or to find for what is religious is the right of the citizens and no scriptures can dictate. The windows on the other well provide liberties to the citizens; freedom of thought and expression; liberty to assemble without arms, peacefully, to form associations, to move around the country without obstruction, to reside in any part of the country and to do any profession of choice. No one can be forced to stick to caste based occupations. India has witnessed several riots against reservation. Why reservation when we are all equal, is the argument. The Constitution has an answer. The Constitution provides equality but the inequality in society, economic and social is a reality. We need to create conditions through reservation, to ensure all are equal in true sense. The reservation exists for Dalit, Tribal, OBC and the Women in the fields of Public services, higher education and electoral politics. The Roof Roof is important to the house. It protects us from rain and external damages. The roof needs maintenance. House without roof holds little meaning. The roof in the Constitution resembles to the duties of the citizens. Rights and duties of the citizens are two sides of the coin. If we focus only on the rights and ignore the duties the roof can collapse. Three duties of the citizens are eye-catching and tells us how deeply the Constitution has thought over them. All citizens are asked to transcend narrow religious, linguistic, regional and other divisions and promote harmony and brotherhood. All citizens are asked to renounce practices which are derogatory to dignity of women. All Citizens are asked to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform. We all like to climb over the roof to fly kites especially. The roof also gives us the larger view of our village or area. We feel elevated on the roof. We are proud of our roof. The Constitution is equally proud of the National anthem. When we recite the anthem, the words create images before our closed eyes of India, its mountains, Its rivers, Its ocean, Its people. Original song is longer than we sing and it was composed by Rabindranath Tagore, much before India became independent.  The Minorities In our family we care most for children, the aged and the sick as they are the minority in our family. The constitution of India provides special protection to the Minorities. In India we have defined minorities based on religion and Language. The special protection is to ensure that a section of society on the grounds of being Majority cannot deprive the Minorities. The rights of Minorities include: The right to preserve ones language, script and culture. The right to establish and administer educational institutions and avail State funding without discrimination. The right to admission in State run educational institutions. The Constitution prohibits religious teachings in State aided educational institutions. The Basic House Rules which are Non-negotiable Each family has governing rules for the family to function which are non-negotiable. India too governing rules set up by the Constitution which are non-negotiable for the governance of the Country. These rules or rather the founding principles are the following: Sovereign: We are not slaves. We will make our own laws. We will determine our Policies. Democratic: The Government shall be of the People, for the People and it will be by the People. Socialist: The economy of the country will not be determined and controlled by few, but it will be controlled by all. Water well and food storage: Food and water are basic requirement of the Citizens. They are linked to both, the Policies of the State and the Environment. The Constitution has spelt тАШDirective Principles for State PoliciesтАЩ. The Policies have to be such that they end in fulfilling the rights of the citizens enshrined in the Constitution. While framing these Principles, the Constitution has affirmed that: The Economic Inequality in India is a reality. Everyone does not have land, employment, regular income and asset. The rich have more economic power than the poor. The men has more economic power than women, though it is women who contributes much more labour as compared to men. The Social Inequality in India is a Reality: There are more poor amongst Dalits and Tribal communities because of social realities such as Caste. The aged, the sick, the women and the Minorities are more vulnerable to deprivation. In spite of its wealth, Malnutrition amongst children is a reality. Therefore, what should be the Policies which can eradicate economic and social Inequality? Directive principles are guiding principles for the State to frame Policies. The various programs that have emerged in India, after Independence such as Land re-distribution; Law on Minimum wages, MNREGA, the rights of workers of organized or unorganized sectors, compulsory education until the age of 14, Rights of women in the family property have been rooted in these directive Principles. Directive Principles also focus on access to justice, No citizens be deprived of justice for lack of money; Hence there is Free Legal Aid as a right. The separation of Judiciary from the Executive is ensured. Lastly, there is focus on protection of environment; the land-forest-water and air. The Principles direct us to adopt scientific agriculture and animal husbandry. But, just like in the case of water well, as the water can not rise itself and fill our pots, the Policies and Programs do not walk to our doorsteps. The citizens have to pull the water from the well through handpump. The alertness from the Citizens about their rights requires to be maintained at all the times. The Owners of the House: Who owns the House? The house of Indian Constitution is owned by all its citizens irrespective of their caste, sex, language, religion or region. The Name Plate: Each house has a name plate. A name on the plate that defines and tells the world about the unique identity of the house. The name plate of the house of Indian Constitution is: The Undivided Indian State. Amidst social, linguistic, religious, cultural and linguistic diversities, this is the house of all, UNDIVIDED INDIAN NATION. Therefore there was no other Nation, there is no other Nation and there will be no other Nation. Few Words of the People who Built House: Our fore-parents, who have struggled for their life to build the house, always depart with few words for the next Generation to counsel them. What were the words of framers of Indian Constitution? Dr Ambedkar said: тАЬHowever good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it , happen to be bad lot. However bad a constitution may be, it may turn out to be good, if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.тАЭ Our struggle as citizen continues as expected by the framers of the constitution to ensure that our rights are protected, as attempts to take them away will be a reality.

293,House of suspect in Dalit boy├втВмтДвs murder vandalised,"The inebriated youth killed the boy for mocking at him Published: 02nd January 2020 05:29 AM | Last Updated: 02nd January 2020 05:29 AM | A+A A- A house belonging to of one of the accusedтАЩs relatives which was vandalised by the kin of Nagulan | EXPRESS THOOTHUKUDI: Security was beefed up and officials were keeping a watchful eye on North Muthalapuram in the district, where a group of vandals swooped down on the houses of the man suspected of murdering a six-year-old boy. The vandals reportedly damaged the houses of ArulrajтАЩs (26) parents and siblings, apart from setting afire a couple of bikes. However, Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police Arun Balagopalan told TNIE that the situation was under control and police were keeping the issue from snowballing. Nagulan (6), son of Jaishankar and Revathi of North Muthalapuram, was allegedly strangulated to death by one Arulraj (26) of the same village. While Nagulan belongs to a Dalit community, Arulraj is from a Backward Class community. The boyтАЩs body was found amid bushes on the outskirts of North Muthalapuram on Tuesday. Police said Arulraj, who was drunk during the incident, confessed to having killed Nagulan after the boy mocked him. On Wednesday, NagulanтАЩs relatives allegedly vandalised the houses of ArulrajтАЩs parents, brother and sister. They also damaged the house of ArulrajтАЩs friend, besides setting fire to two vehicles parked in front of ArulrajтАЩs house, sources claimed. Alarmed by the development, people from ArulrajтАЩs community said they grieved for the boy, but found the act of vandalism unethical. Meanwhile, the Superintendent of Police said, тАЬWe are monitoring the situation. We are waiting for a complaint from the victims to register a case.тАЭ Arulraj is a suspect in many theft and robbery cases under Kovilpatti, Masarpatti and Ettayapuram police station limits. He was arrested a few years ago in connection with the murder of a 60-year-old woman. O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

301,"Acquittal of Babri accused, gang rape of UP Dalit woman are interlinked; have roots in the history | SabrangIndia","September 30, 2020 will be marked as another dark day in our history Image Courtesy:in.news.yahoo.com It was the day when a court in Uttar Pradesh (UP) acquitted the leaders of the ruling right-wing Hindutva nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the highly publicised Babri Masjid demolition case. The ancient mosque was razed to the ground in 1992 by the supporters of the BJP in Ayodhya. The Hindutva Right continues to claim that the mosque was built by the Mughal invaders after destroying a temple of Lord Ram, a revered Hindu god. Although it has been well documented that the 1992 incident was the result of a well-planned conspiracy and a culmination of an ongoing agitation for Ram temple by the BJP, the court in UP being governed by the party has ruled in favour of the accused saying this was done by тАЬanti-social elementsтАЭ and exonerating those involved in mobilizing Hindu majority against the mosque for years. Those acquitted are former Deputy Prime Minister of India, L.K. Advani, besides few former union ministers. The verdict comes months after the Indian Supreme Court gave the title of the land to the Hindus even as the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already laid the foundation stone for a grand Ram temple as per the promise made by BJP to the electorate. The question of restoring the land to the Muslims does not arise anymore, especially under Modi, who enjoys a brute majority in the parliament. While the September 30 decision was awaited, a Dalit woman, who was struggling for life in the hospital died after being brutally raped and tortured in UP. 20-year-old Manisha belonged to the so called untouchable community and was being harassed by the men from 'upper caste'. She was assaulted two weeks ago. It has been revealed that the police too tried to shield the suspects and cremated the body of the deceased by keeping her parents away to hush up the evidence. Notably, the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath is notoriously known for giving free hand to the police to kill Muslims in faked encounters after blaming them to be criminals and terrorists, but right under his nose, the police have tried to save those responsible for the rape and murder of a Dalit woman. The two incidents are interlinked in historical sense. The two developments have evoked ugly memories of December 6, 1992, the day when Babri Masjid was pulled down by the mobs. It was also the death anniversary of a towering Dalit icon and a scholar Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Ambedkar had coauthored the Indian constitution that guarantees religious freedom and was a vocal critic of the Hindutva Right that believes in an orthodox caste system that discriminates against Dalits. Ambedkar himself grew up facing blatant discrimination from the 'upper-caste' Hindus and had warned that if ever India becomes a Hindu state it will have a devastating effect. His prophecy was proven right when the Babri Mosque was attacked under a BJP government in UP. It is hard to say whether the BJP goons had purposely picked December 6 as a day of action to send a message to the followers of Ambedkar, but this ugly coincidence was a reminder of what Ambedkar had forewarned about Hindu theocracy. Today, 28 years later that Hindutva privilege has repeated that by exonerating those involved in the demolition and trying to cover up a heinous crime against a Dalit woman. It is like the proverbial killing of two birds (read Muslims and Dalits) with one stone. It shouldnтАЩt surprise anyone how the Muslim haters and casteists have become emboldened under the rule of Modi and Adiyanath. Since they both subscribe to the racist text of Manusmriti тАУ a Hindu text that justifies caste-based atrocities, this was always anticipated in a BJP regime. The Muslims and Dalits have no choice but to revisit Ambedkar and find a way to fight back together instead of fighting separately on the question of religion and caste. These parallels should be an eye-opener for not just these two communities, but everyone considering how attacks on all the religious minorities, and the oppressed groups besides political dissidents have grown ever since Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014. From BJP perspective, they all are enemy aliens, who have been repeatedly othered for both short term electoral gains and to maintain Hindu supremacy.

315,Top court notice to Centre on plea for SC status for Dalit Christians,"The Supreme Court issued notice to the Centre Wednesday on a plea seeking Scheduled Caste (SC) status for Dalit Christians. Appearing for the petitioner, National Council of Dalit Christians, advocates Thomas Franklin Caesar and Gowthaman told a bench of Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant that change in religion does not change social exclusion, and that there was caste discrimination in Christianity too. The Chief Justice remarked that the same argument could be raised in the case of the Muslim community as well, and added that the court will therefore have to hear the matter in detail. The petition wants the court to declare as unconstitutional paragraph (3) of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, which states, тАЬтАжno person who professes a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism and Budhism shall be deemed to be a member of a scheduled caste.тАЭ The plea sought delinking of religion from consideration of Scheduled Caste status, and making the SC category relgion neutral.

356,"Rohith Vemula was Not a Dalit; Committed Suicide Because He was Troubled, Says Inquiry Panel | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Newsclick Image by Nitesh Kumar тАЬMy birth is my fatal accidentтАЭ. On January 17, 2016, a brilliant Hyderabad Central University scholar, Rohith Vemula was pushed to commit suicide and left behind a searing note talking of unfinished dreams and how he felt his тАЬbirth was his fatal accidentтАЭ. Vemula, a Dalit student and a PhD candidate at Hyderabad Central University, had been suspended along with four others, after a complaint by the local unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the BJP. His fellowship was suspended for more than 7 months, for raising тАЬissues under the banner of the ASA. Vemula found it difficult to manage his expenses, and after removing him and the four other students from their hostel rooms, they set up a tent inside the campus and began a relay hunger strike. Not being able to bear the humiliation meted out to them, Vemula lost hope and took his life. Many have called it an тАЬInstitutional MurderтАЭ, as the government machinery was used to settle political scores between two organisations. After his death, the whole country was awakened with his moving last letter. The university and the government has since then tried to focus on VemulaтАЩs caste rather than the cause of the tragedy, claiming that he was not a Dalit. The Ministry of Human Resource Development [MHRD] set up a one-man judicial commission under Justice Ashok Kumar Roopanwal on February 2, 2016, to probe the circumstances that lead to Vemula's suicide. The report was made public on 15th August 2017 and said, that although Vemula was a troubled individual, he was not a Dalit. """"His suicide note is on the record which shows that Rohith Vemula had his own problems and was not happy with worldly affairs,"""" it said. """"He was frustrated for the reasons best known to him... He also wrote that he was all alone from childhood and was an unappreciated man. This also indicates his frustration. He did not blame anybody for his suicideтАЭ. The circumstances in the University at the time were not the reason enough for the scholarтАЩs suicide, the probe revealed. In addition, the report indicated that the then HRD minister Smriti Irani and Union Minister Bandaru Dattareya were not responsible for the episode. Even though Vemula had written a letter to the UniversityтАЩs Vice Chancellor, Appa Rao Podile, expressing his anger at the Dalit issues in the varsity as well as the issue of expulsion, the commission concluded that it had nothing to do with his suicide. Regarding the disciplinary action taken in the case of Vemula, Justice Roopanwal's report said: """"In my opinion, the view taken by the Executive Council was the most reasonable one in the circumstances prevailing at that time. The Executive Council mainly focused that the students should concentrate on their academic career and not on other things. The leniency shown by the Executive Council itself shows that the university administration was not functioning under any influence or pressure, otherwise there could be no occasion to be lenient or to reduce the punishment recommended by the Proctorial Board."""" The report also said that if he would have been angry with the decision of the university, certainly either he would have written in specific words or would have indicated in this regard. """"Vemula did not do the same. It shows that the circumstances prevailing in the university at that time were not the reasons for committing the suicide."""" the report said. Read the full report here. The question that now arises is: Why the commission is discussing Rohith VemulaтАЩs caste? WasnтАЩt it their job to just examine the circumstances and facts which lead to his death and bring the perpetrators, if any, to justice? The commission was mainly created to review the functioning of the grievance committee and had to suggest mechanisms for improvement. Then why do the CommissionтАЩs final findings dedicate four pages out of 12 to whether Rohith was a Dalit? RohithтАЩs letter to the Vice chancellor in December 2016, in which he wrote about the caste discrimination and asked for cyanide and rope for Dalit students, has been completely ignored by the report. Instead, it has questioned the deceasedтАЩs family background and caste. The Commission has observed that the university's equal opportunity cell is not functional. And yet it doesn't explore why the grievance redressal committees are ineffective. Or how they could be made better. 1) Letter dated 10th August, 2015, to Bandaru Dattatreya written by Nandanam Diwakar, brother of Susheel Kumar, Vice President, BJP, Ranga Reddy District. 2) Letter dated 17th August, 2015, from Bandaru Dattatreya, MoS to Smriti Irani, MHRD, detailing his idea of 'Anti-national activities' of ASA. 3) Letter dated 3rd September, 2015 from MHRD office referring to comments by Bandaru Dattatreya, Mos for Labor and Employment. 4) Second Letter from MHRD dated 24th September, 2015, sent as reminder, signed by Deputy Secretary to the Govt of India. 5) Third Letter from MHRD dated 6th October, 2015, signed by Deputy Secretary to the Govt of India. 6) Fourth Letter dated 20th October, 2015, signed by Joint Secretary, MHRD. 7) Fifth Letter from MHRD dated 19th November, 2015, signed by Under Secretary to the Govt of India 8) Rohith VemulaтАЩs letter to the VC, dated 18th December, 2015.",0,0,1,3

455,Three men get death penalty for raping and murdering Dalit woman in Telangana - Republic World,"SEARCH Quick links: India News World News Sports News Entertainment News Technology News Shows Business News Election News A special court in Telangana on Thursday sentenced three men to death for raping and murdering a Dalit woman in little over two months of the gruesome crime reported in November 2019. The court also imposed a total fine of Rs 26,000 on them. The body of the 30-year old woman with throat slit and stab marks was found in Lingapur mandal of Kumram Bheem-Asifabad district on November 25, 2019, a day after the offence. The three men--Shaik Babu (35), Shaik Shabuddin (50) and Shaik Muqdum (aged around 45), all labourers, were arrested on November 27 and booked under IPC sections 376 (D) (gang rape) and 302 (murder) besides under relevant provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and sent to judicial remand. The second and the third accused were also booked under IPC section 404 (dishonest misappropriation of property). On Thursday, Principal District and Sessions Judge M G Priyadarshini (incharge of the special court) delivered the verdict and convicted the three men under IPC section 302 (murder) and relevant provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and gave death penalty to them, Additional Public Prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. The trio was also sentenced to life imprisonment under IPC section 376 (D), while the second and the third convict were also sentenced to three-years imprisonment under IPC Section 404 for stealing the mobile phone and Rs 200 cash of the deceased. All convictions shall run concurrently. According to the Additional Public Prosecutor, the court held it as the """"rarest of the rare case"""" because it was a heinous offence against the woman by not only committing rape and killing her and also fracturing her ribs. The woman was a vendor, selling balloons for a living. Expressing happiness over the verdict, the woman's husband said """"We are happy. Justice has been meted out and we request the court that they should be hanged immediately."""" The Telangana government had last month issued orders, designating the Fifth Additional Sessions Court as the special court for speedy trial in the case. On December 14, 2019, a charge sheet was filed and the trial commenced on December 23. Arguments were completed on January 20 and the case was subsequently posted for judgment. As many 25 witnesses were produced by the prosecution which had been demanding capital punishment on the lines of death penalty awarded to the accused in the Nirbhaya gang rape murder case in Delhi.

Earlier in December, the woman's family and different people's organisations had staged protests and demanded an 'encounter' death for the three men on the lines of the four accused in the 'Disha' (woman veterinarian) gang rape and murder case.

464,"NIA probe into Bhima-Koregaon case: BJP, MVA face off over ├втВм╦Ьurban naxal├втВмтДв narrative, NCP tries to shore Dalit votes","While the tussle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over the probe into the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon violence is over the narrative of тАЬurban naxalsтАЭ, for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), it is also a bid to consolidate Dalit votes. Among the MVA allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has taken the lead to contest the BJPтАЩs тАЬurban naxalтАЭ narrative, with party chief Sharad Pawar pushing for a review of the investigation carried out under the erstwhile BJP governmentтАЩs tenure and questioning the branding of arrested activists as тАЬurban naxalsтАЭ. The Congress, too, has supported this stand openly. However, the Shiv Sena has avoided making any statements on the issue so far. While Pawar has been consistent about his opinion over the Bhima-Koregaon probe, there is also a clear political angle to this stand: It is a bid to reach out to the Dalit community that has been patently unhappy with the BJP. The majority of the community, which makes up 13% of the stateтАЩs population, is currently split between the Congress-NCP combine and Dalit leader Prakash AmbedkarтАЩs Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), even as BJP ally, Republican Party of IndiaтАЩs Ramdas Athawale continues to enjoy some support base among Dalits in urban areas. AmbedkarтАЩs outfit, which was formed after the Bhima-Koregaon violence, damaged the Congress-NCP allianceтАЩs prospects in both the Lok Sabha as well as the Vidhan Sabha polls. If not for VBA, the BJP might not have touched 100-seat mark in the state Assembly polls. With the National Investigation Agency (NIA) now taking over the probe into the Bhima-Koregaon violence, the MVA governmentтАЩs stand against the Centre is likely to win it support from Dalits in the state. And, the BJP, which is aware of this, is digging its heels to show that the investigations carried out under its government were on the dot as they uncovered a Maoist conspiracy that has repercussions for the country. тАЬThis government, especially the NCP, is clearly reaching out to the Dalits with its explicit stand against the тАШurban naxalтАЩ narrative. The party is looking at expansion in Vidarbha, where such a stand will help it expand its base. It will also help the NCP earn lost foothold in cities like Mumbai. The NCP leadersтАЩ statements point to a well-coordinated strategy to corner the BJP on this issue and shore support of Dalits,тАЩтАЩ said political analyst Hemant Desai. Pawar, as well as state home minister Anil Deshmukh, have questioned the haste with which NIA took over the Bhima-Koregaon inquiry. тАЬWhy the haste just when the state was looking at setting up an SIT? ItтАЩs because of the fear of being exposed. They are afraid the truth will come out,тАЩтАЩ said Pawar, while speaking to reporters in Mumbai on Saturday. The violence on January 1, 2018, occurred when Dalits had gathered near the war memorial to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle, in which the British army, led by the Mahar regiment, won against the ruling Peshwas. The violence had sparked Dalit protests and a bandh across the state. The police investigations under the Fadnavis regime, had pointed to a Maoist conspiracy and led to the arrest of several activists with purported Maoist links. It had also led to alienation of the Dalit community as no action was taken against Hindu hardline leaders like Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, who, Dalit leaders had alleged, were responsible for the violence. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, meanwhile, backed the NIA probe and said the MVA government was indulging in politics of votes. тАЬMaharashtra Police had investigated this case in great detail to uncover the network of тАШurban naxalsтАЩ. Charge sheets have been framed. Despite this, the government, in a bid to play politics of votes, questioned this probe,тАЩтАЩ he said. тАЬI think the decision to give it to the NIA is correct. The Maharashtra investigations had shown that the тАШurban naxal networkтАЩ is spread across India.тАЭ тАШMAHA MAY CONDUCT OWN PROBEтАЩ State energy minister Nitin Raut said the state may not cooperate with the Centre, and may conduct its own probe. тАЬWe will take a call in the next cabinet meeting. We may not cooperate with NIA and launch a probe by the Maha SIT,тАЭ he said, adding BJP has a тАЬgrudgeтАЭ against those who organised Elgar Parishad. тАЬHow can anyone call retired justices BG Kolse-Patil and PB Sawant, who were the main organisers urban naxals? If you criticise the govt, you become naxals for them [BJP]. They are taking country towards autocracy,тАЭ he added.

509,Dalit man's death: BJP accuses MP govt of minority appeasement,"The BJP on Tuesday protested over the death of a Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district and alleged the Kamal Nath government in the state was adopting a policy of minority appeasement. Dhanprasad Ahirwar (24) was doused with kerosene in Dharmshri Colony, some 170 kilometres from here, on January 14 allegedly by four people who wanted him to take back a police complaint.

Addressing a protest rally here, former chief minister and senior BJP leader Shivarj Singh Chouhan said a mob of 20- 25 people had set Ahirwar on fire. """"These persons also wanted to kill Ahirwar in 2019 but police did not take action. It was the government's duty to arrest the accused but it did not touch them because they belong to a minority community. The voice of a poor Dalit was not heard,"""" Chouhan alleged.

He asked if the Gandhi family would come to Sagar to meet the kin of the deceased.

535,SC to examine plea seeking reservation for Dalit Christians," 08-January-2020   The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to look into a plea seeking directions to the Centre to allocate benefits given to Scheduled Castes to Christians having a Scheduled Castes origin. A bench, headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, issued notice to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, the National Commission for Minorities and the Registrar General of India and sought the Centre's response within two weeks, as it tagged the plea with other similar matters. The plea also sought the Scheduled Castes community should be made religion neutral. According to the plea, a Scheduled Caste person admitting a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism should not be deprived from the benefit by Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, which restricts Christians of Scheduled Castes origin from availing the Scheduled Castes status. This restriction is against the fundamental right to equality, religious freedom and non-discrimination, it said. The plea sought allowing and extending the Scheduled Castes status to Christians of Scheduled Castes Origin for availing special privilege in education, scholarships, employment, welfare measures, panchayat elections, legislative assemblies up to Indian Parliament and for availing the legal remedy/protection under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention) of Atrocities Act, 1989 amended in the year 2018. The court was hearing the plea filed by the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC) seeking Scheduled Caste status for Dalit Christians. """"The non-inclusion of Christians in Paragraph (3)A of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, along with Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism, is discriminatory and violative of Articles 14, 15, 16 and 25 of the Constitution"""", said the plea. The plea said social exclusion does not disappear with the change in and caste hierarchy continues to exist within Christianity, despite the religion forbidding it.IANS ┬й Copyright The Weekend Leader.com, 2021.

690,"165 years ago, first female Dalit writer wrote about the ├втВм╦Ьgrief of the Mangs and the Mahars├втВмтДв","Here is a historical piece of writing by IndiaтАЩs first female Dalit writer Mukta Salve. At the time of writing this essay, she was merely 14 years old and a student at the school run by Jotirao and Savitribai Phule (Jotirao Phule, Ambedkar and others have written plainly about the plight of IndiaтАЩs Shudras-Atishudras тАУ how much they have suffered due to the brahmanical system; how they have been forced to live like animals. But Mukta Salve gives us the perspective of a 14-year-old Dalit girl on this oppression. This first female Dalit writer vented her anger 165 years ago, in an essay she wrote for the Marathi fortnightly Gyanodaya. It was published in two parts under the title тАШMang Maharachya DukhvisayiтАЩ. The first part was published on 15 February 1855 and the second part on 1 March 1855. On this special occasion, we republish below Braj Ranjan ManiтАЩs English translation of the essay. ) It humbles me to realize that God has filled the heart of an untouchable girl like me, considered to be even lower than an animal, with the pain and suffering of my people тАУ the Mahars and Mangs. The Creator of all beings has put this in my heart and while invoking His name, I dare to pen this essay with the strength I have now received. The Creator is the one who created the Mangs, the Mahars and also the Brahmans and He is the one, who is filling me with wisdom to write. He will bless my labour with a fruitful outcome.  If we attempt to refute, on the basis of the Vedas, the argument of these gluttonous Brahmans, who hate us and consider themselves vastly superior, they say that the Vedas are their own domain, their exclusive property. Now apparently, if the Vedas are only for the Brahmans, they are obviously not for us. If the Vedas belong only to the Brahmans, then it is an open secret that we do not have the Book. We are without the Book тАУ we are without any religion. If the Vedas are for the Brahmans only, then we are not bound to act according to the Vedas. If merely looking at the Vedas can get us into grievous sins (as the Brahmans claim), then would not following them be the height of foolishness? Muslims lead their life according to their Koran, English people follow their Bible and Brahmans have their own Vedas. Because they all have their own good or bad religion that they follow, they are somewhat happier than us who are without any religion. Oh, God, please tell us, what is our religion? Teach us, O God, your true religion so that we all can lead our lives according to it. Let that religion, where only one person is privileged and the rest deprived, vanish from the earth and let it never enter our minds to boast of such a [discriminatory] religion. Mukta Salve These people drove us, the poor Mangs, and Mahars, away from our own lands, which they occupied to build large buildings. And that was not all. They would make the Mangs and Mahars drink oil mixed with red lead and bury our people in the foundations of their buildings, thus wiping out generation after generation of our poor people. The Brahmans have degraded us so low; they consider people like us even lower than cows and buffaloes. Did they not consider us even lower than donkeys during the rule of Bajirao Peshwa? You beat a lame donkey, and his master retaliates. But who was there to object to the routine thrashing of Mahars and Mangs? Under BajiraoтАЩs rule, if any Mang or Mahar happened to pass in front of a gymnasium, they would cut off his head and play тАЬbat and ballтАЭ with their swords as bats and his head as a ball, on the grounds. When we were punished for even passing by their doors, where was the question of getting education, getting freedom to learn? When any Mang or Mahar would learn somehow to read and write, and if Bajirao came to know about this, he would say: education of a Mang or Mahar amounts to taking away a BrahmanтАЩs job. He used to say, тАЬHow dare they get educated? Do these Untouchables expect the Brahmans to hand over their official duties to them and move around with their shaving kits, shaving the heads of widows?тАЭ With such remarks he would punish them. An image of Mukta SalveтАЩs piece on the pages of 15 February 1855 issue of тАШGyanodayaтАЩ Secondly, were these Brahmans satisfied with prohibiting us from learning? Not at all. Bajirao went to Kashi and died an ignominious death there. But the mahars here, no less untouchable than the Mangs, also avoid the company of the Mangs. They have acquired some brahmanical traits, and consider themselves to be superior to the Mangs тАУ they also get polluted by the shadow of Mangs! Do the stony-hearted Brahmans, who proudly roam around in their so-called holy clothes to proclaim their superiority, ever feel even a frisson of compassion for us when we suffer so much on account of being labelled Untouchables? Nobody gives us employment because we are Untouchables. No job means no money. We have to endure grinding poverty. O learned pandits, fold up your selfish priestcraft and stop the prattle of your hollow wisdom and listen to what I have to say. When our women give birth to babies, they do not have even a roof over their heads. How they suffer in the rain and the cold! Please try to understand it from your own experience. If they get some disease while giving birth, where will they get money for the doctor or medicines? Was there ever any doctor among you who was human enough to treat such people free of cost? The masthead of the 15 February 1855 issue of тАШGyanodayaтАЩ The Mang and Mahar children never dare lodge a complaint even if the Brahman children throw stones at them and injure them seriously. They suffer silently because they know they have to go to the BrahmansтАЩ houses to beg for the leftover food. Alas! O God! What agony this! I will burst into tears if I write more about this injustice. Because of such oppression, the merciful God has bestowed on us, this benevolent British government. Let us see how our pain has been mitigated under this government. Earlier, Gokhale, Apate, Trimkaji, Andhala, Pansara, Kale, Behre, etc [all Brahman surnames], who showed their bravery by killing rats in their homes, persecuted us, not sparing even pregnant women, without any rhyme or reason. This has stopped now. Harassment and torture of Mahars and Mangs, common during the rule of Peshwas in Pune, have stopped. Now, human sacrifice for the foundation of forts and mansions has stopped тАУ now, nobody buries us alive. Now, our population is growing in numbers. Earlier, if any Mahar or Mang wore fine clothes, they would say that only Brahmans should wear such clothes. Seen in fine clothes, we were earlier accused of stealing such clothes. Their religion was in danger of being polluted when Untouchables put clothes around their bodies; they would tie them to a tree and punish them. But, under British rule, anybody with money can buy and wear clothes. Earlier, punishment for any wrongdoing against the upper castes was to behead the guilty UntouchableтАФ now, it has stopped. Excessive and exploitative tax has stopped. The practice of untouchability has stopped in some places. Killing has stopped on the playground. Now, we can even visit the marketplace. Under the impartial British rule, many such things have happened. As I write this, I am amazed that the Brahmans who earlier used to treat us like dirt, as I have written above, want to free us from our suffering. Not all the Brahmans though. Those who are influenced by Satan continue to hate us like before. They target and outcaste the Brahmans who are trying to liberate us. Some noble souls have started schools for Mahars and Mangs, and such schools are supported by the merciful British government. O, the Mahars and Mangs, you are poor and sick. Only the medicine of knowledge will cure and heal you. It will take you away from wild beliefs and superstitions. You will become righteous and moral. It will stop your exploitation. People who treat you like animals, will not dare to treat you like that any more. So please work hard and study. Get educated and become good human beings. But I cannot even prove this. For example, those who have received good education also sometimes surprise us by doing very bad deeds! Mukta Salve was a student at the school run by Jotirao and Savitribai Phule. At merely 14 years of age, she wrote an essay about the plight of the Mangs and the Mahars and the way to relieve it. The essay was published in the Marathi magazine 'Gyanodaya' Savitribai PhuleтАЩs letters are still relatively unknown. They demonstrate her concerns for society, love for humanity, revolt against injustices, anger against the casteist mindset and hope for building an egalitarian society, writes Siddharth рдХрдо рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рдХрд╛ рд╣реА рдзреНрдпрд╛рди рд╕рд╛рд╡рд┐рддреНрд░реАрдмрд╛рдИ рдлреБрд▓реЗ рдХреЗ рдкрддреНрд░реЛрдВ рдкрд░ рдЬрд╛рддрд╛ рд╣реИред рд╕рд┐рджреНрдзрд╛рд░реНрде рд▓рд┐рдЦрддреЗ рд╣реИ рдХрд┐ рд╕рд╛рд╡рд┐рддреНрд░реАрдмрд╛рдИ рдлреБрд▓реЗ рдХреЗ рдкрддреНрд░реЛрдВ рдореЗрдВ рд╡реНрдпрд╛рдкрдХ рд╕рдорд╛рдЬ рдХреА рдЪрд┐рдВрддрд╛, рдЗрдВрд╕рд╛рдирд┐рдпрдд рдХреЗ рдкреНрд░рддрд┐ рдЧрд╣рд░реЗ рдкреНрд░реЗрдо, рдЕрдиреНрдпрд╛рдп рдХреЗ рдкреНрд░рддрд┐ рддреАрдЦреЗ рд╡рд┐рджреНрд░реЛрд╣, рдЬрд╛рддрд┐рд╡рд╛рджреА рдорд╛рдирд╕рд┐рдХрддрд╛ рдХреЗ рдЦрд┐рд▓рд╛рдл рдЖрдХреНрд░реЛрд╢ рдФрд░ рд╕рдорддрд╛-рдЖрдзрд╛рд░рд┐рдд рд╕рдорд╛рдЬ рдХреА рдЖрд╢рд╛рдПрдВ рдЕрднрд┐рд╡реНрдпрдХреНрдд рд╣реИрдВ Those who have termed the revolt of 1857 as the first war for IndiaтАЩs independence are the fools who wanted freedom for the Hindus alone.

Two Dalit brothers, accused of theft, were beaten up and tortured allegedly by staff at a petrol station in Rajasthan on Sunday, police said. A disturbing video of the assault has emerged that shows several men beating up one of them at the petrol station at a village in Nagaur, about 230 km from Jaipur. The 24-year-old had gone to the filling station with his cousin, who is also in his early twenties. In the clip, some men are seen stripping him, violating him with a screw driver. They allegedly poured petrol on his genitals. A first information report was filed on Wednesday after the two brothers approached the cops.  """"The two men, accused of theft on Sunday, were brutally thrashed by the employees. The assault was recorded on camera and the video went viral.

719,Can Ravan├втВмтДвs Bhim Army forge Dalit unity across India? - The Federal,"The world around Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan appears to be spinning very fast, like he is at the centre of a vortex. Pressure is growing from his supporters to turn the Bhim Army into a political party. According to many in his inner circle, he could launch a new national party as early as in March 2020. But given that his inner circle is very large, it is difficult to separate legend and nail facts. For instance, he has a blood condition which requires him to undergo Phlebotomy every fortnight. The process involves drawing blood out of his system to prevent it from thickening and causing a heart attack. The legend, however, is simply that тАШRavan produces too much blood when he is angryтАЩ. The talk around him is that political offers have been streaming in from across the country ever since Ravan plunged into the anti-CAA protests. Dalit leaders from different political parties are said to be queuing up to offer support. Login Please subscribe on thefederal.com/plans/",1,3,0,0
721,Can India survive without Dalits?,"Looking at the worrying social health of India, one wonders if it is ready and willing to share space with fellow citizens who it considers the wretched Others. The othering is not limited to estrangement but graduates to violence, exclusion and repeated oppression. Newer strategies are plotted 24X7 by the upper castes to form a para-structure in order to remove them from positions of power which they see as their privilege. A person with dominant caste roots already carries a privilege of thousands of years. Added to that, various institutions that exist cater to their needs. This results in an archetype that is naturalised as pan-India, with a language, food, culture and social set-up that actually discounts the everydayness of a majority of India that comprises the Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims as well as backward classes. India is a Brahminical State, notwitstanding its secular nature. The entire system favours the twice-born savarnas, mostly Brahmins who occupy the highest position by default in all the major sectors, controlling wealth and power. If Brahmins and other savarnas enjoy these ill-gotten privileges without much question, why do they indulge in the sadistic act of forcing psychological and physical pain upon powerless subjects who they see as their serfs? Almost every Brahminical festival or celebration is anti-Dalit, and to an extent anti-Adivasi. The asuras (demons) occupy a special place, whether it is Ravana or Mahishasur, while the devas are fair-skinned Aryans. Opinion | Christina Dhanaraj writes: How Babasaheb helped me understand my identity as a Dalit-Christian Imagine living in a country where one worries constantly about oneтАЩs immediate security and safety. Handicapped by these immediate threats, the Dalits are unable to rise to their full potential. Raising a child for the Dalits under such circumstances is mortifying. So, what are the ways that the Dalits can be safe and secure enough to enjoy the fruits of a Constitution that guarantees them freedom? If hatred is such, one needs to ask if this country is even equipped to consider the Dalits as fellow, equal citizens? Babasaheb Ambedkar himself was highly sceptical of the social and economic inequalities which persist, warning that these would engender serious problems. This scepticism led him to suggest several methods for Dalit security. Ambedkar concluded that the Indian habitat was a dangerous place for the Dalits. He mooted separate settlements as one solution, which would bind the Dalits together and make them economically autonomous. Social divisions might operate in these settlements too, and there is a fear that this might see a repeat of the experiences of the Bantus in Africa. Separate settlements ended up depriving them of basic infrastructure. Opinion | Suraj Yengde writes: Hindu, Muslim, and the nonsense of it However, such fears present only an incomplete picture, as such settlements would ensure that the Dalits are not subordinates, nor merely secondary Hindus. For, I argue that Hindu India is not mentally prepared to grant equal citizenship to everyone. It lives in the fear of Others. There may be cascades of generational violence should the Dalits start replying in equal fervour. However, can the rest of India survive without them? Who will do the filthy work it has made it the sole privilege of these untouchables? Drafting Ambedkar into the Constituent Assembly was hence a good gamble. It made the Dalits nationalists in a country where no one else actually stands to defend their rights. In recently published research, Amit Thorat and Omkar Joshi say untouchability is still an everyday reality for the Dalits, with 20 per cent of urban and 30 per cent of rural India accepting that they practise it. The numbers may be far more as the information collected by the research was voluntary, with much reluctance seen in urban areas to provide answers. Half of India openly accepted acts of caste criminality. In the same research, on almost all aspects of untouchability, the Brahmins led from the front. AmbedkarтАЩs desires are yet to be fulfilled as his people continue to live his worst fears. This article first appeared in the print edition on February 9, 2020 under the title тАЬDalitality: Prejudice persists, waiting for AmbedkarтАЩs dream тАЭ Suraj Yengde, author of Caste Matters, is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Kennedy School.

725,Manoranjan Byapari dalit activist├В┬а interview with The Quint on Anti CAA NRC protests in India. Byapari says that Anti CAA NRC Protests to continue for long.,"This fight will go on because such an insensitive government & politicians have never been there in our country. Author and activist Manoranjan Byapari minces no words when talking to The Quint about the ongoing anti-CAA protests across the country. Unlike many political leaders, who seem to have taken a comfortable stand on the amended citizenship act, Byapari refuses to be taken in by the assurances given by the BJP government. He shares how the protests are not going anywhere soon and how the the government may resort to violence to subdue them. Below is an excerpt from the conversation:  On Ongoing Anti CAA-NRC Protests  People are expressing dissent against CAA-NRC in Kolkata. Everyday a procession is being taken out. Students, youngsters and mostly women; particularly women from the Muslim community who have never stepped out of their houses, even they have started coming out of their houses now and are taking part in the protest. It is very clear that the government will not bow down to these protests. They will have to employ the use of machine guns and air bombs, before which this stops. This fight has just taken off. This fight will go on in the future too. This is because such an insensitive government and politicians have never been in our country before. They donтАЩt know the value of the lives of people. They will stretch themselves to the extreme, from where they will either lose or win. If they win, then it will be a deadly day, not just for Indians but for humans as a race. If humans (protesters) are able to win then it will pave the way for a new society.  On BJP GovernmentтАЩs Assurances With Respect to CAA-NRC  You transformed into a snake and bit us and now you say that you will provide us with first-aid for the same. Why did you bring forth this bill in the year 2003? This bill was brought in by you. Before this people had Voter Card, Aadhar Card, Pan Card and some even had passports. It was through their votes that you came to power. Today you are standing against it saying that all these documents hold no value and you will create new papers and give them to people which will prove whether one is a citizen. So, somewhere or the other it shows that you have something else going on in your mind. A lot like the saying that elephantтАЩs tooth is different to see and entirely different to chew. Bangladesh will not accept us and you say that we donтАЩt belong here. So, you think we have been dropped from the skies here? Where has our country gone? You tell us where to stay, then. You are creating detention camps for us and telling us that we have to stay there. We will not accept this. So many people have come on the streets and they donтАЩt want to go to detention camps.  On Mamata Banerjee  Look, up until now her stand has been appreciation worthy. But she is the Chief Minister and we never know as to when she changes her stance to what and where, no one can tell. The common man has waged a war with the government. The common man has taken to the streets. As you are already seeing the poor vote percent that CPM gets. But when they take out the procession, lakhs of people take part in it. These people who take part in the procession are not from CPM, they are the ones who are against this law. They are standing up and fighting the war. Any party which disassociates themselves from these processions will lose the support of the common man.  On Mayawati and Chandrashekhar  Now that MayawatiтАЩs name has come into the pictureтАФshe was elected as the Chief Minister by the Dalits. Then why have the Dalits turned against her? This means that you have not been able to fall through to her expectations and that is why people have lost their trust in you. Now, Mayawati is not even outrightly rejecting this Law because CBI is after her. She is scared that if she stands against them then she will be sent to the gallows. So, she is not able to speak as openly as Chandrashekhar Azad aka Ravan is able to. He is not scared of speaking. Mayawati is scared of speaking as she saw how things panned out for Lalu Prasad Yadav. Somewhere or the other these people have done something or the other which is causing them to be scared of CBI and SIT. That is why these people have not been able to openly protest against it. They also feel the need to ask as to how long must they protest? As long as they get permission enough to roast their political bread, they protest. Just stating that she is a messiah and a revered minister of the Dalit community is wrong. If you look closely, you will find out that more than half of the leadership actually belongs to the upper castes. Therefore, it is no longer a question of what she is doing. It is a question of what the people are doing. (At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience. Play an active role in shaping our journalism by becoming a member.

726,24-year-old Dalit man lynched near Villupuram in Tamil Nadu,"A 24-year-old Dalit man near Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, was lynched when he squatted by the road to defecate. In a shocking incident, a 24-year-old Dalit man was lynched near Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, when he squatted by the road to defecate, his family alleged. The incident took place on Wednesday, and the police on Friday arrested seven people after videos of the torture began circulating, reported The Indian Express. Preliminary reports suggested that Sakthivel belongs to the SC Adi Dravida community, a Dalit caste and the village where he was attacked is dominated by Vanniyars, a socially powerful OBC community in Tamil Nadu. There have been several such similar incidents in the past. A case has been registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with IPC Section 302 (punishment for murder). An allegation that has surfaced now is that Sakthivel was beaten for allegedly flashing at a woman, the report said. A senior police officer told The Indian Express that a few villagers had seen the victim remove his pants fully before squatting on the roadside, which allegedly startled a woman walking by. She narrated to the publication that Sakthivel had finished his night duty at the petrol pump and reached home on Wednesday morning. He had received a call from his colleagues, asking him to come with his documents for some official verification. He ran out of fuel on the way and had informed his family, he was also not feeling well and тАШsaid he would sit by the roadside to defecate.тАЩ In some time, the family received a call from some man who said Sakthivel was tied up and that he was in their custody at Boothur Hills. Theivanai rushed to the location with a relative on a two-wheeler and her six-month-old baby. She found Sakthivel bleeding profusely from his mouth and nose, and saw over 15-20 people kicking him to the ground, reported The Times of India. Police allegedly reached only two hours after the violence began. The family managed to get him out of there and it was only after they reached home, did they realise that Sakthivel had passed away. Villupuram SP D Jayakumar told The Indian Express, that they are probing the caste angle to the murder. (WIth inputs from The Times of India and The Indian Express.)

He is survived by a wife and a five-year-old son.

736,Dalit Assault Case: Activists Say Police Had Accused Register FIRs Against Victims,"The two FIRs were filed within 44 minutes of each other at the Panchaudi police station in Nagaur. A screenshot from the video of the attack. Jaipur: After two Dalit boys in RajasthanтАЩs Nagaur were brutally assaulted and filmed, activists have alleged that the state police, after registering their FIR, encouraged the accused to file a counter-FIR under charges of theft against the victims. The time of registration of the counter-FIRs circumstantially supports their claim. The Wire accessed copies of the FIRs: the family of the boys filed an FIR numbered #11 at the Panchaudi police station in Nagaur against the accused for assault and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act on February 19 at 3:10 pm. The accused subsequently filed FIR #12 against the victims for theft 44 minutes later, at 3:54 pm. тАЬThe Dalit identity of the boys gave the mob a sort of licence to beat them mercilessly,тАЭ B.L. Bhati, president of the Ambedkar Welfare society in Nagaur, told The Wire. тАЬIf the mob had beaten up the boys for so-called theft, then why were they not the first to register an FIR? It was the police who encouraged the accused to file an FIR against the boys.тАЭ He also claimed one of the accused, who owned a motorbikes agency, offered Rs 40,000 to the victimтАЩs father in front of the police to not file an FIR. The accused are named Bhiv Singh, Aidan Singh, Jassu Singh, Sawai Singh, Hanuman Singh, Ganpat Ram and Laxman Singh. According to the police, all seven have been arrested. Local residents also accused the station house officer of favouring the accused as they belonged to his caste. тАЬThe police in-charge and the accused are of the same caste,тАЭ Prithvi Singh Meghwal, a resident who was present with the family at the police station, told The Wire. тАЬThatтАЩs why he was pressurising the family to settle the matter without an FIR but [the family] stood firm.тАЭ However, the station house officer of the Panchaudi police station, Rajpal Singh, said they had asked the victims to register an FIR, not the accused. тАЬ[The victims] were not willing to register an FIR against the matter. So after the video went viral, we asked them to register an FIR,тАЭ he told The Wire. тАЬSoon after, the accused also came out to register an FIR against the victim. How could we stop anyone who wants to register an FIR?тАЭ On February 16, the young men, named Vissa Ram (23) and Panna Ram (18), both residents of Sonnagar in Nagaur, had visited an automobile repair shop named Om Automobile Hero agency about 5 km from their home. There, they were attacked by the shop owner and other staff after some amount of money was found missing from a safe. The assaulters grabbed the boys and inserted a screwdriver dipped in petrol into the young menтАЩs private parts. Frightened, the young men returned home and didnтАЩt utter a word about the assault. The family only came to know of the incident after three days when the video of the violence went viral. Bhura Ram, Vissa RamтАЩs brother, said, тАЬHis elder brother recognised him in the video and informed us. We then asked the boys what had happened that day. As we got to know about it, we went straight to the police to report it. [The police] kept us waiting until afternoon and then registered an FIR.тАЭ However, he refused to speak against the police. тАЬIn matters of caste atrocities, the victims are often pressurised to keep their mouth shut,тАЭ Bhati said. тАЬIn this case, too, the victims are turning hostile because of the indulgence of politicians.тАЭ The police registered an FIR against the accused under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) and 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act. In their counter-FIR, the accused have claimed that the two Dalit men came to their shop at lunch time and, when nobody was looking, broke the safe and stole Rs 50,000. Ten minutes after they left, the shopтАЩs owner discovered the safe was broken and, after checking the CCTV footage, determined one of the duo had stolen money from the safe. тАЬWe had recognised them in the CCTV footage so we went to search them in the village and found the two at the nearby circle. We nabbed them, brought them to the shop and beat them to make them confess,тАЭ the FIR filed by the accused reads.",0,0,1,3
737,Gujarat: Dalit armyman rides mare on wedding day; pelted with stones in police presence,"Ahmedabad: Despite social reforms and promulgation of strict laws, some people do sadly continue to follow customs that belong to a time-warped era. In a fresh case, a Dalit groom, who is serving in the Indian Army, was not allowed to ride a mare on his wedding day in Gujarat. The groom and the wedding party (baraat) was pelted with stones when it was proceeding to the wedding venue in the state's Banaskantha district. What was shocking was that the miscreants from another community attacked the wedding party despite police protection being provided to the groom. Open threats to Dalit family According to a report in Indian Express, the incident took place on January 16 (Sunday) at Sharifda village when the 22-year-old groom identified as Akash Kumar Koitiya began his wedding procession. Koitiya has just finished his training with the military police and was scheduled to deploy in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh. The jawan was on leave for his wedding. The groom's family said they had received threats from the Thakor Koli community not to pass the wedding procession through the village if the jawan rode a mare. """"After threats, we had requested police to give us protection. Police gave us 6-7 personnel for the security of the wedding procession. As we started to move, some people started to throw stones at us. The groom barely escaped injuries and was rushed to a police van. However, three persons including two women sustained injuries in the stone-pelting,"""" said Vijay Koitita, the groom's brother. The groom's family had received threats in advance from the upper caste if the youth rode the mare (Representative image) Police protection to groom Vijay is also an army man and is currently deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. After the attack, a number of policemen were rushed to the village. """"A contingent of 50-60 policemen was sent to accompany the wedding procession to the bride's village that was in Sundha area of Palanpur city. Later, the wedding passed off without any incident,"""" said Dalpat Bhatia, a Dalit rights activist.

745,Tamil Nadu: 24-year-old Dalit youth lynched in Villupuram for defecating by roadside,"Support Scroll.in Support Scroll.in Your support is crucial: India needs independent media and independent media needs you.  Seven people, including three women, have been arrested in Tamil NaduтАЩs Villupuram district on charges of lynching a 24-year-old Dalit youth after he defecated by a village road, The Indian Express reported on Sunday. The attack occurred on Wednesday in a village dominated by Vanniyars, a powerful Other Backward Class community in north and north-western Tamil Nadu. The victim was identified as R Sakthivel from Karai village. He worked at a petrol pump. The accused were arrested on Friday after videos of the lynching were circulated in the area. SakthivelтАЩs sister claimed it was a caste murder. тАЬOn Tuesday, he was on night duty at the petrol pump and reached home on Wednesday morning,тАЭ R Theivanai told the newspaper. тАЬLater, he received a call from his colleagues, asking him to come with his Aadhaar card and a photo for some official verification. When he left home around 1.30 pm, he mentioned how there was only a little petrol in his two-wheeler.тАЭ Sakthivel later called his sister to inform her that he had run out of petrol, and added he would defecate by a road. Soon after, Theivanai received a call from her brotherтАЩs phone. An unidentified man told her that a mob had tied up Sakthivel. тАЬHe asked me to reach Boothur Hills [about 5 km from their home],тАЭ she added. тАЬIt was clear there was some problem.тАЭ When Theivanai reached the spot, she saw 15 to 20 people had gathered around her brother. тАЬWhen I reached, they beat him some more,тАЭ she added. тАЬI tried to stop them and pleaded for help, but they kicked me and my child fell to the ground. Sakthivel could hardly talk but he signalled to me to leave with the child.тАЭ The police reportedly arrived two hours late, and directed Sakthivel and Theivanai to go home. By then Sakthivel was unconscious, and was pronounced dead by doctors at a nearby hospital. The village residents, however, contradicted the familyтАЩs versions of events. They claimed that Sakthivel was attacked for flashing at a woman. A police officer said the victim completely removed his jeans before defecating, reported The News Minute. тАЬA woman working on a site nearby saw him and thought he was flashing,тАЭ the officer added. тАЬWe are probing further.тАЭ Theivanai denied the allegations, and reiterated it was a caste attack. тАЬAfter the mob caught him, they checked his Aadhaar card and noted his caste name,тАЭ she claimed. тАЬWhile attacking him, they kept abusing him and calling out our caste name.тАЭ District Superintendent of Police D Jayakumar said there would be a detailed investigation to ascertain if there was a caste angle to the attack. тАЬHe died of heart attack due to the severe torture,тАЭ Jayakumar added. тАЬA case has been registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with Indian Penal Code Section 302 [punishment for murder].тАЭ",0,0,1,3
747,Dalit Youth Urges Supreme Court for Law to Block Quota Benefits for Kin of Legislators and Bureaucrats,"A view of the Supreme Court building. Bhopal/Mandsaur: A Dalit law student has appealed to the Supreme Court for legislation to stop family members of lawmakers and bureaucrats from getting the benefits of reservation. The development comes against the backdrop of a swirling debate on the quota system in the country, particularly after the SC ruled this month that there is no fundamental right to reservations in appointments and promotions under articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. The petitioner, 25-year-old Vikram Kumar Bagde, a native of Madhya PradeshтАЩs Neemuch town, is also of the view that just like people can voluntarily give up cooking gas and rail travel subsidy, the resourceful section of the reserved categories should have the option to forgo the benefits to ensure the 80% deprived community members can take much-needed advantage. Bagde, whose father is a peon, says he never availed caste reservation after clearing class XII, made it through the law entrance examination as a general category candidate, and is currently a first-year LLB student in Rajiv Gandhi College, Mandsaur. тАЬI had filed the PIL with the Supreme Court on January 25 and it was admitted on February 2,тАЭ said Bagde, adding that the date of hearing is yet to be finalised by the court. Explaining the reasons behind filing the public interest litigation, he said that children from affluent families are more likely to get selected in any entrance test or recruitment process owing to their well-funded preparations rather than someone from a less-privileged background. On this basis, he has urged the apex court to stop the kin of lawmakers and grade 1 government officers from availing the perks of reservation. Citing his interactions with several politicians in Madhya Pradesh, Bagde said eligible legislators could continue to take advantage of reservation provisions in elections but their family members should be prevented from doing it in education and jobs. The law student, who says he sees a dire need of reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but doesnтАЩt have much knowledge of quota provisions in his region, even tried surrendering his caste certificate but was purportedly told by several MPs and MLAs that no such clause exists. тАЬI have in my PIL urged the SC to ensure legislation to enable those who wish to shun reservation benefits on the lines of LPG subsidy and rail travel concessions,тАЭ said Bagde. He also argued that the race to grab reservation benefits is assuming dangerous proportions, triggering social tensions and divisions. тАЬInfluential people from within the reserved categories should lead by example,тАЭ Bagde said, maintaining that this would inspire others to give up quota benefits.",1,1,1,4
751,Did Gandhi and Ambedkar Share Similar Beliefs for Dalit Emancipation?,"The Discussion Map charts important debates from the pages of EтАЛPW. M K GandhiтАЩs approach to issues of caste-based exploitation and subordination has been critiqued and scrutinised by theorists and practitioners over the years. This scrutiny involves, in many instances, contrasting Gandhi and B R AmbedkarтАЩs approach to the question of Dalit emancipation. In 1996, Suhas Palshikar argued that while there are stark differences in the approach taken by Gandhi and Ambedkar, their shared goal of collective emancipation would require Gandhi to change his methodology. This is because, although Gandhi did not make caste-based inequality the centre of his struggles for emancipation, his views on the caste system reflected his тАЬultimate preparedness to abolish caste.тАЭ Anupama Rao responds to Palshikar and argues that the insight he provides into the beliefs and actions of the two thinkers reveals just how far apart their political methods and beliefs for emancipation were. A key differentiator was that AmbedkarтАЩs understanding of caste was grounded in lived experiences of violence, while GandhiтАЩs knowledge of caste was that of an abstract concept. Palshikar responds to Rao, arguing that his article attempted to build bridges between two rich discourses. Specifically, he believes that both Gandhi and Ambedkar saw Indian society as being composed of non-fragmented identities. Rao responds to Palshikar again and argues that, given the histories of domination and subordination of caste categories, they must not be depoliticised. Rather, caste divisions must be recognised and worked through, in order to achieve any form of unity.

806,14 forest officials booked for ├втВм╦Ьshooting dead├втВмтДв Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh,"The Shivpuri Police have registered a case against 14 forest officials for allegedly shooting dead a Dalit man, while his family filled water from a hand pump near a forest post, in the district on Sunday. The Forest Department claims that when a patrolling team reached a forest post at Fatehpur village near Karera, 50 km from Shivpuri, to remove an encroachment by the victim, Madan Mehtar, villagers pelted stones on them, prompting the firing of pellets. The victimтАЩs family alleges the officials fired at them during a scuffle that broke out over drawing water from a hand pump in the village. тАЬAn FIR (First Information Report) has been registered against ten identified persons and others who are unnamed,тАЭ said R.S. Chandel, Shivpuri Superintendent of Police. A case has been registered under Sections 302 [Punishment for murder], 307[Attempt to murder], 323 [Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt], 294 [Obscene acts], 147 [ Punishment for rioting.], 148 [Rioting, armed with deadly weapon], 149 [Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence commit┬нted in prosecution of common object] of the Indian Penal Code and section 3(2)(v) of the The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. No arrests have been made so far. The victimтАЩs father, Mahotam Mehtar, a permanent employee at the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri, had not received his salary for five-six months owing to absence from duty, though on medical grounds. This had led to a dispute with foresters, said Mr. Chandel. тАЬThe victim suffered more than 50 pellet wounds. A post mortem has been conducted on the body and we will get the report soon,тАЭ he said. The victimтАЩs wife Saroj Mehtar,28, gave an oral complaint to the police, based on which an FIR was registered. тАЬAround 2.30 p.m., along with mother-in-law and two daughters, she went to fetch water from the hand pump near the forest post like every day,тАЭ said the FIR. While one of the daughters washed utensils there, some water splashed on a forest Ranger nearby whoтАЩd come to fill a bottle. тАЬHe abused them and said - You lowly people, why do you come to fill water from the pump near the post?тАЭ When they protested against being abused, a female forest official allegedly slapped them. And one of the daughter called Mr. Madan and his brother Pankaj Mehtar from home, who were then hit by тАЬrifle butts and sticksтАЭ. As they attempted to run away, """"foresters fired at them from behind"""", injuring them. тАЬThe brother in law got injuries on his right shoulder. Mr. Madan died on the way to the hospital.тАЭ  This is the second reported incident of pellet gun firing by the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department in eight months. In July last year, during an eviction drive in Burhanpur district, officials reportedly fired pellets at tribals, injuring four. Meanwhile, Madhav National Park Director Mohan Meena, who has initiated an inquiry, said whether the guns belonged to the department or were privately owned was being looked into. тАЬThe patrolling team comprised of rangers, SDOs (Sub Divisional Officers), and two former Army soldiers who carried rifles,тАЭ he said. Mr. Meena alleged that villagers used country pistols and pelted stones on foresters as they approached the encroachment. As for drawing water from the pump, he said, тАЬAll arrangements are made before going out on a patrol. Officials carried water with them,тАЭ he claimed. Terming the incident an тАЬencounterтАЭ, Sudhir Kode, a Dalit activist, said, тАЬOfficials took law in their own hands. They fired unprompted, that too without permission.тАЭ Stating that the incident portrayed an attempt by upper castes to deny Dalits access to resources, including water, Ravi Mahant, an activist said, тАЬThose belonging to upper castes, even in uniform, fail to shed their identity to ensure equitable distribution of resources. No matter your position in power, caste prejudice persists.тАЭ Threatening to stage a dharna outside the Madhya Pradesh Chief MinisterтАЩs residence in Bhopal, Former Bhim Army State in-charge Sunil Astay wrote on Twitter, тАЬCanтАЩt Dalits even touch a hand pump now? The mountain of atrocities has broken loose on Dalits in Madhya PradeshтАж.

The member is Kameshwar Chaupal, the """"first kar sevak."""" Chaupal told BBC Hindi that he only learned of his inclusion in the trust upon Wednesday's announcement. Speaking on his appointment, Chaupal said, """"I think the Modi government has only included those who are deeply devoted to Hinduism, Hindutva and saint traditions."""" He said he wasn't appointed solely because he is a Dalit, but because of his advocacy for the temple from the get-go. Born on April 24, 1956, Chaupal hails from Bihar's Mithila region. In Hinduism, it is believed that the region was home to Goddess Sita, before she married the Hindu God Rama and moved to Ayodhya. Chaupal said that although Rama may be a God to the rest of the world, in Mithila, he is treated as a son-in-law, BBC reported. While pursuing a Master's degree from the Mithila University in Darbhanga, Chaupal joined the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) in 1984. The same year, the VHP organized a Hindu Sammelan at Delhi's Vigyan Bhavan. Chaupal participated in the conference. He said it was at the Hindu Sammelan that a nationwide public awareness campaign for the construction of a Ram temple was announced. Chaupal said that before the foundation stone for the Ram temple was laid in 1989, saints and religious leaders at a Kumbh Mela had decided that a Dalit would do the honor. VHP and RSS leaders settled on November 9, 1989, as the 'auspicious' date for shilanyas (laying of foundation stone). Chaupal was then the VHP joint general secretary in-charge of Bihar's tribal-dominated districts. """"Coincidentally, religious leaders invited me to lay the temple's first brick,"""" Chaupal told BBC. Speaking to News 18 in 2017 on the events of November 9, 1989, Chaupal recalled that he was not informed that he had been chosen to lay the temple's foundation until the last minute. Then-VHP leader Ashok Singhal's close aide Rameshwar reportedly informed Chaupal of his duties that very morning. Then aged 34, Chaupal laid the temple's first brick at the shilanyas site, close to where the Babri Mosque once stood. He was also sat beside Singhal at the ceremony. Chaupal told News 18, """"I could hardly comprehend what was happening. I was an ordinary worker, sitting with who's who of the Hindu religious leadership."""" In 1992, the mosque was demolished by kar sevaks. As he rose to prominence, Chaupal tried his hand at politics, contesting the 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on a BJP ticket. However, he lost. He then unsuccessfully contested the 1995 Bihar Assembly polls from Begusarai. In 2002, he was elected to the Bihar Legislative Council and served two terms. He also contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Supaul, but lost.  Want to share it with your friends too? Love India news? Subscribe to stay updated.",0,0,0,0

884,├втВм╦ЬReported as video went viral├втВмтДв: Rajasthan Dalit man violated with screwdriver,"The 23-year-old Dalit man from RajasthanтАЩs Nagaur district ,who was beaten up and violated with a petrol-laced screwdriver by a group of Rajputs, says the incident would have gone unreported had the video not leaked on social media sites because he wouldnтАЩt have dared to complain to the police . тАЬI would not have reported the incident to the police if the video had not gone viral. The Rajput men threatened me with dire consequences if I told anyone,тАЭ the man said about the incident Seven people -- the manager and six employees of a motorcycle service centre -- have been arrested in connection with the incident that took place on February 16, three days before the videos surfaced on social media. In the videos, two Dalits are seen being beaten with fan belts and one of them, the 23-year-old, is stripped and violated with a screwdriver. One of the accused filmed the torture on his mobile phone. The Nagaur incident has once again exposed the ugly reality of the deep caste divide that exists in Rajasthan and the fear of the upper castes that the Dalits live in despite promises by successive governments to protect them from oppression and ensure their emancipation. Rajasthan Police crime branch data show that incidents of violence against the Dalits increased 47.47% from 2018 to 2019. Kavita Srivastav, general secretary of the Rajasthan chapter of the PeopleтАЩs Union for Civil Liberties, says the Dalits continue to face caste violence and live in fear of the police. Another case in point is the April 2019 gang rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in front of her husband by five men who filmed the crime in RajasthanтАЩs Alwar and put it on social media. The rapists had waylaid the couple and beaten up the husband before taking turns to rape the woman. The victimтАЩs family said the local police did not register a case although a complaint was lodged on April 29. A case was finally registered on May 2 under the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after the video had gone viral and chief minister Ashok Gehlot issued an order that the first information report be registered in the offices of the superintendent of police. Nagaur district has the fifth highest number of cases of cruelty against Dalits in Rajasthan. According to police data, in 2019, Ganganagar and Bharatpur had the highest number of cases (408 each) followed by Hanumangarh with 311, Bikaner with 292, closely followed by Nagaur with 281. Additional director general of police (crime) BL Soni said the increase in the number of incidents of violence against Dalits in Rajasthan was a reflection of a liberal FIR registration policy adopted by the police. Former Rajasthan director general of police and current Congress MLA Harish Chandra Meena questioned this claim. He said he had to sit on a sit-in protest in Tonk district to get an FIR registered in the suspicious death of a lorry driver last year. Even in the Alwar gang rape case, no FIR was registered until the video of the incident had gone viral, he pointed out.. In the Nagaur incident, Satish Kumar of the Centre for Dalit Rights noted, the victimsтАЩ family said news of the incident had spread locally. тАЬIf people locally knew about the incident, was the police sleeping for three days,тАЭ he asked. The 23-year-old man who was beaten up and violated in the incident sat huddled in a two-room tenement on a sprawling 14-acre farm where the jeera crop was ready to harvest. His village, Sohan Nagar, is set in the sandy flatlands of Nagaurt, 350 km from the Rajasthan capital Jaipur. The victim and his cousin were assaulted in Karnu village where they had gone to get their bike serviced at the garage owned by a Rajput, Hanuman Singh, who is now in police custody. According to the accused, the cousins stole some money from the cash counter -- the reason why they were tortured . When the video went viral on February 19, the police had no option but to act. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose party governs Rajasthan, tweeted that the government should take prompt action. The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party dispatched delegations to the village to probe the incident. Rashtriya Loktantrik Party leader Hanuman Beniwal and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati attacked the Congress government. Politicians, Dalit rights activists, members of civil society organisations, media and the police all made a beeline to the remote village. The same day, the victims went to the Panchodi police station to file an FIR, and the police arrested the seven suspects within hours. Investigating officer Mukul Sharma said there had been no negligence by the police.On the video, he said: тАЬIt was the social media cell of the Nagaur police that intercepted the video on February 18 and informed us and we acted.тАЭ On the allegation that the torture victims had stolen money, Sharma said an FIR of theft had been filed against the cousins and the complaint was being investigated. He said the police had written to Facebook and other social media sites to remove the video from their platforms. Gautam Nayak, a lawyer, is blunt. тАЬThe SHO (station house officer) Rajpal Singh is a Rajput and the accused are Rajputs. He tried to shield them. We are demanding that he be suspended.тАЭ Satish Kumar of the Centre for Dalit Rights said the police had invoked mild provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the he Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, such as wrongful restraint, voluntarily causing hurt and unlawful assembly against the suspects. тАЬThey should have also put sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 120 (B) (punishment for criminal conspiracy), 326 (a) (punishment for acid attacks) of the IPC. Sections 3 (2) (giving false evidence) and section 3 (2) (iii) (committing mischief by fire or any explosive substance) of the SC/ST Act and sections 66 and 67 of the IT Act,тАЭ he said. PL Mimroth, founder of the Centre for Dalit Rights, said the law alone cannot do enough to prevent the recurrence of such violations. тАЬThe hold of the caste divide is perhaps a pointer to the fact that law alone cannot vanquish such social evils,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhy do certain castes feel emboldened to act in reprehensible ways,тАЭ he asked. тАЬThere is a need to change the mindset and sensitise the people.тАЭ Get our daily newsletter Get free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",0,0,1,3

The gruesome act, however, forced police to rush and file a case but only after a video made by the assaulters went viral on Wednesday. Seven people have been arrested in the case on the complaint of the Dalit youth in the presence of Deputy Superintendent of Police of Nagaur. Police identified the young victim as a resident of Karanu village under Panchauri police station area in the district. Those booked in the case are Bhim Singh, Aidan Singh, Asu Singh, Sawai Singh, Laxman Singh, Hanuman Singh and Ganpatram. As per the complaint, the accused thrashed the youth and pushed a cloth soaked in petrol into his rectum with the help of a screwdriver, severely injuring him.

897,"Once in Spotlight for Laying Foundation of Ram Temple, This Dalit Boy Has Now Been Nominated in Ayodhya Trust","Kameshwar Chaupal Meghnath Oram had travelled to Ayodhya with small jattha of karsewaks from South Bihar's Chota Nagpur division. Led by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) functionary in Gaya region, the group had camped about a mile off the disputed site. Oram since his arrival had shown signs of unrest. He had vowed to lay the foundation stone for a grand Ram temple at the site where Babri Masjid stood. Else, he would not return to his village. To avoid any untoward incident, Kameshwar Chaupal, the VHP joint general secretary in-charge of tribal-dominated districts in Bihar, was asked to keep a close watch on Oram. November 9, 1989 was the тАШauspiciousтАЩ day chosen by top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and VHP leaders to performs shilanyas and lay the foundation for the тАШproposed grand templeтАЩ at Ayodhya. It was to be the culmination of decade-long campaign led by the VHP and nurtured by the RSS. Early that Wednesday morning, VHP leader Ashok SinghalтАЩs close aide Rameshwar came looking for Chaupal. At the shilanyas site, very close to the disputed structure, Chaupal was accorded the coveted seat beside Singhal. Swami Chinmayananda, who would go on to become a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, was the master of the ceremony. With Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, seers and saints in attendance, the puja began. In a powerful political statement, from a bevy of gurus lined up for the event, the VHP had chosen a Dalit boy from Saharasa in Bihar to lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and of the BJP in national politics. Once Shilanyas was done, Kameshswar Chaupal left Ayodhya for his village in Bihar. On his arrival, Chaupal was told Baldev Jha, head of a prosperous Brahmin family had sent a message and wished to see him. тАЬWe had lived under centuries of subjugation, and I was reluctant. But my father coaxed me to go and meet Baldev Babu,тАЭ Chaupal recalled speaking to News18 in December, 2017. For a person who had never entered an Upper Caste household in his village, Chaupal was unsure of the reception he would receive. тАЬTo my shock, Baldev Babu held my hand, made me sit beside him and asked everyone in the family, young and old, to touch my feet. They had read about me in the newspapers,тАЭ he recalled. Chaupal later contested 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on BJP ticket, but lost. Chaupal tried his luck for the second time in 1995 Assembly polls. Five years later, he was nominated to the Bihar Legislative Council, where he served for two terms. Ahead of the 2014 general elections, JD(U) had broken its poll pact with the BJP. It asked him to contest from a general seat. Chaupal lost to Pappu YadavтАЩs wife and Congress candidate Ranjeet Ranjan. тАЛ",0,0,1,3

Citing the FIR, a senior police officer of Rajkot (rural) police said that the three accused went to the residence of the victim and kidnapped her after finding her alone. тАЬAs per the FIR, the three men took turns to rape the victim in the moving car.

935,Caste murder of Dalit man in TN: Govt told to pay Rs 25 lakh for inaction,"Despite multiple complaints alleging threat to life and property, the Thoothukudi police and district administration failed to take action to protect Arumugaraja, a Dalit farmer. The Tamil Nadu state government has been directed to pay a compensation of Rs 25,00,000 to the family of a Dalit man who was hacked to death by a gang in Thoothukudi district in 2015. Noting that the state had been willfully negligent, Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court also slammed the government and the police for inaction. Arumugaraja, a 45-year-old Dalit farmer from Srivaikuntam, had repeatedly complained about threats to his life from some dominant caste members of his village. However, despite an incident of Arumugaraja├в┬А┬Щs crops being set on fire, the police had not arrested the main accused. Justice SS Sundar observed that despite claims to the contrary, the state government and police department ├в┬А┬Ьhave not explained to the acceptance of this Court that they have strictly followed the procedure prescribed in law to its logical end to bring the peace and normalcy in the locality.├в┬А┬Э ├в┬А┬ЬHence, the murder was on account of recalcitrant attitude and the improper way of handling a serious complaint without considering the tension prevailed in the area by the police officials. The peace committee meeting was again an eye wash as it is stated by the petitioner.├в┬А┬Э said the court. It added, ├в┬А┬ЬA widow has lost her son, when she was 43 years and when she was in need of him for her protection and solace after the death of her husband. She had lost her hope in the State, who failed to give protection and she has to remain with a fear, which is painful.├в┬А┬Э The court also found that Arumugaraja was targeted not due to personal reasons but communal ones, for the dominant caste group to 'send a message.' Even as no protection was provided to Arumugaraja despite multiple requests, he was hacked to death in close proximity to the Srivaikuntam police station. Arumugaraja├в┬А┬Щs murder had caused tensions in the Navaladiar village at the time between the Dalits and the Maravar community. As far back as 2013, K Rukmani, Arumugaraja's mother, had alleged that the persons, who were posing a potential threat to her and her son, were neither summoned nor directed to appear before a court-ordered peace meeting. Moreover, the meeting itself was only an eyewash not to take action against the accused, the mother stated. Rukmini stated before the court that ├в┬А┬Ьdue to the wilful inaction on the part of the Government, particularly, the District Administration and the Superintendent of Police, Tuticorin emboldened the criminal elements to carry out their objectives.├в┬А┬Э Upholding this, the court said, ├в┬А┬ЬMishandling of the criminal complaint in 2013 has also paved way for the accused repeatedly threatening the life of [Rukmini] and her second son. The petitioner realised the seriousness of the situation prevailed not only at the time of giving complaint in 2013, but also subsequently.├в┬А┬Э Speaking to TNM, Robert Chandra Kumar, the lawyer for the family says that the verdict is a lesson to the state to not take complaints lightly. ├в┬А┬ЬThis is among the highest compensation awarded for the state├в┬А┬Щs negligence. This is in addition to and above the amount awarded for violation of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The crucial aspect is the court noting that the state is liable ├в┬А┬Ф that responsibility to provide protection has been emphasised,├в┬А┬Э says Robert. ┬й2021 the news minute",0,0,1,3
939,UP BJP MLA's son accused of assaulting Dalit employee,"UP BJP MLA's son accused of assaulting Dalit employee  Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Surendra Singh's son Hazari Singh has been accused of beating a Dalit employee. The incident took place on Wednesday and hundreds of tehsil office employees staged a demonstration at the police station demanding Hazari Singh's arrest. According to reports, Hazari Singh beat up the employee, Radhey Shyam, following a dispute over the choice of a particular booth level officer in Jamdharwa village. As the argument turned aggressive, Hazari Singh beat the employee. """"I tried to explain to him that the matter would be resolved in due course, but he and his half a dozen men beat me up. They slapped and kicked me when I fell down on the ground,"""" Radhey Shyam said. Hazari Singh, however, completely denied the incident and said that the concerned employee had misbehaved with them and had pushed one of his supporters. """"I simply intervened and then returned with my supporters while the employee went his way,"""" he said.

954,3 Dalit Men Accused of Stealing Donkeys Assaulted in Rajasthan; 5 People Arrested after Video Surfaces,"Representative image. Jaisalmer: Three Dalit youths were assaulted after being accused of stealing donkeys in Jaisalmer district, the third such incident to come to light in Rajsthan in recent days. Five persons have been arrested and three detained after a video of the incident surfaced, police said on Sunday. The incident occurred on February 15 in Rama village of Fatehgarh tehsil of the district. The youths were thrashed with sticks and kicked by nearly a dozen people for stealing donkeys. They were later handed over to Sangarh police. """"Five persons have been arrested and three minors have been detained so far. A case has been registered in the matter under sections of SC/ST Act and further investigation in the matter is on,"""" Station House Officer (SHO) of Sangarh police station Ugam Raj Soni said. Similar incidents had come to light in Nagaur and Barmer. A chilling video of a man being beaten up brutally in Barmer allegedly for committed a theft had gone viral here, prompting the police to arrest a man and detain another on Friday for their alleged roles in the crime. The video surfaced on Thursday close on the heels of brutal assault on two Dalit youths on similar allegation of theft in Nagaur. The Barmer incident occurred on January 29. Police have arrested at least seven persons in connection with the Nagaur case which occurred on February 16. The Dalit men were beaten up, stripped and tortured by staffers of a motorcycle service agency in Karanu village after accusing them of committing theft. In the video, a group of men is seen thrashing two persons with rubber belts. They later dipped a piece of cloth wrapped on a screwdriver in petrol and inserted it in the private parts of one of the victims. The incidents have triggered a political storm in Rajasthan with the BJP attacking the ruling Congress. Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has alleged that the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government is unable to rein in crime in Rajasthan. Meghwal, who is an MP from Bikaner, had accused the police of manipulating the Nagaur case.",0,0,1,4

Today, there are three broad, influential tre┬нnds in Dalit politics: First, there are fewer opportunities for Dalit political parties today because of the BJPтАЩs resurgence. In the 1990s, when Dalit parties came up, the Congress was declining and lots of small parties competed with each other; no one dominated. It is much easier for a small party to win a seat when voters spread their votes across five or six parties than just two or three. The 1990s were also the days of coalition governments.

986,"Dalit woman alleges gang rape by cops in Gorakhpur hotel, police denies charges","A 20-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly abducted and gang raped and assaulted by two policemen in a hotel room in UPтАЩs Gorakhpur on Thursday night. The police dismissed the charges, saying both the CCTV footage of hotel and the statement by hotelтАЩs guard makes it clear that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own, triggering public outrage with many slamming тАЬprotectors turning predatorsтАЭ in the chief ministerтАЩs own city. Following the public outrage over the incident and the pressure to act against culprits, an FIR into the incident was lodged at the Cantonment police station late on Friday night. Leaders of political parties including CongressтАЩs district president Nirmala Paswan, BSP workers led by district president Ghanshyam Rahi and BJP MLC Devendra Pratap Singh met the victim at the district hospital, where she was admitted after the incident. SSP Sunil Gupta said, тАЬYesterday, on February 14, a woman came to the district hospital and alleged that two policemen took her away on a bike and raped her in a hotel. The police acted swiftly on the complaint after which name of a hotel surfaced. During detailed investigation, the charges were found to be untrue. It came to the fore, on the basis of CCTV footage and the statement of hotelтАЩs guard that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own. So, prima facie, the matter seems to be suspicious. However an FIR has been lodged for further action.тАЭ According to reports, the incident occurred on Thursday night when the woman was returning home with her mother and elder sister on Thursday night at around 9pm on foot. According to the woman, as she walked ahead of her mother, two bike-borne policemen came and forced her to sit on their bike. When she resisted they threatened to frame her in a sex racket and assured that they will let her go after questioning at the police station. Instead of the police station, the duo took her to a hotel room, forced her to consume alcohol and then raped her taking turns. They also beat her up and gave her Rs 600 while threatening her not to open her mouth. On returning home late at night, she narrated her ordeal to her mother.

1023,Dalit Woman Dies After Being Set On Fire By Neighbour In Maharashtra,"During a quarrel, the neighbour poured kerosene on the woman and set her on fire (Representational) A 50-year old Dalit woman, who was set on fire by a neighbour after she resisted his move to enter her house in Maharashtra's Aurangabad, has died, a doctor said on Thursday. The woman, who suffered about 95 per cent burns in the incident that took place in Andhari village of Sillod tehsil on Sunday midnight, was undergoing treatment at a government medical college and hospital in Aurangabad city. """"She died around 10 pm on Wednesday,"""" the hospital's medical superintendent Suresh Harbade told news agency PTI. The accused, Santosh Mohite (50), who knew the woman as he stayed in her neighbourhood in Andhari village, was arrested on Tuesday, a police official said. As per the woman's statement given to police before death, she tried to push Mohite out of her house, but in vain. This led to a quarrel between them following which Mohite set her ablaze, Sillod (rural) police station's inspector Kiran Bidve said. """"The victim and the accused knew each other and he used to come to her house. But, on Sunday when he came around midnight, the woman opposed it saying their meeting at that hour would defame her,"""" he said. However, despite her opposition, Mohite entered her house and they had a fight, he said. """"During the quarrel, Mohite poured kerosene kept nearby on the woman and set her afire,"""" he added. The accused later locked the door from outside and ran away, the police said. On hearing the woman's screams, some of her relatives staying in the vicinity rushed to the place and took her to a local hospital, from where she was referred to the government hospital in Aurangabad city. The accused was earlier booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code or IPC for an attempt to murder, voluntarily causing hurt, house-trespass with preparation for causing hurt to any person intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, Mr Bidve said. He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the official said. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jaleel demanded that the case be tried in a fast-track court for ensuring justice to the victim and her family.  The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader said he has demanded in Parliament that hearing be conducted in fast-track court in this case and that of a woman set on fire in Wardha district. A 25-year-old lecturer was set ablaze by a stalker in Wardha on Monday, leaving her critically injured. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world.

1040,"Ram mandir trust to be autonomous; to have 15 members, including a dalit: Shah","Former BJP ally Shiv Sena welcomes formation of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra The trust to be set up by the Centre to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya's disputed land will be autonomous and will comprise 15 trustees, of which one will be a dalit. """"There will be 15 trustees in Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from Dalit society,"""" tweeted Union Home Minister Amit Shah as he thanked PM Narendra Modi for the decision. The trust will also be an independent body, capable of taking all decisions regarding the construction of the temple, said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. """"Thank you to Modiji for setting up an autonomous trust to build a grand temple at the birthplace of Lord Shri Ram.The 'Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra' trust will be completely independent and capable of taking all decisions related to temple construction. Jai Shree Ram!"""" Adityanath tweeted thanking the Narendra Modi government for taking a step closer to building the temple. The Centre's decision regarding Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra trust was announced by PM Modi in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. Announcing the trust, PM Modi said the trust will take over the disputed 67.703 acres of land and has an inside and outside courtyard. He also informed the Uttar Pradesh government has given its approval for 5 acres to be alloted to Sunni Waqf Board, as ordered by the Supreme Court. Ending a more than two decade-long land dispute in Ayodhya's Ram Janmanbhoomi, the apex court had on November 9 last year ordered that the disputed land at Ayodhya must be given to a trust for construction of a Ram temple and ordered the Central government to formulate a scheme within three months. The three-month deadline was nearing its deadline on February 9. However, the Congress has questioned the timing of the announcement, linking it to the forthcoming Delhi assembly elections. Interestingly, the Shiv Sena, BJP former ally in Maharashtra, was one of the first parties to respond to the setting up of the trust. It welcomed the Modi government's decision. The Shiv Sena is currently a Congress-NCP ally in Maharashtra where it is running a government with Udhhav Thackeray as the chief minister. Copyright ┬й 2021 All rights reserved",0,0,0,0

1125,Dalit children drop out of school due to poverty,"Wednesday, 08 September 2021 08:59 PM Published On: February 6, 2020 12:12 PM NPT By: Janak KC  JAJARKOT, Feb 6: Suraj Nepali's dream to sit for the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) is shattered for this year. Next year, he will try his luck once again. It is not because he was not prepared for the papers. A student of Tribhuvan Secondary School of Khalanga, he actually couldn't make it to the 10th grade even after getting through the 9th grade as he could not pay the admission fees of Rs 930 on time. """"I did not have that much money in hand so I could not get admitted to the 10th grade, and then I stopped going to the school. Now when others are going to sit for SEE, I am feeling bad,"""" he said. """"I will try next year,"""" he added. His younger sister Anita also dropped out of school last year. She passed the 5th grade from Narajyoti Primary School and she also needed to pay Rs 930 to get into the next class. This was not paid and she stopped going to school. Instead, she is seen busy grinding stones with her mother near a riverbank. She also goes out to graze cows. """"I did not have money for the admission fees. Mother could not manage it either, so I stayed at home,"""" she said. """"May be next year, it will get a little comfortable, even I am working and earning,"""" she added. It is not just Suraj and Anita, their younger sister Gita has been deprived of education too. After failing to pay the admission fees and manage other expenses, Gita also stopped going to school from last year. """"I love to go to school, but I am not going there these days. I go with my mother and work,"""" she said. She was also a 6th grader, studying with her sister. The children's father Bir Bahadur Nepali died four years ago in Ramgadh in India in a fire accident. A local of Gangatiya village of Bheri Municipality тАУ 6, he had left for India after settling family in the district headquarters for the children's education. But after his demise, things turned worse for his wife and children. The couple has six children. None of them go to school currently. According to Nirmala, the children's mother, the living expense in the headquarters is too high and the family faces the question of survival. In such a situation, educating children is challenging. """"It is not just about the admission fees. Uniform, books, stationery and other expenses - I don't have money to afford all that,"""" she said. """"I work the whole day and the pay is not enough even to feed my kids properly,"""" she lamented. The family has a small cottage to live in, a small plot of land in the backyard and a pair of old cows. According to Nirmala, her children can go to school only if somebody extends support. Vice principal of Tribhuvan Secondary School of Khalanga, Haribahadur Basnet stated that Dalit students could be considered for lesser amount of admission fees. But the family has not notified it to the school, he said. """"For the extremely poor, the school can make some considerations. But they have to fill the form accordingly. We have not been formally informed of this,"""" he claimed. Meanwhile, Dal Bahadur Gharti, administrative officer at Bheri Municipality, expressed concern over the fee provisions. Schools cannot compel the students to pay fees up to the secondary level, he said. """"Moreover, they are Dalits. In case of Dalits, schools should be even more sensitive,"""" he said, adding that the school administrations would be quizzed about it. The constitution guarantees right to education for every child in the country. For Dalit and needy kids, the government is supposed to offer residential facilities for his or her smooth schooling. However, many children in the country hit by extreme poverty continue to drop out before completing their secondary level education.

Kalyan Singh was Uttar Pradesh chief minister when the Babri mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992. His government was dismissed hours after the demolition and Singh was sent to jail for a day for contempt of court since he had given an undertaking that he would protect the mosque. Singh later admitted that he had given orders that no firing should be done on the тАШKar SevaksтАЩ in Ayodhya. Meanwhile, another BJP leader Uma Bharti, also former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, told a news channel in Bhopal that she backed Kalyan SinghтАЩs demand. тАЬI am with Kalyan Singh on this because many OBCs, including me, were at the forefront of the Ayodhya Ram Temple movement.

1276,"Delhi Assembly polls: Rallies by Gandhi family to focus on Dalit, Muslim, Purvanchal voters","The top leaders of Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, will hold rallies for the campaign in Delhi Assembly elections with a focus to cover Dalit, Purvanchal and minority voters, party sources said. The Congress, which is running at a slow pace in the campaigning for the Delhi Assembly polls, has planned meetings of its top leadership as part of a strategy to give an edge to the campaign in the last phase and bring back its old vote bank. Five rallies of the Gandhi family will be held in Delhi in two days. The party's interim president Sonia Gandhi will address a rally in East Delhi. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are expected to address four rallies jointly. On February 5, Sonia Gandhi's rally will be held at Shastri Park in East Delhi, in which the Muslim vote will be in a decisive position. Seelampur and Gandhinagar Assembly constituencies are directly connected with Shastri Park, while adjoining seats like Babarpur, Mustafabad, Karaval Nagar are crucial in terms of Muslim votes. On February 5, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will address a rally at the Muslim-dominated Old Delhi's Haus Qazi area, around which there are seats like Matia Mahal, Ballimaran, Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar where Muslim voters are more than 20 per cent. The politics in these Muslim dominated areas are mainly on issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Congress has put its stand against the CAA and NRC very strongly in their manifesto too. The party hopes that it will get the sympathy of Muslim voters in the Delhi elections. Both the leaders will also hold a meeting in the Kondli area of East Delhi to reach out to the Dalit vote bank. While Kondli is a Scheduled Caste (SC) reserved constituency, the Trilokpuri and Seemapuri seats adjacent to it are also reserved for the SC. Their meeting in Kondli will be on February 5. On February 4, Rahul and Priyanka will address a meeting at Sangam Vihar in South Delhi, which is a Purvanchali-dominated seat. From this seat, Poonam Jha Azad, wife of Kirti Jha Azad, the head of the campaign committee of Delhi Congress, is contesting. Kirti Azad has been Projected as Purvanchali face in Delhi by the Congress. Apparently, campaigning for his wife can be seen as an attempt to give a message to the Purvanchali voters across Delhi. It is also important here that along with Sangam Vihar, seats like Deoli and Ambedkar Nagar are adjacent, which are in the reserved category. Apart from this, on February 4, the two leaders will seek votes for the Congress' prominent Sikh leader Tarvinder Marwah from Jangpura seat. Campaigning in Delhi will end on February 6 and voting will be done on February 8. (ANI) (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

1322,Ram Mandir Trust row: Dalit leaders contemplating filing PIL,"Nasinghpur : Two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced formation of a trust for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the matter has stirred up controversy after Madhya Pradesh-based seer Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, who has been a part of the decades-old temple movement, took umbrage at the exclusion of his name from the panel.  Swaroopanand Saraswati's disciple Avimukteshwaranand on Friday also threatened to move the court if the government doesn't make any amendments.  Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati of Sharda Peeth and Jyotishpeeth here has objected to inclusion of Vasudevanand Saraswati who has been named as the Shankaracharya of Jyotish peeth, while the Supreme Court has earlier recognised Swaroopanand as the Shankaracharya of the Jyotish peeth.  In a statement, Swaroopanand Saraswati said: """"I am the Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth. The Prime Minister by nominating another person as Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth has disobeyed the Supreme Court which even refused to consider Vasudevanand a sanyasi.  The seer who is based in this Madhya Pradesh town said that the Supreme Court has in four rulings refused to acknowledge Vasudevanand as Shankaracharya.  """"If Shankaracharya was really to be associated with the trust he should have been named to preside over the trust instead of Parasaran, the advocate for Ramjanmabhoomi land case.  He has been made the office of the chairman of the trust and his residence. Parasaran is a senior advocate of the country and a Jusrist of repute... The government seems to be keen to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya as per the secular constitution and not according to Vedic provisions,"""" he said in a statement.  Shankaracharya said a Ramalaya Trust was formed in the 1990s for the construction of Ram temple in the conference of the four Shankaracharyas, which included other representatives including Shankaracharyas, Vaishnavacharyas, representatives of the Akharas.  This trust was built for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya but the Central government has ignored a working trust while setting up a new trust, he said.  Swami Swaroopanand said a Scheduled Caste person included in the trust belongs to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Besides, some officials have been appointed by the government, in gross violation of the Constitution. Any trust that includes a government functionary who cannot be responsible for the construction of a shrine, he contended.  Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharati, who belongs to the Lodhi caste wants an OBC member in the trust.

1325,Dalit youth attacked with trident for not washing hands,"Ballia (Uttar Pradesh), Feb 17 (IANS): A Dalit youth was attacked with a trident by four youths for touching food without washing his hands in Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district. The incident took place in the Dokati village on Saturday night where a 'bhandara' (community feast) was being held and the entire village was invited to the function. Upendra Ram, 30, who works in a coal shop, came to the function straight from the shop, and had coal stains on his hands. As soon as he picked up the food for himself, the four youths objected to his picking up the food without washing his hands. A verbal spat soon turned ugly and the youth attacked him with hot tongs.  As Ram fell to the ground, one of the youths picked up a trident and attacked him with it. Ram has been admitted to a hospital in a critical condition. The police are yet to register a case and arrest the accused. A police official said that no complaint had been filed in the matter. CM Aditya Bisht is relaxing after Delhi election campaign. After that, he has to prepare for high power Bihar election! CM Yogi's model of cleanliness and administration... India has to go a long way to abolish untouchability like rampant evil practices. Attacking dalit or anyone for no fault is grave crime!Evil practices such as racial abuses are prevalent in developed countries as well but to a far lesser level.It's moral duty of all of us, our society, political parties and Govt to continuously educate the masses against such practices and take stringent deterrent actions on the perpetrators to prevent occurrence of such evil practices. Frustrated by vedic culture the Dravidian Bassvsnna stood against social practices before 900 years back And at present Dravidian are attacked frequently. Periyar also social reform er from Dravidian and both are from Karnataka While Corona virus has become an international threat, washing your hands is important! I sometimes wonder, with so many centuries of boasting of Sanatana Dharma, why no one has tried to eradicate this untouchability.Whenever Hindu Jagarana Vedike holds Hindu Sammelana, they say 'Navella Hindu, Navella Ondu' but in reality the lower castes in Hindus know that they will never be one.

1382,IIT Madras Under Fire For Casteism After Shutting Off Gate Leading To Dalit Community,"CHENNAI, Tamil Nadu тАФ On Christmas last year, the administration of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, or IIT-M, boarded up a narrow gate to the instituteтАЩs sprawling 630-acre campus triggering a protest that has revived persistent conversation about caste, privilege, and the debt that IndiaтАЩs premier public-funded engineering institutions owe to their neighbouring communities. Krishna Gate, as the entrance that serves as a conduit between IIT-M and Velachery is called, was closed by the IIT-M administration on December 25 2019. In a subsequent email, IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthy claimed the gate was shut due to a тАЬheightened security threatтАЭ from тАЬundesirable elementsтАЭ who hangout near the gate, and to prevent the sale of тАЬbanned substancesтАЭ and тАЬassault on womenтАЭ students. The residents of Velachery, many of whom are Adi Dravidar Dalits, see the closure of the gate as the betrayal of a 60-year-old agreement between IIT-M and their ancestors whose lands were acquired for the instituteтАЩs campus, and a clear instance of caste-based discrimination. Protests against the closure of the gate have acquired such momentum that the matter was recently raised on the floor of Tamil NaduтАЩs Legislative Assembly. Residents say the Adi Dravidar community lost at least 76 acres of land in the deal that was struck after deliberations between the sarpanchs of Velachery, Taramani, and Kanagam on the one hand, and K Kamaraj, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. A Lakshmanaswamy, the first chairman of the IIT board of governors, and Dr. B Sengupto the first director of IIT-Madras. In return for their lands, residents were promised access to the campus through Krishna gate, employment on campus and the right to worship at their temple, Peeliamman Kovil which also fell on IIT lands after the acquisition. Over the next decades, children born in the area were also promised preferential enrollment in schools located inside the campus, residents said, adding that close to 500 students from the locality now study at the Vanavani and Kendriya Vidyalaya schools on campus. The sudden and arbitrary closure of the gate has broken this decades-long pact, prompting the question of how institutions like the IITs see their place in Indian society: As open campuses fostering a culture of engagement; or as elite, isolated enclaves where nerdy students prep feverishly for high-paying corporate jobs, while justifying their publicly subsidised education under the guise of nation-building. тАЬWho are they to stop us?тАЭ asked Manimaran, a resident of Velachary at a public meeting held on January 19 under a tamarind tree close to the now-shuttered Krishna Gate. тАЬUnder this tamarind tree generations of our people have been gathering to settle issues of the community,тАЭ Manimaran continued. тАЬThis land belongs to us and we gave them some of it for development. We will reclaim the gate and our right to enter IIT no matter what.тАЭ Residents said the administration only seems to have perceived a threat to student safety from Krishna Gate тАФ which opens out into a predominantly Dalit settlement. Taramani Gate, which opens out into a Brahmin and Other Backward Classes neighbourhood, had been kept open. тАЬScheduled Caste people live in this area. By issuing the explanation about тАЬundesirable elementsтАЭ, the IIT director has wounded us. This is an insult,тАЭ said K. Rajendran, a retired IIT-Madras employee who got a job because his mother gave up her land for the institute. Assistant Commissioner of Police PK Ravi confirmed that the police had recently arrested a few men selling marijuana near Krishna gate, but added the problem wasnтАЩt restricted to a particular community or neighbourhood. тАЬWe had arrested some anti-social elements who were peddling banned substances near the Krishna gate six months ago,тАЭ Ravi said. тАЬThe problem persists even near Taramani gate of the instituteтАЭ. Thol Thirumavalavan, the Member of Parliament for Chidambaram constituency too had made his concerns explicit in a letter to the IIT administration. тАЬWhile all gates including those designated for other communities are open and accessible, the IIT management has shut the gate for Adi Dravidar people with the ill intention of untouchability,тАЭ Thirumavalavan said. тАЬThis act has not only destroyed the livelihood of AD people but it is also unlawful caste discriminationтАЭ. V. Prabhu was six years old when his familyтАЩs lands were acquired by IIT-Madras in 1959. тАЬWe used to live where the womenтАЩs hostels now stand,тАЭ said Prabhu, who is now 60. The family had 11 cows and used to supply milk to nearby households, and also ran a cycle stand with 21 bicycles that they rented out to residents. When their land was acquired, Prabhu said, the family faced hard times. Initially, there was little demand for milk as the land had been cleared, and only a few IIT officers, staff and students were on campus; the cycle business shut down as well. The family eagerly awaited the promised jobs on campus. But few, if any promises of jobs, employment and development were coded into the land acquisition contracts signed with the villagers in 1959. The only land acquisition document that villagers could share with HuffPost India, lists 27 names of owners most of whom had sold the land where their тАЬhutsтАЭ once stood. They were paid government land rates ranging between Rs. 6 to Rs. 65. The document signed on 2 December 1964 by a Revenue Division Officer, also notes that the government had paid a total of Rs. 672.50 to 27 families at the time. In 1972, Prabhu was offered a temporary job in the electricity and maintenance wing but he soon quit because the pay was too low. тАЬI took up business and started earning better,тАЭ he said. His children, now in their 20s, had studied in IIT-MтАЩs Vanavani school in their teens by availing the preferential admission process which has since been phased out. As PrabhuтАЩs business picked up, he moved out of Velachery. So why was he still part of the Krishna gate protests? тАЬWhen my father was alive, he used to go for walks into the IIT campus. He used to fight security personnel if they stopped him because he was convinced that he still had claim over the land which the government took,тАЭ Prabhu said. тАЬOur sweat and blood is part of this land. The closure has hurt the pride of all our people.тАЭ In this context, the closure of the Krishna gate appears to have triggered deep social memories of exclusion. Since the gate was shut in December 2019, the only way to reach Velachary from campus is via a 3 km detour. As a consequence, several small shops and businesses set up to cater to IITтАЩs student population have suffered: Photocopy centres, eateries, bike repair shops and even the local housing market. S. Kumareshan, a mechanic, said he has been out of work for three weeks. тАЬThe owner of the bike repair shop is thinking of taking his business elsewhere if the gate remains shut,тАЭ Kumareshan said. Students who have rented apartments in the vicinity too may move out soon, landowners said, expressing fear over a drop in rent rates and real estate prices. Retired IIT employees who have been using banking and medical services on campus are hit by the gate closure because they are now forced to travel much further to avail the facilities, residents said. тАЬI am a heart patient,тАЭ said Rajendran, the former IIT employee. тАЬIf I suffer cardiac arrest or any other ailment I will now be forced to go to a private hospital located about six kilometres away instead of availing the pensionerтАЩs medical health benefits at the IIT hospitalтАЭ. тАЬтАЬIITs were conceived with a vision to mould engineers and researchers who could contribute to the process of nation building... The move to isolate us from the population outside is in direct conflict with this goalтАЭ.тАЭ Women students for Krishna gate The decision to close Krishna gate, IITтАЩs administration has claimed, was partly out of concerns for the safety of women students. Yet the instituteтАЩs women students appear unconvinced. 1,500 students тАФ many of them women тАФ have submitted a petition to the IIT administration demanding that the gate be reopened. тАЬThe director is misleading the public,тАЭ said K. Fabitha, a research associate at IIT-Madras who has participated in the protests. тАЬI have been using the gate to go back home late at night. I have never come across the presence of any unsafe elements there.тАЭ While the IIT administration had claimed that a woman student was assaulted near Krishna gate, Fabitha said the assault had actually occurred elsewhere. The Krishna gate, she said, served as a vital conduit between the institute and the Velachery neighbourhood. тАЬThere is an emotional connection with the people and the place near Krishna gate,тАЭ Fabitha said. тАЬThey have always been a good memory attached to life in the institute. We could never differentiate between тАШusтАЩ and тАШthemтАЩтАЭ. тАЬIITs were conceived with a vision to mould engineers and researchers who could contribute to the process of nation-building,тАЭ said a member of ChintaBAR, an independent student body in IIT Madras, seeking anonymity as they feared they might be targeted by the administration. тАЬThe move to isolate us from the population outside is in direct conflict with this goalтАЭ.

Twitter user Kanha advised him to undergo a mental treatment.  Some people even tagged the Prime Minister's office to complain about the provocative comment by Udit Raj. Twitter user Kraturpa slammed the BJP leader and raised the issue with the BCCI and PM Modi.  Only a few days ago, the BJP MP had sought reservation in cricket for dalits, a demand that the BCCI rubbished. Raj had alleged that there is discrimination in the selection process in BCCI. Dr. Udit Raj, discusses the issue with Vinod Kambli and gets affirmation that there is discrimination in the selection process in BCCI. pic.twitter.com/tp2trP7By8 Many people are of the view that the BJP MP is making such statements with Uttar Pradesh election in mind, where Dalit and OBCs comprise a sizeable portion of the electorate and the party has been unable to make inroads in these constituencies.

Sakthivel tied up by the mob. Photo: Video screengrab New Delhi: A 24-year-old Dalit man was beaten to death in Tamil Nadu after he was found squatting on the roadside to relieve himself. Police have arrested seven people, four men and three women, on Friday after videos of the torture of the youth, R. Sakthivel, surfaced on social media. The incident had taken place on Wednesday. SakthivelтАЩs elder sister, R. Theivanai, told Indian Express that her brother was тАЬattacked only because he was a DalitтАЭ. Quoting a police officer, the paper said that the village where Sakthivel was attacked was dominated by Vanniyars, which falls under Other Backward Class (OBC) category in the state. The victim belongs to the Scheduled Caste Adi Dravida community. Recounting the sequence of events, Theivanai narrates that Sakthivel had received a call from colleagues at the petrol pump on Wednesday to reach with his Aadhaar card and photo for official verification. As he was leaving home around 1:30 pm, he told his sister that there was hardly any fuel in his two-wheeler. A little later, Sakthivel called to say that he had run out of petrol. тАЬHe said he would try to push the bike for a kilometre or two and that he had asked a friend to get petrol in a bottle. But just before he hung up, he said he had a pain in his stomach and that he had been feeling the urge to defecate for a while. He said he would sit by the roadside,тАЭ Theivanai told Express. After some time, Theivanai got a call from her brotherтАЩs phone number. тАЬтАжI asked if he had reached his office. But there was a different voice at the other end. The man said they had tied Sakthivel up and that he was in their custody. He asked me to reach Boothur Hills (about 5 km from their home). It was clear there was some problem,тАЭ she said. She got a ride on a relativeтАЩs two-wheeler and rushed to the spot, carrying her six-month-old baby. тАЬWhen we reached, Sakthivel was bleeding profusely from his mouth and nose and some 15-20 people had gathered around him. When I reached, they beat him some more. I tried to stop them and pleaded for help, but they kicked me and my child fell to the ground. Sakthivel could hardly talk but he signalled for me to leave with the child,тАЭ she said. Also read: Weeks After Rape and Murder of Dalit Woman, Modasa Case Still Shrouded in Mystery The police reached the venue about two hours after Sakthivel was tied up and asked the sister-brother duo to go home.

However, when they got home on the two-wheeler, Sakthivel dropped to the ground. тАЬHe was unconscious all along but we didnтАЩt know that he was dead. Later, doctors at the nearby hospital said he had been brought dead,тАЭ she said. Indian Express also reported that there was accusation that Sakthivel had тАШflashedтАЩ a woman. A senior police officer said that since the victim had removed his jeans fully before squatting, a woman working at site nearby thought he was flashing. тАЬWe are probing further,тАЭ he said. Theivanai strongly refuted the accusation and noted that the mob was constantly referring to his caste. тАЬHe dropped out after Class 10 and started working when he was very young. He got me and my younger sister married. Earlier, he used to carry huge cement sacks to make a living. After the mob caught him, they checked his Aadhaar card and noted his caste name.

The elder son is seven years old while the younger is one and a half years old. Dinesh Kumar Khatik was one of the individuals killed in anti-Hindu riots in Delhi. OpIndia had a conversation with Dinesh Kumar KhatikтАЩs brother Suresh and he clearly said that his brotherтАЩs life has been taken by jihad тАУ the jihad of Islamic fundamentalists. He said that the whole of Mustafabad killed his brother. By Mustafabad, he meant a Muslim dominated area. This is how the gruesome murder unfolded. Dinesh Kumar Khatik is survived by his wife and two children. The elder son is seven years old while the younger is one and a half years old. He had gone to get milk for his two children on the 26th of February and due to the closure of shops, he had to go farther. During this, he passed by the school of Faisal Farooq. While he was passing by, the riotous Muslim mob was rampaging through the streets with petrol bombs along with firing and stone-pelting. Just then, a bullet from the rioters hit DineshтАЩs head and he passed away. Advocate Monica Arora has also approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide compensation and justice to the victimтАЩs family. When OpIndia team reached the house of the deceased Dinesh, the atmosphere there was very turbid. There were some people who were taking note of the statements of the victims. They were referring to themselves as a committee of the court. Talking to them, Suresh said that his only demand from the government is that every madarsa and mosque should be searched so that the Muslim mobs cannot store dangerous weapons from now on. Suresh also reiterated this during a conversation with OpIndia. Others present there told OpIndia that bullets had been shot in the head, eyes and neck of the victimized Hindus. They told that weapons made of iron were stored and kept, with which the heads of Hindus were being attacked. People are still scared. The people of Prem Nagar and Prem Vihar, while narrating their grief to us, told us that their trust has been lost from the police administration.

1590,"We were told non-violence is cowardly: Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a Dalit activist who quit the RSS"," In late 1980s, Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a 13-year-old from the Dalit community, started attending the Rashtriya Swayamsewak SanghтАЩs shakhas in Rajasthan, without knowing much about the organisation. Over the course of around four years, Meghwanshi grew to harbour a visceral hatred for Muslims and began to take immense pride in his Hindu identity. He dedicated himself to the cause of the RSSтАЩs Hindu Rashtra, even receiving military training by the organisation. But after facing discrimination within the RSS, he realised that its vision is different for caste Hindus and Dalits. Meghwanshi is now a journalist and an activist. His book Main Ek Karsevak ThaтАФI Was a KarsevakтАФwas first published in Hindi in 2019 and its English translation, I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, was published by Navayana in January this year. That month, Sushil Kumar, an independent journalist, spoke to Meghwanshi about the RSSтАЩs process of indoctrinating its cadre, its glorification of violence and its vision for a Hindu Rashtra. Sushil Kumar: In which period were you in the RSS?Bhanwar Meghwanshi: I was active from 1987 to 1991. I participated in the first тАЬkarasevaтАЭ of 1990. I had left home to dismantle the Babri Masjid [in Uttar PradeshтАЩs Ayodhya], but did not reach, as the [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam SinghтАЩs government was in power. At that time, we used to call him тАЬMulla-yamтАЭ Singh, meaning тАЬmaulana Mulayam.тАЭ His government arrested me, near the Tundla station, and kept me in the Agra jail for some ten days. By then, whatever karaseva had to take place had taken place. Then I returned home. SK: Were there any women at the shakha?BM: At the shakha, all were men. We talked only about purusharth, male dominance. It is evident that there was no place for women. Seen one way, the meaning of purushartha is masculinity, patriarchy. SK: What did you learn during your time as a swayamsevak?BM: I got to learn many things. First thing, I evidently became a reactionary. The second thing I learnt was to imagine everyone who was not from my village and panchayat as an enemy, and fight them, defeat them and hate them. Sushil Kumar is an independent journalist.

1604,Ambedkar Statue Issue: Dalit refuse to burry upper-caste Hindu,"Hyderabad: In State Of Telangana there is a remote village named Podduturu under Shankarpalli Mandal, Rangareddy District. On March 18, there was a very unusual scenario in this village. A person belonging to a higher caste(Reddy community) passed away. There was an unusual delay in the final death rituals. When enquired it came to know that the Dalits of the village rejected to be part of death rituals like doing all odd works for the dead and playing band in the death possession. No Dalit came forward in the entire village to take up the job. Finally, all the odd jobs even playing off the death band was done by the upper class (Reddy community). This strong rejection from Dalit community was in response to the higher community rejecting the installation of Babasaheb Ambedkar Statue in front of the panchayat office in the village. The Dalits of the village wanted to install the statue of Babasaheb in the open land in front of the panchayat office and they requested for the permission for the same. But the village sarpanch belonging to higher caste (reddy) opposed it. He said he will get permission to install statues of Shivaji Maharaj or Swami Vivekananda but he will not let them install a statue of Babasaheb. Retaliating to this the Dalits called for a Dalit community meeting on 18 March morning. Dalit community heads decided Dalits of the village will not work for any upper caste. The Dalits will lead a free and dignified life. Nobody can force them to work the way they used to for centuries. It was unanimously decided that Dalits will not play bands on deaths or on marriages of the higher community as per custom. Dalit leaders Mr.K. Ramu, Mr. K Katagiri, Mr. G Vijay, Mr. K lachayya, Mr. Malesham, Mr. Laxman and Mr. K Prasad said that this decision of the community will be strictly followed and if any Dalit found violating this unanimous decision of this community then he/she will be dealt very strictly and they will be thrown out of the community along with their family and near relations. A similar rejection of the upper community by Dalits took place in a remote village named Ramadugu Karimnagar. Here Dalit community also decided that they will not take up any odd job offered by upper caste. They will lead to dignified life breaking centuries-old customs. In this village, Dalits are not playing dead bands or marriage bands either. Get the news updates on WhatsApp & Telegram by subscribing to our channels.

1605,"STs, Dalits and Muslims Poorest in India, Not Just Financially: UN Report - Clarion India","Clarion India NEW DELHI тАФ Every second person belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and every third person belonging to the Scheduled Castes remains poor in India. Similarly, every third Muslim is multi-dimensionally poor as are two in five children under the age of 10, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)тАЩs global multidimensional poverty index (MPI), 2018. The term multidimensional means poor not only on the basis of income but on other indicators such as nutrition, health, education, living standards and assets, this is how the report released on Thursday mentioned. The report found that 50 per cent of all tribals in the country are poor as are 33 per cent of Dalits and 33 per cent of Muslims. Overall, India still has the largest number of people living in multidimensional poverty in the world at 364 million or around 27 per cent of the countryтАЩs population. Of this, as many as 34.5 per cent are children. Moreover, 8.6 per cent of the countryтАЩs population lives in тАЬsevere povertyтАЭ, according to the report. The report ranks India as having the largest number of poor in absolute numbers on account of its population, while in terms of the proportion of poor, India is the 54th poorest country among the 105 surveyed. Niger tops this list. The report reflects how IndiaтАЩs most vulnerable sections continue to remain at the bottom of the pyramid. On the other hand, report finds that the so-called upper castes fare far better on the MPI scale тАФ only 15 per cent of the тАШupperтАЩ castes are poor. The positive indicator in the report is that the poverty rate in India has gone down significantly in the 10 years тАФ from 55 per cent in 2005-06 to 28 per cent in 2015-16. According to the report, the poorest groups тАФ spanning across states, castes, religions and age groups тАФ have had the highest reduction in MPI during 2005-06 and 2015-16. For instance, while 80 per cent of the Scheduled Tribe had been poor in 2005-06, the figure has gone down to 50 per cent in 2015-16, says the report. State-wise, Bihar, followed by Jharkhand, are the poorest states with 52 per cent and 45 per cent of their population respectively identified as living in multidimensional poverty. In Kerala, which is the best performer, only 1 per cent of population falls in the category. The causes of multidimensional poverty across states seem consistent тАФ while poor nutrition is the largest contributor and responsible for 28.3 per cent of IndiaтАЩs MPI, not having a household member with at least six years of education is the second largest contributor at 16 per cent. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government has decided to ensure piped drinking water to all rural households by 2024, the inadequate access to clean water and child mortality contribute the least, at 2.8 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. To address the issue of poor nutrition, the Food Security Act was introduced in 2013 by the then Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government to provide subsidised foodgrains to the poor. Lack of education, meanwhile, may have led to the inability to access employment, thus contributing to poverty. Dear Reader, Independent and honest journalism is not possible without public support.

1607,Why 'Palasa 1978' is an important Telugu film documenting Dalit resistance,"Films on caste oppression have usually depicted Dalits as a homogeneous oppressed community, but Palasa is a much more nuanced and historically authentic depiction. (Spoilers ahead) Telugu films are usually in the news for the buzz generated by their cast, crew and massive pre-release events. However, once in a while, films like Palasa 1978 garner attention due to their content and understanding of social history. The film, directed by Karuna Kumar, begins with bloodshed. After the title song, we hear the drum beats of a jatara (carnival), and the protagonist Mohan Rao (Rakshit), a Dalit man, beheads Ganapavasu, another Dalit man. The latter is a henchman of the Shavukarus, dominant caste Hindu landlords. While films on caste oppression have usually depicted Dalits as a homogeneous oppressed community, Palasa is a much more nuanced and historically authentic depiction of the violence that├в┬А┬Щs meted out in the name of caste. As the title suggests, the story takes place in Palasa in Andhra Pradesh's Srikakulam district. The year, according to the director, is a nod to certain incidents that reportedly took place in Palasa at that time, and continued for almost four decades. The narrative is interspersed with shots of cashew mills and coconut fields that dot the north coastal region of the state. Dandasi (Laxman), a close friend of Mohan Rao, and a retired police officer, are the narrators of this story which is set in Ambusoli 'colony'. This is where a Dalit artist community ekes out a living by working in cashewnut processing mills that are mostly owned by dominant caste Hindus. Pitting Dalits against Dalits Both Mohan Rao and his elder brother Ranga Rao (Thiruveer) believe in violence as a remedy. The former, especially, is convinced that anyone who hurts their self-respect deserves to be dealt with severely. The director seems to have been inspired by books like Kalyan Rao's Antarani Vasantam (Untouchable Spring) in Telugu and Roots by Alex Haley, in charting out a journey to explore the structural violence on Dalits and their struggles. The characters of Peddasavukaru (Jenny), the main antagonist, and Chinnasavukaru (Raghu Kunche), show how dominant castes go to any extent to retain their power in a village. It├в┬А┬Щs still a common practice for dominant castes, at least in the parts I come from, to pitch one Dalit against another. However, such portrayals are rare in cinema. In a crucial scene in Palasa, Peddasavukaru makes Ranga Rao feel ├в┬А┬Шspecial├в┬А┬Щ by making him sit close. He also serves Ranga Rao his food. In another scene, Peddasavukaru├в┬А┬Щs son, Tarakesh, tries to placate Mohan Rao├в┬А┬Щs brother-in-law by giving him money. However, despite their attempts, the two dominant caste men fail to turn them against Mohan Rao. In Untouchable Spring, Kalyan Rao writes about how dominant caste landlords create a rift between two vulnerable Dalit communities. In Palasa, the director also shows the rift within the same community. Mohan Rao grows up with Laxmi (Nakshatra ) and eventually marries her. She├в┬А┬Щs a great artist in her brother Muthyalu├в┬А┬Щs troop. However, Ganapavasu accidentally kills her while trying to shoot Mohan Rao to avenge his father├в┬А┬Щs death. Ganapavasu, like many Dalit youngsters in the late 1980s and ├в┬А┬Ш90s, joins the Naxalite movement. While many joined the movement genuinely believing that they can bring about change, some like Ganapavasu signed up for it to have power over their own people (the oppressed). He later returns, only to be pitted against Mohan Rao. Dalit characters on screen are almost never represented and if they are, they are usually painted by the same broad brush. In Palasa, however, Karuna Kumar marks the contrast in the personalities of Bairagi (Uma Maheshwar Rao), a Dalit man working for Peddasavukaru, his son Ganapavasu, and the two Rao brothers. The movie is also loaded with historical references to caste atrocities in the Telugu states, from Karamchedu (1985) to Tsunduru (1991), and even the more recent Laximipeta (2012). ├в┬А┬ШEducate, agitate, organise├в┬А┬Щ The resistance is not limited to the male characters alone. Ranga Rao's partner Gajula Gowri is shown as a bold woman. When the Dalits try to take water from a tank in the field belonging to the dominant castes, she gets into a confrontation with the latter. A dominant caste man humiliates them saying, ├в┬А┬ЬToday you ask for water, tomorrow you will take a bath in this!├в┬А┬Э Gowri points out that dominant caste men don't think about the caste of Dalit women when making sexual advances or committing rape. In the second half, the story of Sebastian (Vijay Ram), a sincere and law-abiding Dalit police officer who hails from the manual scavenging community, depicts the struggle of a first generation police officer who├в┬А┬Щs striving to bring change through education. """"In my childhood, my father showed me a great man's idol...with a book in one hand and his finger pointing towards our goal,├в┬А┬Э Sebastian tells Mohan Rao. It is these words that transform Mohan Rao and make him ├в┬А┬Шeducate, agitate and organise├в┬А┬Щ within the framework of the Indian Constitution. But though this gives the viewer some hope, it is deflated when years later, Sebastian himself wants Mohan Rao to choose violence. The former realises that he couldn├в┬А┬Щt deliver justice to the people after all, thereby throwing light on the harsh reality of how Indian democracy functions. Palasa shows that when there is oppression everywhere, Dalits have no choice but to embrace resistance - as said in Untouchable Spring, """"For us, resistance is not an ideal, but mandatory."""" In the last scene, when Mohan Rao surrenders to the police with two severed heads, he says, ├в┬А┬ЬIf I had been the same Mohan Rao of the past, the third bag would have had the head of Tarakesh.├в┬А┬Э He reiterates that his people are looking for change, for a society where everyone can live with equal respect and dignity. As he walks into the cell at the police station, he says that he wishes to see a society which will not have Dalits killing themselves on university campuses and murders happening over intercaste marriage. In Mohan Rao├в┬А┬Щs last shot, the portrait of Dr BR Ambedkar can be seen next to him on the wall outside the cell. This suggests that the struggle has not come to an end but that this is actually a new beginning towards a more humane society. Mohan Rao's legacy can be continued if the resistance is in multiple forms - entering the bureaucracy, politics, judiciary, media and each field that dominant caste Hindus have monopolised, besides also being ready to confront oppression whenever required. The movie also celebrates the Srikakulam dialect, which is otherwise belittled or confined to comedians, despite its rich cultural and literary heritage. An average Telugu person from the other end of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh like me, may not understand the Srikakulam dialect otherwise, but Karuna Kumar, who is also the writer of the film, eases us in by choosing each word in a sentence according to the context. At a time when mainstream Telugu cinema mainly has protagonists from three-four districts, namely the Krishna, Guntur and twin Godavari districts, and a few dominant castes, leaving only comic or villain roles for the rest, Palasa 1978 comes as a welcome change.  ┬й2021 the news minute",0,0,1,3
1609,"Telangana Man Who Got The Husband Of Her Daughter Killed Because He Was A Dalit, Commits Suicide","Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the sensational Pranay Perumalla honour killing case in Telangana, was found dead in what appears to be a case of suicide. According to the police, the body of Rao was found in the Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Khairatabad on Sunday morning. The wife of Rao had claimed that he had been missing since Saturday. Police said they have not registered a case and it appeared that Rao had taken his own life.  """"Maruti Rao was found dead in the morning. He has committed suicide, the case has not yet registered. Further investigation underway,"""" Saifabad Deputy Commissioner of Police said. He was the main accused in the murder of Pranay Perumalla, the 24-year-old Dalit man who was killed in September 2018. Perumalla was married to Amrutha, the daughter of Rao, who was against the marriage as the boy was a Dalit while Rao's family belonged to the upper caste. Pranay belonged to Madiga scheduled caste whereas Amrutha was from Vysya caste.  Perumalla was hacked to death by a hitman hired by Rao, in front of his mother and Amrutha who was pregnant at the time, outside a hospital in Miryalaguda while they were stepping out. The entire incident was caught on CCTV camera and had sent shockwaves across the state and the country. The CCTV images revealed that the attacker had conducted the recce of the area. Amrutha later told police that she suspected her father, Maruthi Rao, to be behind the murder because her family was against their marriage and wanted to have her child aborted.  He had allegedly paid Rs 1 crore to get Perumalla killed. During the investigation, it came to light that the assassins had made four previous attempts to kill him, but had failed. Rao, who was arrested in the case, was out on bail. In June last year, the police had filed the charge sheet in the case naming Rao as the prime accused and seven others, including Subash Sharma - the man who hacked Perumalla to death. Family members alleged that he ended life due to the harassment by the police. Amrutha, however, felt that her father could have ended his life due to the guilt of killing Pranay """"We have no clarity yet, my father might have committed suicide due to regret after they killed Pranay. I never spoke to him nor saw him after that."""" Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time, has since given birth to a baby boy. Start a conversation, not a fire. Post with kindness.

1621,Kanshiram├втВмтДвs legacy of Dalit empowerment left adrift,"In republican IndiaтАЩs history, there is no politician who can match KanshiramтАЩs life story. No one else could have carved a niche for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and the Minorities as much as he did. He came on the Indian political scene without a resum├й popping with credentials of legacy, inheritance, wealth, title, surname or party. Irrespective of all these barriers, he sculpted a solid, unremitting, electrifying Bahujan movement in India. He hailed from an agriculturist Chamar family, but being a Sikh had no impact on caste exclusions of Dalits in the region. Kanshiram, born on March 15, 1934, was aware of this, yet not to the extent of grasping the nuances of such discrimination. He had naively thought of Brahmins as being a poor and backward community due to their low status in Jaat-dominant Punjab. Also read | Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram тАФ so alike, yet so different In his later life, there was one incident in his diverse working stints that had an impact on him. In 1957, he settled for a job as a research assistant in the Ministry of DefenceтАЩs Explosives Research and Development Laboratory (also called the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory), in Pune. A colleague, a class IV employee, Dinabhana from RajasthanтАЩs Bhangi caste, had taken it upon himself to protest the administrationтАЩs cancellation of holidays for Ambedkar and Buddha Jayanti. As a consequence, he was fired for raising the issue. He chose to fight it in court. Looking at DinabhanaтАЩs unrelenting struggle, Kanshiram turned towards activism to seek social justice and political freedoms. Much of KanshiramтАЩs memories are lived through anecdotes and his speeches. A.R. Akela, a foremost scholar of the Bahujan movement, has compiled a series and published them in Hindi. It must be noted that Kanshiram did not leave extensive written records or archives barring the classic, The Chamcha Age (An Era of the Stooge). Dedicated to Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, The Chamcha Age was later to be the founding ground of a party that would be a disrupter in IndiaтАЩs casteist political spectrum тАФ the Bahujan Samaj Party. Kanshiram started by wanting to do nothing with the tokenised, genuflecting leadership of Dalit leaders that the Poona Pact between Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar had produced. Such a leadership was willing to be the secondary elements of the dominant Congress party. Review of Kanshiram тАФ Leader of the Dalits: A look back at the colourful history of a bahujan leader Following simmering resentment against the political attitude towards Dalits, Kanshiram gathered middle class government employees who were seeking leadership that had a spine and self-pride. He recruited disgruntled intellectuals and government employees to give wheels to the caravan of the Bahujan movement. In current times, KanshiramтАЩs struggle continues to be more popular and his ideas acceptable to second and third generation Dalits who are unwilling to settle for anything less than what they deserve. Educated and with a confident outlook, the young breed of Dalits are now aiming to give life to AmbedkarтАЩs vision тАФ of becoming a part of the ruling class of the country. Through Kanshiram they see a feasible, methodical approach to getting that throne. Almost every student organisation, social and political outfit subscribes to the legacy of Ambedkar. The Bhim Army Ekta Mission, for instance, wants to be seen as a part of KanshiramтАЩs Ambedkarite legacy. The Bhim ArmyтАЩs status is complicated on a national scale. Though its flamboyant leader, Chandrashekhar Azad, has an appeal across caste, religion and regional lines, the organisationтАЩs social base has still to be firmed up. Its apolitical work such as pre-school training, having an atrocity grievance cell and cultural activism needs to be expanded. There needs to be a multi-organisational strategy. Also read | The Bahujan movement needs to reinvent itself There are several Bahujan organisations that work towards Dr. AmbedkarтАЩs dream of a non-caste India. But the origins of this can be traced back to the BAMCEF, or the All India Backward (SC, ST, and OBC) and Minority Communities Employees Federation. Along with his colleagues, Kanshiram began one of the largest unions of government employees. Through BAMCEF, he connected SC, ST, OBCs, and other minorities to fight back against atrocities and discrimination. With a structure in place, he was able to help create a strong sense of accountability towards the community. Thus, the widely popular initiative тАШPay Back to SocietyтАЩ was inaugurated in 1973. As a part of BAMCEF there were simultaneous initiatives such as the BAMCEF Datta Grahan, -Bhaichara, -Sahkarita. In 1981, the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS-4) with 10 wings (students, women, etc.) was established to experiment with socio-political possibilities. Eventually the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was formally established in 1984. Kanshiram declared that he wanted the community to become givers rather than receivers. For that to happen it required training and preparation. Cadre camps and various events filled the gap. Instead of downplaying the importance of caste, Kanshiram opted to strengthen oppressed caste associations which was one way to weaken the structures that sustain caste. Every тАШupperтАЩ caste had an investment in caste, which is why it transferred this into structures that catered to its needs. Kanshiram invested in the cultures of caste and cultural methods of anti-casteism. He understood well that artists and in turn their art were organic intellectuals who were a part of the grass-roots. He sought them out and trained them. It is no accident that the тАШAmbedkar Mela on WheelsтАЩ was among the many first Dalit History Month projects that featured AmbedkarтАЩs photographs, books, pamphlets and posters. Also read | Mayawati, rebel leaders fight for Kanshi RamтАЩs legacy Kanshiram understood that emotional appeal was a far more powerful way to use radical anger that would help tackle the oppressor. Thus, the artwork and paintings depicting atrocities on the communities played a pivotal role in his outreach initiatives. He had grasped early on that while emotions are essential, a strategy was also needed to direct peopleтАЩs thoughts into producing material. His deft editorial skills also found expression. The popular The Oppressed Indian and the Bahujan Sanghatak were his organisationтАЩs mouthpieces. There were others that dealt with land reform, nationalisation of industries and a labour welfare regime such as Aarthik Utthan (1980) and Economic Monthly (1981) in addition to the impressive Bahujan Times (1984). Kanshiram can be said to be the leader who introduced Periyar to villages in north, central, eastern and western India. Like Periyar, there were many unsung heroes who were given space on the canvas of the BSP. They include Nandanar, Iyothee Thass, Nangeli, Birsa Munda, Savitribai Phule and Jhalkaribai. In hindsight, we are yet to find similar investments by his prot├йg├йs. There are certainly no intellectual research wings, as was the case earlier, which can provide guidance to the movement. There is no media that can converse with the public on a daily basis on Dalit issues; neither is there any trust-building mechanism. Finally, moving to the present state of the BSP, it appears that the party leadership lacks a committed young cadre that can be trained to take over the reins of the leadership. KanshiramтАЩs legacy remains alive and kicking in the words of the BSPтАЩs chief Mayawati. But in the absence of any credible sourcing of talent, organisations such as the Bhim Army and many BAMCEF-BSP inspired regional parties could step in and fill the vacuum.

1623,Nation comes together demanding justice for Hathras Dalit gang rape victim | SabrangIndia,"Demonstrations and protests held in Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of India  Thousands of people flooded Delhi's streets on October 2 to show solidarity with the Hathras gang rape victim. Youth, women's groups, activists and ordinary citizens came together to decry the heinous crime and the insensitive manner in which the Uttar Pradesh government handled the incident. The past few weeks have been reminiscent of the pre-Covid-19 times when people protested the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of the BJP-led government in 2019. This time, around 5,000 people gathered at the Jantar Mantar protest in Delhi that was originally planned to be held at India Gate. Despite the last-minute change in venue, people arrived at the spot to denounce the atrocity suffered by the 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras. A video by a member of the If We Do Not Rise interviewed various people at the protest to show the varying demands of the protesters.

Youth, women's groups, activists and ordinary citizens came together to decry the heinous crime and the insensitive manner in which the Uttar Pradesh government handled the incident. The past few weeks have been reminiscent of the pre-Covid-19 times when people protested the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of the BJP-led government in 2019. This time, around 5,000 people gathered at the Jantar Mantar protest in Delhi that was originally planned to be held at India Gate. Despite the last-minute change in venue, people arrived at the spot to denounce the atrocity suffered by the 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras.

1628,"A Dalit in the Sangh: Bhanwar Meghwanshi's disillusionment with RSS lays bare agenda of Brahmin colonisation-Living News , Firstpost","The story of Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a Dalit youth who was associated with the RSS as a Karsevak, is one of breaking free from the mental colonisation by the Brahmins through the RSS. His fight against the Sangh, after having experienced their agenda against minorities first-hand, is primarily shaped by the intellectual quest for his history, and his vision to resurrect the history of Dalits, which has been appropriated by the RSS. In 1925, India stood at a 22 year-long-distance from its 'independence' from its colonisers, the British. But for the Dalits, the meaning of freedom was incomplete without the community breaking away from the clutches of Brahmanism. For them, the тАШrealтАЩ colonisation constituted the rules and diktats of Brahmanical society (caste system), under which they were treated as outcasts. For them, the real colonisers were and have always been Brahmins. Time and again, their literature speaks this truth. From the year 1925, as the decline of British rule started becoming a conceivable reality, the plan to colonise Dalits and consequently other lower castes, including Adivasis, was set in motion with the birth of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). What had pushed the need for RSS, as felt by Brahmins, was the threat to their dominance in an independent nation, imagined on democratic, secular, and just principles, as prescribed by the Indian Constitution. From the beginning, the agenda of the RSS was to bring all Dalits, Adivasis, and other lower caste communities under the umbrella of 'Hinduism'. These marginalised communities, however, had their own histories, deities, cultures, languages, and ideas of life. The RSSтАЩs function was to examine and uproot said communities from their origins of being and belonging, and construct a new history for them that must support the dominance of Brahmins. Consequently, said upper-caste dominant community is now suddenly feeling threatened by the liberty, equality and fraternity constitutionally bestowed upon each citizen of the bygone-British India. Once you are uprooted from your history, and a new history built by the dominant caste is imposed on you, you are bound to hate your own kith and kin. While the British coloniser exploits your labour, the Brahmin coloniser exploits your history. With labour gone, you are filled with rage; but with history gone, you are filled with confusion. Bhanwar Meghwanshi. Facebook/bm075 This new history is constructed around myths concocted by Brahmins, in which you are given a place in the тАШnational imaginationтАЩ, but in disguise. What now compels the Dalit, the Adivasi, and the lower caste youth to be a part of it is an infatuation of patriotism, a newly found enemy to accuse, fiery speeches, rhetoric of hate, and the тАШdivineтАЩ idea of working for the motherland, or the 'matrubhoomi'. In his book The Wretched of the Earth, post-colonial theorist and philosopher Frantz Fanon explains that the """"youth of a colonised country, growing up in an atmosphere of shot and fire, may well make a mock of, and does not hesitate to pour scorn upon the zombies of his ancestors, the horses with two heads, the dead who rise again and the djinns who rush into your body while you yawn.тАЭ The story of Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a Dalit youth who was associated with the RSS as a Karsevak, elucidates what Fanon tried to explain. But his account, as told in his book I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, is also one of breaking free from the mental colonisation by the Brahmins through the RSS. When your body is used for its labor to spread vicious propaganda, but you are rejected as a mind and a human being with dignity, it then generates strong repulsion for the propaganda you so far dedicated your life to. This experience is curiously revealing in a caste-based society, and one doesn't 'understand' the gravity of caste discrimination unless is it 'felt' or 'experienced'. In case of the young Bhanwar Meghwanshi, the RSS had been an organisation with almost a sacred vision: the creation of the 'Hindu Rashtra'. Through the propaganda, he was raised through his youth and made to feel like a тАШproudтАЩ Hindu. It was only when the food from his home was refused and thrown away by upper caste-Brahmin Swayamsewaks, that he came to taste the poison of caste and discrimination in their entirety тАФ the founding principle of the 'Hindu Rashtra' and the RSS. About this, he dejectedly writes: тАЬFor the first time in my life that day, I stepped aside from my Hindu identity and started seeing the world like a person from a lower caste. My troubled thoughts kept me awake all night, a night that felt endless.тАЭ Through his stint in the RSS, he was raised as a proud Hindu. However, later, he was viciously rejected as a Dalit; as the one unabatedly questioning the myths fed by the RSS to innocent Dalits, Adivasis and lower caste youth. There's another instance in which his aspirations to become an RSS Pracharak was mutilated by asinine, baseless responses from Savarna leaders, and which revealed to him the hypocrisy of the organisation. This is exactly where we understand the functioning of caste in India. Thus far, the youth of the country across castes, reeling under Brahmin colonisation, was being manipulated by mythical and baseless answers from the RSS, which constantly preached about being an 'Other Superior', while simultaneously being made to feel exploited by enemies of other religions. Youth in India, scattered across hundreds of castes and never sharing a monolithic history, is now made to feel a 'proud' Hindu. Meghwanshi's years in the RSS reveal this trajectory of creation of a new identity, which is then used to mobilise people as a singular force, and propagate the agenda of Brahmins. In a broader sense, after his bitter experience of being exploited by the RSS, he goes on to open up a dialogue with other Dalits from the organisation, only to realise that his distinct understanding of the prejudiced and vicious ways of the RSS is also shared by many from these castes. He felt he is not alone, when it comes to being cheated by the Sangh. He also discovers that discrimination in the RSS is not limited to him, but is a norm practiced in terms of treating people from marginalised and lower caste communities. Though many of them did not talk about their agonies, his comprehension of the RSS is shared by many. He says: тАЬFor the first time I saw that this was not my personal pain, but that of every swayamsevak of my community. The difference was that they were willing to accept it quietly, and I was not.тАЭ Bhanwar Meghwanshi. Facebook/bm075 This, in turn, has given birth to a rebel within him. A Dalit, who's experienced first-hand the agenda of the RSS and its lethality for Dalits, Adivasis and other lower caste communities, decided to fight against it. This fight is primarily shaped by the intellectual quest for his history, his vision to resurrect the history of Dalits, which is appropriated by the RSS, and making people aware of the scope of acquiring dignity and a human personality that is guaranteed by the Constitution of India. While facing countless threats from the RSS as he works tirelessly to fulfil Ambedkar, Phule, Kabir, and the Buddha's visions, he, however, does not fall prey to regressive positions. But despite all of this, a vision of the world rooted in love seems like a definite possibility to him, as he invokes Kabir while writing about the idea of love in his life: тАЬOf course, life is not simple, nothing is as straightforward as it might appear on the surface, there are ups and downs. It has sometimes felt as if we are life partners only in name, but the two and a half letters that Kabir says make up the word prem (dhai aakhar prem ka) - this love has always survived every trial. My life with Prem, my marriage to her, has taught me that at any point in life one could meet someone, at any point lose someone, one never knows. It is all a matter of fortuity. But I am grateful for the countless blessings in my life, and my heartfelt desire is that there comes a day when the words тАШloveтАЩ and тАШlifeтАЩ become synonymous.тАЭ Who else could understand the profound and true meaning of revolution, than the one whose idea of life is synonymous to love? тАФ That too while fighting the most vicious enemy in the world: the colonisers of the mind тАФ the Brahmins, the RSS. Updated Date: March 17, 2020 11:01:55 IST TAGS: The book will be published in October 2021. """"How can you say those who favour the concept of a Hindu Rashtra are of Talibani mindset?

The massive peaceful protests in the national capital were led by citizens and activists, had been going on since the day the Dalit victim was brought to Delhi in a critical condtiion, and later succumbed to her injuries at Safdarjung Hospital.

The Police issued a statement on the protest: тАЬMembers of many political parties and different NGOs in different groups reached Jantar Mantar to stage a protest demanding harsh punishment for accused persons in Hathras Gangrape Case,тАЭ and added that some protestors were from groups that тАЬwere demanding fair investigation in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.тАЭ The Delhi Police, as reported by news media, have stated that the protestors have violated orders under Section 144 CrPC, and other laws related to Covid-19 protocol, a case under section 188 of IPC, 3 Epidemic Act and 51(b) Disaster Management Act, and cases were subsequently registered at Parliament Street police station. The protests peaked on October 2, as the world observed the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as the International Day of Non-Violence. Even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal showed up at Jantar Mantar to in soliarity with those protesting to seek justice for the Dalit victim who was gangraped in Hathras. Dalit organisations, student and womenтАЩs groups, members of Bhim Army and Left parties, were a part of the protest that was originally to be held at India Gate, and when that area was closed, moved to Jantar Mantar, which before the lockdown was the designated venue for most protests. As the protest grew and more people came in even there all day, the Delhi Police added swiftly, and charged the protesters, just as their colleagues in Uttar Pradesh police continued to do. Lawyer Prashant Bhushan posted: тАЬThe govt, scared of public outrage on the #HathrasHorrorтАж Now police will charge protesters!тАЭ  The govt, scared of public outrage on the #HathrasHorror shut IndiaGate where protestors were to gather.

The Police issued a statement on the protest: тАЬMembers of many political parties and different NGOs in different groups reached Jantar Mantar to stage a protest demanding harsh punishment for accused persons in Hathras Gangrape Case,тАЭ and added that some protestors were from groups that тАЬwere demanding fair investigation in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.тАЭ The Delhi Police, as reported by news media, have stated that the protestors have violated orders under Section 144 CrPC, and other laws related to Covid-19 protocol, a case under section 188 of IPC, 3 Epidemic Act and 51(b) Disaster Management Act, and cases were subsequently registered at Parliament Street police station. The protests peaked on October 2, as the world observed the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as the International Day of Non-Violence. Even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal showed up at Jantar Mantar to in soliarity with those protesting to seek justice for the Dalit victim who was gangraped in Hathras. Dalit organisations, student and womenтАЩs groups, members of Bhim Army and Left parties, were a part of the protest that was originally to be held at India Gate, and when that area was closed, moved to Jantar Mantar, which before the lockdown was the designated venue for most protests. As the protest grew and more people came in even there all day, the Delhi Police added swiftly, and charged the protesters, just as their colleagues in Uttar Pradesh police continued to do. Lawyer Prashant Bhushan posted: тАЬThe govt, scared of public outrage on the #HathrasHorrorтАж Now police will charge protesters!тАЭ  The govt, scared of public outrage on the #HathrasHorror shut IndiaGate where protestors were to gather. The site was shifted to JantarMantar. As large numbers were gathering there,that too was shut down.Yet,1000s gathered to express their rage. Now police will charge protestors!  Of course, it is not yet known if Uttar Pradesh police have take the cue from Delhi Police and charged the 'upper caste' panchayat that was convened in Uttar Pradesh to support the rape and murder accused, of violating the Covid-19 protocols.

1650,"Elderly Dalit man brutally beaten up on suspicion of theft, dies","Jump to navigation Speak Now A Dalit man died 12 days after he was brutally beaten up in Rajasthan's Sikar district on suspicion of mobile theft. Madan Lal Meena, 75, passed away at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur, where he was brought in a serious condition. The police have so far arrested five accused in the case. """"Jitendra Yadav, Bharatbhushan, Dilip Singh, Sandeep Meena and Sandeep Yadav have been arrested in the case, Dinesh Agrawal, Additional SP, said. Anil Yadav, another person named in the matter is absconding. The man, Madan Lal Meena, was beaten up in Rajasthan's Sikar district by five men, who suspected him of stealing mobile phones from a Bhandaara or a large place meant for collective eating. The incident took place on March 4. A video of the old man being brutally beaten up by the accused in the case went viral on the social media on March 5. Thereafter, the old man's son got an FIR registered in the matter on March 8. The police has failed to nab any of the accused in the case so far. The victim of the brutal assault was admitted at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur with grave injuries to his body. A metal rod had to be inserted in the foot of the man and his hip bone had broken allegedly because of the brutal assault. In the video, the old man can be heard swearing by his son, claiming that he has not stolen the mobiles. However, the accused persons kept beating him up even mercilessly. After some time, they left as the old man kept writhing in pain. The accused men had allegedly abducted the old man on suspicion of stealing five mobile phones from the Khatu Shyam Ji's fair in Rajasthan's Sikar district. They were working in the catering section of the Bhandara. Madan Lal Meena was abducted in a jeep and taken to a deserted place two kilometres. The man's son got an FIR registered in the case on March 8. Kanaram, son of Madan Lal, is a police constable currently posted in Delhi.

1653,"Dalit Advocate, a BAMCEF Activist, in Kutch Killed for Alleged ├втВм╦ЬAnti-Brahmin├втВмтДв Posts | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS In yet another instance of caste violence, a dalit advocate in GujaratтАЩs Kutch district was killed, allegedly for his social media posts against Brahmins. Devji Maheshwari, 50, was murdered in broad daylight in Rapar taluka of Kutch district, Gujarat, on September 26. He was a senior activist associated with All India Backward and Minority Communities (BAMCEF) and member of Indian Legal Professionals Associations and was involved in various struggles, including for land rights for dalits. The Kutch police claimed that Maheshwari was killed for his social media posts against Brahmins, but the advocateтАЩs wife has alleged that there was more to it than meets the eye as he was involved in fighting for land and property rights of dalits. Bharat Raval, a 22-year-old resident of Malad, Mumbai and native of Rapar, Kutch, belonging to brahmin community, was arrested by the local police in less than 24 hours of MaheshwariтАЩs murder after he was identified from a CCTV footage. In the footage, Raval is seen waiting outside MaheshwariтАЩs office, follows him inside and runs out minutes later. Maheshwari is seen coming out after Raval, with his shirt soaked in blood, reportedly from multiple stab wounds. He succumbed to his injuries before he could be taken to a hospital. In accordance with local police, Raval confessed that, тАЬhe could not take MaheshwariтАЩs anti-Hindu and anti-brahmin Facebook posts anymore.тАЭ Reportedly, Maheshwari and Raval had a spat repeatedly over the past one month. Rava had warned Maheshwari to not create trouble as they hailed from same village. He had also threatened Maheshwari in his office once. The last Facebook post by Maheshwari was a video of Waman Meshram, National President of BAMCEF, saying that people belonging to Schedule Castes, Scheduled tribes and Other Backward Classes are not Hindus. Mumbai Police, who arrested Raval and handed him over to Gujarat police, said he travelled on September 23 with an intention to kill Maheshwari. He was arrested under various sections of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act, charges of murder and criminal conspiracy. Notably, Minaxiben Maheshwari, wife of the deceased advocate, has alleged that the murder was part of larger conspiracy than a spat over social media post. The FIR which was registered based on complaint by Minaxiben Maheshwari stated, тАЬDevji Maheshwari left his residence at around 7.30 am on the day in a private vehicle for Bhuj for a legal matter in connection with a property case that involved Luhar Community Hall (a land dispute between two communities). He returned at around 3.30 left for his office. No lawyer was ready to take the case of the community hall and my husband did. He used to keep the papers related to the case with and tried in vain to lodge a FIR in the matter. The rival party had threatened to kill my husband several times as he was in possession of those papers. It is my suspicion that they hired Bharat Raval to kill him.тАЭ Gujarat police has also named eight others in the FIR, of which five have been arrested so far. Noticeably, dalits from Rapar and neighbouring areas erupted in protest and refused to accept the body until accused are arrested. The protestors blocked highways and burnt tyres as a mark of protest. MaheshwariтАЩs body that was kept in a government hospital was accepted later by the family. In January this year, a dalit girl was found hanging from a tree in Sabarkantha district. While family alleged that she was raped and killed by upper caste men of the village, an SIT formed to investigate the case declared victim was neither raped nor murdered. In July, a 27 year old dalit youth was kidnapped and killed by upper caste men of his village for suspicion of theft. He was the sole earner of his family. In 2019, a data compiled by Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe Cell Gandhinagar, revealed that 568 cases of caste atrocity were registered till May of which 16 murder cases, 30 were of grievously hurt and 36 rape cases. In May 2019, Rajesh Sondarva son of a dalit RTI activist was thrashed to death near Rajkot by men accused of killing his father two years ago. The accused were out on bail. In June 2019, Piyush Sarvaiya, brother Lalji Sarvaiya who was burnt alive by an upper caste mob in 2012, was attacked by one of the convicts accused of killing his brother. The accused who attacked Sarvaiya was out on parole at the time. The same month, Manjibhai Solanki, a 55-year-old deputy Sarpanch was attacked with pipes and rods by upper caste men of his village. Solanki who had reportedly irked the upper caste men as he had helped dalits of the village to lodge cases of atrocity against them, succumbed to his injuries on way to hospital. The third incident of caste atrocity in the state in June 2019 was the murder of 34-year-old Prakash Parmar. ParmarтАЩs brother had lodged a complaint against the men belonging to Darbar (Kshatriya) community who attacked him. On July 8, Haresh Solanki, 22-year-old dalit man was hacked to death allegedly by his wifeтАЩs family members who belong to upper caste community. Solanki was attempting to meet his pregnant wife at her parentтАЩs house near Ahmedabad. Between the years 2016 and 2018, dalits have been killed in Gujarat for riding a horse, watching Garba, a traditional Gujarati dance during months of Navratri festival, marrying an upper caste man or woman, raising voice against upper caste men in villages for civil rights. Dalits have been thrashed for wearing mojri, a traditional Indian footwear, sporting a moustache, sporting a photo of Shivaji on his vehicle and riding a horse in oneтАЩs own wedding. Dalits have been socially boycotted for attempting to drink water from the only water-well in the village as they are considered тАШuntouchablesтАЩ by the local villagers.",1,3,1,3
1663,Discrimination Continues to Target Dalit Women Labour in Punjab,"8 September 2021 08:56 PM RAJEEV KHANNA | 16 MARCH, 2020 Why rural PunjabтАЩs Dalit women workers need to organise There is an urgent need for the Dalit women labourers of rural Punjab to organise themselves into unions and groups to take forward their battle for human existence. This is the view of intellectuals and activists on the ground who have been working with this segment of people, aired at a discussion at Punjabi University in Patiala on Friday at the release of a landmark study titled тАШKhise Khali, Thid Bhukhe, Tan Liran: Pendu Punjab De Dalit Aurat Mazdoor Parivaran Da Ik SarvekhanтАЩ (Empty Pockets, Hungry Stomachs, Tatters on the Body: A Survey of Dalit Women Labour Families of Rural Punjab). Compiled by a team - Dharampal, Gurinder Kaur, Veerpal Kaur and Jyoti - directed by economic expert Gian Singh, the survey points to an extremely dismal scenario. These households are living in abject poverty and hardly find any place in the priorities of the heavily embedded media or the political and administrative class. тАЬWe are often told no, the situation cannot be this bad. We counter such people by saying that they should themselves conduct such studies to see for themselves,тАЭ Gian Singh disclosed. Data for the study was collected from 927 Dalit women labour households across four sample districts of Jalandhar, Amritsar, Mansa and Fatehgarh Sahib representing the Doaba, Majha and Malwa regions of Punjab. Besides several other indicators, the study reveals that 61.7% of Dalit women labourers suffer from one or other serious conditions like body aches, diabetes, blood pressure, bronchial problems, heat exhaustion, gynecological problems and the like in the rural areas of Punjab. This is primarily because of unhygienic living conditions and malnutrition. тАЬAs the government hospitals and clinical laboratories are scarcely available in the rural areas, they find no other option than to consult the local medical practitioners for the purpose,тАЭ it says. The survey found that 24.5% of respondents had faced discrimination at the workplace on the basis of their caste. The so-called тАШhigher casteтАЩ employers often use filthy language for them. Further, тАЬIt is pertinent to note that 5.50 per cent of the respondents have faced sexual exploitation at the workplace. Another 23.95 per cent respondents faced no such type of harassment at the workplace. However, majority of the respondents (70.55 per cent) gave no response in this regard. This may have been because of saving their chastity in the society,тАЭ the study says. Activists confirm that the majority of these women face sexual harassment. тАЬThey do not come out and speak about it. It takes multiple interactions to get them to talk on this subject. This is an uncomfortable truth,тАЭ said Kiran of the Kisan Mazdoor Khudkushi Peedit Parivar Committee. тАЬThe reason behind this reluctance is that women are considered to be gehna (jewels) or izzat (pride) of the house,тАЭ added Bimal Kaur of the Krantikari Pendu Mazdoor Union. The study says that due to lack of knowledge about the Minimum Wages Act, 91.9% of rural Dalit women labourers are not aware of the standard working hours fixed under the law. тАЬFurther, 37.32 per cent are not being paid equal wages for equal work with men,тАЭ it underlines. There is also an all important need to ensure these women get full days of employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. It was pointed out at the discussion that the scenario with regard to MGNREGA implementation is pathetic. тАЬHave you ever seen a government drive to popularise MGNREGA? The main question is why it is not being done,тАЭ said economic expert Dr Balwinder Singh Tiwana. Tiwana further said that these women must organise themselves and agitate to get their dues, in a state like Punjab where a semi feudal society prevails. тАЬIt must be understood that doles do not work. The socio-economic structure has to be changed,тАЭ he said, pointing to the non implementation of land reforms. тАЬThe ruling class is cunning. Till the time social discrimination exists, there can be no development.тАЭ It was underlined that land rights to Dalits can take them forward in a big way and land ownership means empowerment for this community. тАЬOn one side we have a situation where bonded labour continues and on the other, working as farm labour or marginal farmers does not make farming remunerative. They need to be given land as it will take them forward. We need a movement towards this direction,тАЭ said Paramjit Kaur of the Zamin Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC) which has been taking forward the fight for land rights to Dalits in Sangrur and adjoining areas of Malwa region of the state. Observing that Dalit women labourers are landless, the study emphasises the need to introduce land reforms in favour of Dalits, who have remained a neglected lot for ages. To substantiate this contention the study points to Balad Kalan village in Sangrur, where under the aegis of ZPSC the Dalit households have been able to take control of village common land on a lease-in basis despite the opposition of many. тАЬIt has provided them a feeling of self-respect. Now the Dalit women do not require to go to the fields of large farmers for fodder, vegetables, and food grains,тАЭ the study reports. In villages where Dalit families have got cultivation rights on common lands, the ZPSC has successfully been able to promote the co-operative farming model. тАЬCo-operative farming did not fail in India on its own. It was deliberately failed,тАЭ said Paramjit Kaur. Another important aspect highlighted by the study is the extent of indebtedness in such households. With higher consumption expenditure than their income, 96.3% of Dalit woman labour households are in debt in rural areas of Punjab. тАЬFurther, the Dalit woman labour households, on an average, take 80.40 per cent of their total debt from the non-institutional sources mainly from the large farmers and landlords. It has been observed that the Dalit woman labour households find it easy to incur debt from non-institutional sources and they hesitate to incur debt from institutional sources,тАЭ the study says. This is primarily because being illiterate they do not understand the formalities and procedures to be followed for availing loans from institutional sources. The indifferent attitude of the officials disappoints them, and under the prevailing feudal system large farmers and landlords easily provide loans with the sole aim of exploiting them. Their main interest lies in ensuring a supply of labour during the peak season when the demand for labour is quite high. A positive aspect of this grave problem is that 76.3% of the total debt incurred by such households is for productive purposes.

1665,"Maruthi Rao who got Dalit son-in-law killed in Miryalaguda, found dead"," Wednesday, Sep 08, 2021 | Last Update : 08:56 PM IST The love story of Miryalguda couple Amrutha and Pranay which ended in tragedy after the father of girl, Maruthi Rao, hired contract killers to eliminate Dalit son-in-law took an interesting turn on Sunday. Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the murder of 24-year-old Dalit boy Pranay in Miryalguda, was found dead inside a room at Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Hyderabad.  The police who found him dead in the room suspect suicide. However, they are not concluding anything yet and probing the reason for his arrival to Hyderabad. The body was sent to Osmania Hospital in Hyderabad for post mortem. It may be recalled that Maruthi Rao, the deceased had paid Rs 1 crore to contract killers to get rid of Pranay, who hailed from Dalit community. Maruthi Rao was against his daughter Amrutha marrying Pranay. Pranay was killed just outside the hospital where the couple had gone to get a check-up done on Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time.  The police had named eight people in the chargesheet including Maruthi Rao. Media men were quick to rush to Amrutha to get her reaction on her father's death. A calm and composed Amrutha told the press that she had cut off all communication with her father since the murder of her husband. She also said that the she learnt about her father's demise only through the media and was waiting for confirmation from her relatives before she could offer any more comments.

1671,"Gujarat: SIT Says No Rape, No Murder in Modasa Dalit Rape Case | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of CID (crime) that was constituted to investigate the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl who was found hanging from a tree at Modasa in GujaratтАЩs Aravalli district on January 5, concluded that she was neither raped nor murdered. The SIT report, though incomplete, said that the victim was romantically involved with prime accused Bimal Bharwad. It said that she had hung herself from a tree at Sayra village in Modasa in the intervening night of January 4 and 5 after Bharwad refused to commit to a stable relationship. In a press conference held in Ahmedabad and addressed by DIG Gautam Parmar and SP Virendra Singh, the SIT gave a sequence of events from December 30. They said that the victim, her elder sister, prime accused Bimal Bharwad and three other accused went to Asian Green Hotel and stayed the night. Gautam Parmar who is leading the SIT said, тАЬThe victim and her sister came in touch with accused Bimal Bharwad on December 14 or December 15 last year and met him for the first time on December 17.тАЭ According to their investigation, Bharwad and the victim had engaged in a physical relationship in the next few days and met at the victimтАЩs house and at various guest houses. Parmar said that the victim wanted Bharwad to commit to a stable relationship but Bharwad, being already married, came under pressure to maintain his distance. He then supposedly planned to get her involved with his cousin Akash so that he could blame her of infidelity and end the relationship. тАЬHowever, this did not work and the girl (victim) threatened to expose him,тАЭ Parmar added. тАЬOn January 1, the victim called Bharwad and asked to meet her. Bharwad revealed this to the victimтАЩs sister who advised him against meeting her. Nonetheless, Bharwad decided to meet the victim as she had threatened to expose him lest they met. So Bharwad reached her village, picked her up and drove to Modasa town where they fought for two hours. When the victim refused to get down from BharwadтАЩs car, he called her sister. However, the victim did not relent even after her sister arrived so her sister snatched her phone and smashed it so that she couldnтАЩt try to reach BharwadтАЩs wife. Following which victim got down from the car to check her phone and taking the opportunity, Bharwad fled,тАЭ added Parmar. Aggrieved, the victim took an autorickshaw and reached Sayra, her village, as per the SIT report. The SIT further added that during the investigation, the post mortem report, the FSL report (Forensic Science Laboratory), call details (40 calls from the victim to Bharwad and 67 messages asking him to marry her), statements of seven witnesses under CrPC 164 are among evidences collated and that are to be admitted in court. Reconstruction of Crime Scene as claimed by SIT The SIT has claimed that a reconstruction of the crime scene successfully concluded that it was a case of suicide and not murder. Backing up the claim, DIG Parmar said, тАЬIt is very easy to climb a tree which was demonstrated and hence reconstructed as the crime scene by a female constable.тАЭ тАЬSecondly, other than injuries on the neck caused by the dupatta used for hanging, no other injury was found on victimтАЩs body. The injuries found on victimтАЩs body in the post mortem are said to have caused by bark and branches of the tree. No semen or saliva was found on victimтАЩs body to prove rape, gang rape or unnatural sex (sodomy). Moreover, call records show that the victim had called Bimal Bharwad herself so kidnapping has been ruled out,тАЭ added Parmar. On being asked about post mortem finding of fluids from vagina and rectal prolapse, Parmar said that had occurred due to decomposition of the body. Hole in the SIT report The SIT has admitted that the police is still trying to find out what transpired between January 1, when the victim boarded an autorickshaw to reach Sayra, as claimed by SIT, and January 5, when her body was found hanging by a tree in the outskirts of the village. According to the SIT report, the victimтАЩs movement on January 1 has been traced from her village Sayra to Modasa and back to Sayra in an autorickshaw on the same day. However, the trace went cold after January 1 after which she went missing, as claimed by the family in the FIR. The family had also accused Police Inspector N.K. Rabari of refusing to register a missing person complaint and file a case of illegal detention of the victim on January 2, a day after she went missing. Noticeably, even as SIT probing the case has termed it a suicide, a parallel investigation is being conducted on Rabari for the alleged negligence. Rabari was suspended by the DGP, Gujarat, after allegations surfaced against him and the ADGP of SC/ST cell had initiated an inquiry against him. The SIT report also doesnтАЩt explain why the victim took four days to commit suicide or the reason for the injuries indicated as ante-mortem in the post mortem report. The post mortem report states, тАЬOne ligature mark is in form of dark reddish brown like abrasion on front, right and back of neck.

1672,Dalit Women's Tryst with Indian Political System: In conversation with Cynthia Stephen - NETRI,"A conversation with Cynthia Stephen as a part of a series of interactions with eminent personalities in our effort to enhance the understanding of the current situation pertaining to women in Indian politics. This interview is an ode to Savitri Bai Phule, first Indian feminist, an educator and leader in her own right. Cynthia has worked tirelessly and continues to voice her concerns and fight for the cause of women and especially Dalit women. She is a researcher, who had also undertaken fieldwork for her doctoral thesis on Political empowerment of Dalit Women in India. She writes fiercely, is an optimist, and demands an overhaul of the systemic forces which keeps new entrants, the young, the Dalit and the women out of the power corridors. In the light of her work with the government as a Director of the Mahila Samakhya in Karnataka, and from outside as an activist/writer and an aspiring political contestant, there are many lessons in her experience. She shares generously in this conversation. We ask her our first question: Cynthia Stephen: While there are many similarities in the situation of Dalit women and bl*ck womxn, these situations are at best analogous but not exactly similar. There are far more powerful systems at work in the lives of Dalit women. The barriers placed in front of them are almost insurmountable by themselves. For a race, there is some sort of possibilities, in a certain manner of speaking, for people to be able to transcend the discrimination through an exhibit of hard work, talent and capabilities. These opportunities are not present in the case of caste, and especially not to Dalit womxn in India.Stating it squarely, this is due to Brahminical patriarchy. It has enormous implications and connotations for people in general in India and on Dalit Womxn in particular. Can you elaborate on these real life implications of Brahaminical patriarchy and lived experiences of Dalit womxn, which leads to their social, economic and political exclusion? Cynthia: Even before we address the social, economic and political exclusion of Dalit women it is important to understand a rather more fundamental issue. The position of women within the structure of Indian society is dictated by ancient texts and scriptures, of which Manu Smriti is the most prominent one. We follow Manu Smriti in our personal lives, not in an abstract sense but in a rather existential sense. It is an ancient text which lists norms that the society is expected to follow, based on the caste system of that time. However, we still follow it in current times. A real-life example of Manu Smriti being followed is seen around us. A widowed mother is still expected to stay with her son, despite having a daughter who could either be more resourceful than the son or in another case benefit from the presence of her mother in her home in raising kids or also emotionally. But the mother in most cases refuse. We have divided these gender roles based on norms that repeatedly teach us that women derive their relevance from the man in her life. A womanтАЩs life is spent in male oversight, from father in the childhood to son in the old-age. These norms that women should not have an independent status comes from Manu Smriti. It does not give equal citizenship to women. It has constructed a privileged system for males. Discretion, entitlements and rights of the upper-caste Hindu male dominate the society. The system automatically discriminates against non-dominant caste males and women of all castes. Within this pattern of societal structure and hierarchy, the entire system is geared to transferring power and resources to the male up in the brahminical social order. Subjugation comes down the ladder, entitlements and privileges are distributed up to the top of the ladder. As B.R. Ambedkar put, тАЭ Caste system is not the Division of labour, it is a division of labourersтАЭ. The system only gives a certain kind of responsibility, validity, legitimacy to the people who are at the bottom. This is the reason that we see close to negligible Dalit womxn in any kind of positions of power and decision making. It is only because of the constitutional structure and certain level of peopleтАЩs movement that brought Mayawati, a Dalit woman, to the helm of power and political rule in a state like Uttar Pradesh. Though now the socio-political situations have changed and her politics is becoming rapidly irrelevant in the present time. The system very quickly delegitimises a woman in public life. These aspects of patriarchy are the barriers behind Dalit womenтАЩs exclusion at all levels. Cynthia: To understand the social factors at play in the lives of Black women, it is important to understand the role of mothers and women in the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. During that period, the black women were very active in their churches as community leaders and had a big role in mobilizing, motivating and supporting each other in the struggle. Rosa Parks, famously known as the тАЬmother of the freedom movementтАЭ and тАЬthe first lady of civil rightsтАЭ sparked the beginning of the first direct campaign in the post-war civil rights movement. She refused to give up her seat to a white man in the bus, was chosen to see through a court challenge following her arrest related to the matter, and this inspired people to boycott Montgomery buses for over a year. This was not an act of spontaneity in my understanding. She was already a part of large community-based leaders who were organising and resisting and working to build each other up. In contrast to the Dalit women, there is a lack of support to womenтАЩs internal social organisation. Ironically, the most active and strongest women networks in India are that of Dalit women, they still do not receive the extent of recognition received by the black womenтАЩs movement in the west. As a result of the lack of support structure for Dalit womenтАЩs mobilisation, these mobilisations are de-legitimised in Indian society and not given the value it deserves. Cynthia: Women are getting increasingly active in the political sphere. A large number of independent women are getting into the fray right from panchayat to parliament. I believe, this is the way ahead. Women want to get involved in politics. For instance, every political party has a large-base and active women wing. But the same parties are not inclined towards giving a proportionate number of tickets to women, or even put women in powerful positions within the party, with the exception of the women wing itself or the women who come from political partyтАЩs first family. An organisation which I was a part of, Mahila Samakhya in Karnatak, federated women from the grassroots up to the taluk level. Lakhs of women became a part of this network, who are still involved in their communities and work as leaders on different public issues. Some of them are also willing to enter grassroots politics. Howerver beyond district/taluk level there is a glass ceiling which women are unable to break. It is not in womenтАЩs hand- they are active, mobilised, but there is a point beyond which is it hard for them to break the ceiling. This cap is held by the resources, funds, power, decision making consolidated in the hands of the patriarchs, who are at the assembly and parliament level. The system as it exists hasnтАЩt been fair in giving due representation to vulnerable of all categories тАУ indigenous, queer, tribal, dalit, women, young people etc. We need a complete revamp and overhaul of the system. Cynthia: The funds are devolved only upto the MLA level. The MLA becomes the most powerful person ( an arbitrator) and power is centralised. There is a constitutional mandate and an intent to distribute power to people. But the system is giving a backlash by providing a framework but simultaneously hollowing it out by drawing out all the resources and placing it in the hands of the elected males, and this is where money power seeps into politics. Cynthia: Traditionally, the property has always been owned by the male of the family. This is one of the major characteristics of patriarchy. Property goes from the father to the son. In the current times, some women who work on the farms of their husbands, only give their labour, and the system extracts her labour and surplus. Women are working, but men control the resources and make all the decisions. Hence, they command the reins in any industry where women are employed. From textile to agriculture. Women rarely climb to the powerful positions within the larger economic framework. The SHG network was different and truly empowered women in the beginning but then cracks began to show. Women started borrowing for family and ended up with the burden of loans. There is systemic subjugation, exploitation and extraction of women at every level. Their vote, labour, income, employment, womb, everything becomes the subject of exploitation. Cynthia: Reservation is not a disability. It is a safeguard for constitutional entitlement. The constitutional intention is to ensure equality, participation and representation. It was a strategy to ensure equitable representation in democratic institutions where the vulnerable were excluded. At least at the grassroots major part of the goal got achieved. In my opinion, it worked marvellously and wonderfully well, at least definitely in Karnataka. We have seen a lot of positive change. Initially, local power blocs, usually comprising of dominant caste males who desired to retain their position, tried to ensure that the wife of one of their Dalit supporters is put in the seat so that they can control her through the husband. Gradually, their establishment was challenged as reservation continued and women started coming to the forefront. Subsequently, women were trained by NGOs and government before and after the elections. An organisation like Mahila Samakhya, of which I was a part, were at the forefront of providing citizenship education and training to women from all categories, who continue to be active in their communities. Female human resources with governance experience are available at the grassroots. Some of these women who came on a reserved seat first time, later challenged a non-Dalit, man in the consecutive elections when the seat got un-reserved according to the rotation system. Cynthia: Privilege that dynasty brings to the family member of an existing politician is immense. And people naturalise and normalise it by citing examples that father who is a doctor, engineers will want his children to follow the same profession. It is completely intolerable and non-sensical to compare apples with the oranges. These fields are professional fields of endeavour. One to undergo lots of education, examinations, cut-off eligibility criteria and intensive course of training to follow in the footsteps of their parents. In politics, no such requirements are to be fulfilled. It is a feudal, regressive mindset which tries to justify their position through these theories which normalise dynasty. Patriarchy propagates hierarchy, lineage and transferring privilege to next-generation (usually males). As an activist, woman and a democrat, I do not condone such normalisation.As we see, traditionally, Dalits were not in a position of power, Dalit women barely have the advantage of dynastic inheritance. The issue is not with women. They are motivated enough. We have been concentrating our resources in equipping women, but I believe what we need to rather focus on building pressure groups which will push the government to bring reforms that will change the face of power and politics in India. There is a need to address the people in Election Commission, Supreme Court, within Political parties and all the constitutional authorities in a systemic manner.India may be numerically the largest democracy, but it is the most skewed and gender unbalanced and biased democracy in the world. This is a disgrace to us as a country. First is the issue of the dynasty, but second is more structural. In the first past the post system, candidates end up winning by thinnest margins. By a swing of a few hundred, the vote of the majority of the people in a constituency is rendered waste. In this system, who is the winner really? Who is the leader? The losers are the voters, certainly. We need to take a re-look at this system. Electoral funding is another major issue that needs to be challenged in the current times with increasing opacity. Organisations like NETRI must keep mobilising and training and supporting women but it has to be a two-pronged approach. We must build pressure from the outside too. Cynthia: Mainstream political parties do not want to encourage real people to contest. Though I am not unknown in Bangalore, none of the national parties was even giving time to listen to my application or hear out why I thought I was a worthy candidate? Parties had other considerations too. Instead of choosing to be an independent candidate, based on some suggestions, I decided to join a new party, and they offered me a ticket. But as it was not a national party ( also very new), I was asked to bring 10 proposers for my candidacy. National party candidates are required to get only 2 proposers. I see it as the establishmentтАЩs attempts to keep out the new challengers. But as I persisted, I would admit it was my inexperience and lack of resources required for filing a nomination for contesting at MP level. And the fact that I did not study the document process myself, that led to some mishap. At the last hour, the lawyers who I had relied upon for my filing backed out. On the day of the nomination I submitted my documents, I was given a few hours, which is a standard practice provided to catch up with any missing papers, as I was to submit my bank statement. I got back to them, not with 10 but 11 proposers, whose details and papers were also complete up to the mark and were to be submitted in a desired number of copies. At the last moment, the Election commission said, тАЬit should have been done yesterday, we cannot take it todayтАЭ. This is deliberate exclusion of the already excluded. These practices oppress the oppressed, keep them out of the system. It was injustice on the part of the election commission. A few other independent candidates filed an appeal against the EC in the court, I missed the opportunity of being a part of that delegation by a few hours. Although, it was a huge learning experience. And I hope all these experiences I shared add some constructive value to NETRIтАЩs future work.

1679,"Ex-IAS officer, dalit leader join hands to form new political party in Bihar","The Jan Sangharsh Dal seeks to represent dalits and Muslims Months before Assembly elections in Bihar, former bureaucrat Gulrez Hoda has joined forces with dalit leader Purnamasi Ram to launch a new political party, Jan Sangharsh Dal, which has been formed with the avowed purpose of giving a voice to the disempowered sections of the society in the highly inequitable political landscape of the state. The founders of the party say that it seeks to represent dalits, Muslims and the extremely backward castes as also progressive elements in the society who need and deserve an independent voice. тАЬA social coalition has to be formed to politically empower the marginalised sections of the society, like the Muslims and the dalits,тАЭ said Hoda, who is a former member of the Bihar State Planning Board and was also Director at The World Bank. The party is being promoted as a political initiative based on constitutional and fundamental rights of the people, and will focus on four main areasтАФeducation, security (policing), health and land management. Hoda said the formation of the new party was necessitated since the existing parties in Bihar have failed to provide the basic services to the people and are not in sync with their aspirations, having only treated them as vote banks. тАЬThe BJP's Hindutva agenda does not satisfy the basic aspirations of the people. The JD(U), which at one time was seen as an option by the marginalised sections, has lost its credibility by its association with the BJP and its double-pronged approach to CAA and NPR-NRC. On the other hand, the Congress is far placed from the realities on the ground. And the RJD is not the RJD of the old, with Lalu Yadav in jail, the leadership confusion in the party and the Yadavs emerging as the new empowered landlords,тАЭ said Hoda. He said the party will contest the coming Assembly elections and will field around 50-60 candidates. The party, whose sphere of activity has been the West Champaran area to begin with, is now branching out into other areas such as East Champaran, Seohar, Sitamarhi, Gopalganj, Siwan and Chapra. тАЬWe have got a very positive response from the people as we have moved around in three to four districts to gauge the mood of the people. We have an organisation up and running in West Champaran, where we have block presidents and we have had a membership drive at the Panchayat level. Also, the anti-CAA and anti-NPR movement has led to people looking at us as an option,тАЭ Hoda said. Purnamasi Ram, who is a five-time MLA from Bagaha, West Champaran, and has also represented Gopalganj in the Lok Sabha, is a recognised dalit leader. He has brought a big chunk of his supporters to the new party. тАЬWe are not a party formed just for the 2020 elections. We are hopeful that it will emerge as a political platform that will provide a viable option beyond 2020 to the marginalised and backward sections of the society as also the youth and the progressive-minded people,тАЭ Hoda said.

1682,"Bihar: Minor Dalit Girl Gang-Raped, Attempts Suicide and Dies, No Arrests So Far | NewsClick","INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Image Courtesy: iPleaders blog Patna: Two days after a minor Dalit girl, who was allegedly gang-raped in Bihar, died, police have failed to arrest the four named suspects in the case. The girl had tried to end her life but was rescued by her family. She succumbed to her injuries later. With the first of three phases of the Bihar Assembly Elections only 25 days away, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has instructed top police officials to tackle the incident to ensure that it did not become another Hathras. The state government fears protests by opposition parties and civil society, as has happened in neigbouring Uttar Pradesh. However, the state government has managed to keep the news out of the local media with information about the incident missing in print and TV coverage. A 14-year-old girl from a village in Konch, a community development block in Gaya district, was abducted by four youths when she was returning from a birthday party at a friendтАЩs house on September 29. They gang-raped her for hours. The victim was found in a semi-conscious state near the village the next morning by family members who brought her home. According to them, they looked for her late into the night after she failed to return home. When they asked her why she had not returned, she narrated the incident to them. тАЬShe was shaken and deeply pained while sharing the incident with us. She was also crying,тАЭ a member of her family said. Soon, she locked herself inside a room. The family initially thought she would open the door after a while. тАЬWhen an hour passed and she hadnтАЩt opened the door despite our repeated knocks, we sensed something was wrong, broke the door and found her hanging. Fortunately, she was alive and breathing. We immediately took her to a nearby private doctor who referred us to a hospital in Gaya. After her condition deteriorated, the hospital in Gaya advised us to shift her to a private hospital in Patna, where she died on October 1,тАЭ another family member said. According to the police, an autopsy was conducted at Gaya Medical College and its results are awaited. Afraid of being chastised in the village, her family did not approach the local police and decided not to lodge a complaint on September 30. Later, when she died and her body was cremated, an FIR was lodged against the four accused тАУ Chandan, Rahul, Tuntun тАУ based on a statement by the victimтАЩs mother. However, the police are denying that it was a case of rape. Sub-Divisional Police Officer Nagendar Singh told NewsClick that the allegations were untrue and that an investigation is on into the case. Konch police stationтАЩs officer in-charge, Prashant Kumar Singh, refused to talk about the case and said an investigation was ongoing. However, the assistant sub-inspector of the same police station, Saurav Kumar, told NewsClick that the accused, who are residents of the same village, were absconding after the incident. тАЬThe police will arrest them because raids are being conducted,тАЭ he said. Realising the gravity of the situation given the upcoming polls, Gaya Senior Superintendent of Police, Rajiv Mishra, visited the village on Friday, met her family and assured them of action against the accused and justice. Over the past 48 hours, three rape cases were reported in Bihar. A 12-year-old physically challenged girl was raped by a married man in a village Gaya. Later, the accused was caught by the villagers, who beat him up and handed them over to the police. On Thursday, a minor girl was gang-raped under Chainpur police station in Kaimur district. The three accused tried to kill her but she managed to survive. Local police have arrested two of the three named accused in the case. With Bihar CM Nitish Kumar hardly missing an opportunity to overstate the law-and-order situation in the state, the opposition is likely to raise it during campaigning.",1,3,1,3
1756,Case registered against MNS leader for threatening Dalit man,"A case has been registered against MNS leader Harshwardhan Jadhav for allegedly threatening a Dalit paan shop owner in Maharashtra's Aurangabad city, a police official said on Monday. The former MLA, however, blamed the Shiv Sena for the complaint against him. The complainant, Nitin Ratan Dabhade (30), told the police that he had set up a temporary paan (betel) booth in Krantinagar area of the city. Jadhav came there on Saturday and asked him to remove the booth. He also allegedly used rude words against Dabhade's religion and threatened to kill him, the official said quoting the complaint. A case has been registered by the Kranti Chowk police against Jadhav under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, he said. Jadhav, who earlier represented Kannad Assembly seat in Aurangabad district, resigned from the Shiv Sena in 2018 after being miffed with the party leadership over the issue of reservations for the Marathas, Dhangars and Muslims. He contested the last year's state Assembly polls as an Independent and lost to Uday Singh Rajput of the Shiv Sena. When contacted, Jadhav, who recently joined the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), alleged that the Shiv Sena was behind the complaint against him. """"The Shiv Sena is behind this complaint. I demanded removal of the booth and the police acted on it. The matter was over there. But, I later got to know that some Shiv Sena workers accompanied the complainant to the police station,"""" he said.

If she says she is using 'Dalit' word, then I'm also a Dalit woman.тАЭ Soon after the session in the Lok Sabha commenced at 2 pm on Monday, Opposition members started raising slogans from the Well against the government. The Lower House was adjourned three times till 4.30 pm as the ruckus continued. The Opposition members went into the section of the treasury benches carrying a black banner, and demanded Shah's resignation, as the Speaker took up the listed business. Parliamentary Affairs minister Pralhad Joshi condemned their """"unruly behaviour"""" and asked the Speaker to continue with normal business. Joshi alleged that """"these are the people"""" who have provoked the riots. """"They murdered 3,000 people in 1984 (riots) and did no investigation. The priority is to restore peace... but they want to create tension,"""" he said. Seeking to restore normalcy in the House, Birla asked Opposition members who were in the Well to take their seats even as they continued to shout the slogan тАШWe want justiceтАЩ. They were also holding placards saying """"Stop hate speech, save our India"""". Things took a turn for worse as Congress' Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu took a black banner to the Treasury benches where BJP's Sanjay Jaiswal was speaking on 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill. BJP members, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey, asked them to return to the Well. The charge by the Congress members angered BJP members, including many from back benches, who rushed towards the Congress members. Members from both sides then began pushing and shoving each other following which the proceedings were adjourned till 3 pm by the Speaker. Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani were seen trying to pacify the agitated members. Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi were present in the House during the uproar. When the House reassembled at 3 pm, some BJP members were seen blocking the way to their side of the Well. BJP's Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House again till 4 pm saying """"whatever you have done is wrong"""". But the ruckus continued when the House again met and it was adjourned till 4.30 pm by the Chair. However, the slogan-shouting by the BJP members continued. They chanted slogans like """"Desh ki raksha kaun karega, hum karenge hum karenge (Who will defend the nation, we will do it"""" and """"Mahatma Gandhi amar rahein, nakli Gandhi jail mein rahein (Long live Mahatama Gandhi, fake Gandhis stay in jail). Some Opposition members placed a placard demanding Shah's resignation on the Speaker's table but it was swiftly removed by the staff. Earlier, Birla asked leaders of Opposition parties to ensure that their members take their respective seats as the """"people of the country are watching (the proceedings)"""". """"This is the temple of democracy. There are certain rules and tradition. You should not come to the Well,"""" he said. Birla also said """"as you are responsible representatives of people here, it is your collective responsibility to maintain peace and tranquility.""""

1803,"Cong Says Govt Not Allowing Debate in Parliament on Delhi Riots, Alleges Assault on Dalit Woman MP","Speaker Om Birla conducts proceedings in the Lok Sabha during the Budget Session of Parliament in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI) New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused the government of not allowing a debate in Parliament on the issue of communal violence in Delhi, while also alleging that one of its Dalit MPs was assaulted by a BJP lawmaker. The opposition party said it will continue to protest in Parliament over the communal violence in Delhi as it is its duty to uncover the """"conspiracy"""" behind the riots. BJP and Congress members pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha on Monday as opposition parties vehemently protested over the issue of violence in Delhi and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. Speaking to reporters after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress' leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party demanded that the violence in Delhi be discussed in the Lower House of Parliament as it was a very important issue and the world was talking about it. The party demanded that there should be a debate on the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah participating as all Indians want it to happen, Chowdhury said. """"The government should put forward its views on it. We were trying to make this request, but the government did not allow us to do so and kept making one excuse after another,"""" he said. """"What is surprising is that when Delhi was burning, the ruling party thought that 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill should be brought. Without asking us, they started discussing the bill,"""" the Congress leader said. Chowdhury said """"democracy was torn to shreds"""" as the Opposition party was not allowed to air its views. """"The sad part is that a Dalit MP of our party from Kerala was assaulted by ruling party MP. She also started crying and said 'if this happens inside the House to Dalits what will happen outside',"""" he said. """"Our protest will continue. It is our duty to uncover who makes hate speeches, who indulge in killings and what is the conspiracy behind the violence,"""" Chowdhury said. Congress MP Ramya Haridas on Monday lodged a complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she was assaulted by BJP MP Jaskaur Meena inside the Lower House of Parliament and sought immediate action over the matter. Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that for three days riots continued unabated, but Union ministers did not make any statement and did not visit the riot-affected areas. """"Because of that police also did not act,"""" he said. """"The central government wanted that those who are dying, let them die and those who are being burnt alive, let it happen. Hate speeches were given by leaders of the ruling party which meant that the central government was behind the riots,"""" he alleged. All business in Parliament should be adjourned to discuss the issue of Delhi violence, Azad said.",1,3,1,3
1821,Dalit boy sustains injuries in attack,"A 15-year-old Dalit boy has sustained injuries after allegedly being attacked by a man at Ezhupunna in the district. The alleged incident happened last week. The Aroor police have registered a case against Gopi of Ezhupunna under Sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police said the Kerala High Court prevented GopiтАЩs arrest after he moved an anticipatory bail application on Thursday. As per a complaint filed by the parents of the victim, the boy, along with his friend, had gone to bathe in the pond of the Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu temple, Ezhupunna, following a disruption in the water supply on March 6. The victim was blocked from entering the pond by Gopi stating that people of the Dalit community should not take bath in the temple pond. He then released air from the tyre of the victimтАЩs bicycle. The boy questioned this and the accused beat him on his neck and punched him on the stomach. тАЬAfter getting information, I reached the spot and saw Gopi brutally assaulting my son and immediately took him to the Thuravoor taluk hospital. I came to know that Gopi used to scold and attack other children too. The incident has nothing to do with the temple committee,тАЭ said the father of the victim. After spending a couple of days at the hospital, the boy was discharged earlier this week to write the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination. The accused, a retired railway official, reportedly is of the Kudumbi caste. Sasi Kumar, secretary, Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu Temple Dewasom, said that the pond was opened to all irrespective of religion and caste. тАЬThe incident has nothing to do with the Devaswom. It was an issue between individuals. People from all religions use the pond. It will remain like that,тАЭ he said. Mr. Kumar added that the accused was not a member of the temple committee. The police investigation into the incident is led by Cherthala Deputy Superintendent of Police A.G. Lal.

Aurangabad, February 6 A 50-year old Dalit woman, who was set on fire by a neighbour after she resisted his move to enter her house here in Maharashtra, has died, a doctor said on Thursday. The woman, who suffered about 95 per cent burns in the incident that took place in Andhari village of Sillod tehsil on Sunday midnight, was undergoing treatment at a government medical college and hospital in Aurangabad city. """"She died around 10 pm on Wednesday,"""" the hospital's medical superintendent Suresh Harbade told PTI. The accused, Santosh Mohite (50), who knew the woman as he resided in her neighbourhood in Andhari village, was arrested on Tuesday, a police official said. As per the woman's statement given to police before death, she tried to push Mohite out of her house, but in vain. This led to a quarrel between them following which Mohite set her ablaze, Sillod (rural) police station's inspector Kiran Bidve said. """"The victim and the accused knew each other, and he used to come to her house. But, on Sunday when he came around midnight, the woman opposed it saying their meeting at that hour would defame her,"""" he said. However, despite her opposition, Mohite entered her house, and they had a fight, he said. """"During the quarrel, Mohite poured kerosene kept nearby on the woman and set her afire,"""" he added. The accused later locked the door from outside and ran away, the police said. On hearing the woman's screams, some of her relatives staying in the vicinity rushed to the place and took her to a local hospital, from where she was referred to the government hospital in Aurangabad city. The accused was earlier booked under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass with preparation for causing hurt to any person) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), but will now also be charged under 302 (murder), Bidve said. He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the official said. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jaleel demanded that the case be tried in a fast-track court for ensuring justice to the victim and her family. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader said he has demanded in Parliament that hearing be conducted in fast-track court in this case and that of a woman set on fire in Wardha district. A 25-year-old lecturer was set ablaze by a stalker in Wardha on Monday, leaving her critically injured. тАФ PTI Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

1988,"The day before Anand Teltumbde is to be arrested, he writes an open letter to the people of India","Support Scroll.in Support Scroll.in Your support is crucial: India needs independent media and independent media needs you.  On Monday, the day before writer and activist Anand Telbumbde is due to surrender to prison authorities for allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to foment violence between Dalits and Marathas on January 1, 2018, and to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he wrote an open letter to the people of India detailing how the authorities manufactured prejudice against him and others in the case. тАЬI have an unblemished record of service for nearly five decades to this country in various roles in corporate world, as a teacher, as a civil rights activist and a public intellectual...,тАЭ Teltumbde wrote. тАЬBut at the fag end of my life, I am being charged for the heinous crime under the draconian UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]. An individual like me obviously cannot counter the spirited propaganda of the government and its subservient media.тАЭ Nine other activists and lawyers have been in jail since 2018 and face trial for allegedly participating in the conspiracy. On April 8, the Supreme Court had given a weekтАЩs time to Teltumbde and rights activist Gautam Navlakha to surrender to prison authorities. They have been charged under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code following violence between Dalits and Marathas in the village of Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. The clashes came a day after an event in Pune, called the Elgar Parishad, had been organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 in which the Dalit soldiers fighting for the British Army had helped to defeat the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. One person died in violence during a bandh called by Dalit outfits on January 2. The Pune Police alleged that Teltumbde and Navlakha were among a group of people with Maoist links that had conspired to organise the violence and have also alleged that they plotted to kill Modi. The inquiry was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. Here is the full text of TeltumbeтАЩs letter. I am aware this may be completely drowned in the motivated cacophony of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh combine and the subservient media but I still think it may be worth talking to you as I do not know whether I would get another opportunity. Since August 2018, when the police raided my house in faculty housing complex of Goa Institute of Management, my world turned completely topsy-turvy. Never in my worst dream, could I imagine the things that began happening to me. Although, I was aware that police used to visit the organisers of my lectures, mostly universities, and scare them with enquiries about me, I thought they might be mistaking me for my brother who left family years back. While I was teaching at IIT Kharagpur, an officer of BSNL phoned, introducing himself as my admirer and well-wisher, informed me that my phone was being tapped. I thanked him but did nothing, not even to change my SIM. I was disturbed by these intrusions but comforted myself that it might rather convince the police that I was a normal person and there is no element of illegality in my conduct. The police generally dislike civil rights activists because they question the police. I imagined, it might be due to the fact that I belonged to that tribe. But again I comforted myself that they would find that I could not perform that role either because of my full-time engagement with my job. But when I got an early morning phone call from the director of my institute, informing me that the police had raided the campus and were looking for me, I was wordless for a few seconds. I had come to Mumbai on official work just a few hours before and my wife had come earlier. When I learnt of the arrests, of the persons whose houses were raided that day, I was shaken by the realisation that I escaped that fate just by whiskers. The police did know my whereabouts and could arrest me even then but for the reasons known only to them, did not do so. They did open our house too, forcibly getting a duplicate key from the security guard, but just video-graphed it and locked it back. Our ordeal began right there. At the advice of our lawyers, my wife took the next available flight to Goa, and lodged a complaint with Bicholim Police Station that the police had opened our house in our absence and that we would not be responsible if they had planted anything. She volunteered giving our telephone numbers should the police want to inquire with us. Strangely,the police had started holding press conferences soon after they embarked on the Maoist story. It was clearly meant to whip up prejudice in public against me and other arrested with the help of obliging media. On August 31, 2018, in one such press conference, a police officer read out a letter purportedly recovered from the computer of previous arrestees as an evidence against me. The letter was clumsily constructed with the information on the academic conference I had attended which was easily available on the website of American University of Paris. Initially I laughed it out but next, decided to file a civil and criminal defamation suit against this officer and sent a letter on September 5, 2018 to the government of Maharashtra for sanction as per the procedure. There has been no response from the government to date. The press conferences of the police, however, were stopped when High Court reprimanded them. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh hand in the entire case was not hidden. My friends told me that one of their functionaries, Ramesh Patange, had written an article in their mouthpiece Panchjanya targeting me in April 2015. I was identified as тАЬMayavi AmbedkarwadiтАЭ along with Arundhati Roy and Gail Omvedt. Mayavi in the Hindu mythology refers to a demon meant to be destroyed. When I was illegally arrested by Pune Police while still under protection of the Supreme Court, a cyber-gang of Hindutva vandalised my Wikimedia page. This page is a public page and for years I was not even aware of it. They firstly deleted all information and only wrote, тАЬHe has a Maoist brotherтАж his house was raided тАж he was arrested for links with MaoistтАЭ, etc. Some students later told me that whenever they tried restoring the page, or editing the page, this gang would pounce upon and delete everything and put up derogatory content. Ultimately, Wikimedia intervened and the page stabilised with some of their negative content. There was a media blitzkrieg, reeling off all kinds of canards through the RSSтАЩs so-called Naxal experts. My complaints against the channels and even to the India Broadcasting Foundation did not receive a response. Then in October 2019, the Pegasus story came out that the government had inserted a very pernicious Israeli spyware on my phone, among those of several others. There was a momentary uproar in media but this serious matter also has died. I have been a simple person who has been earning his bread honestly and helping people to the extent possible with my knowledge through writings. I have an unblemished record of service for nearly five decades to this country in various roles in corporate world, as a teacher, as a civil rights activist and a public intellectual. In my voluminous writings comprising over 30 books, and numerous papers/articles/comments/columns/interviews, published internationally, not an insinuation of support to violence or any subversive movement could be found. But at the fag end of my life, I am being charged for the heinous crime under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. An individual like me obviously cannot counter the spirited propaganda of the government and its subservient media. The details of the case are strewn across the internet and are enough for any person to see that it is a clumsy and criminal fabrication. A summary note on All India Forum for the Right to Education website may be read. For your benefit, I will provide its gist here: I am implicated on the basis of the five letters among the 13 that the police purportedly recovered from the computers of two arrestees in the case. Nothing has been recovered from me. The letter make reference to тАЬAnandтАЭ, a common name in India, but the police unquestioningly identified it with me. Notwithstanding the form and content of these letters, which was trashed by experts and even by a justice in Supreme Court, who was the only one in the entire judiciary who went into the nature of the evidence. the content does not refer to anything that could be remotely construed as even a simple crime. But taking shelter under the draconian provisions of the UAPA Act, which renders a person defenceless, I am being jailed. The case may be depicted for your understanding as follows: suddenly, a police posse descends down on your residence and ransacks your house without showing any warrant. At the end, they arrest you and lodge in the police lockup. In the court, they would say that while investigating a theft (or any other complaint) case in xxx place (substitute any place in India) police recovered a pen drive or a computer from yyy (substitute any name) in which some letters written by a supposed member of some banned organisation were recovered that had a mention of zzz who according to the police is none other than you. They present you as part of deep conspiracy. Suddenly, you find your world turned topsy-turvy. Your job gone, family losing house, media defaming you about which you cannot do a damn thing. Police will produce тАЬsealed envelopesтАЭ to convince judges that there was a prima facie case against you that needs custodial interrogation. No arguments about there being no evidence would be entertained as judges would answer that it would be seen in trial. After custodial interrogation, you will be sent to jail. You beg for bail and the courts will reject them as the historical data shows that the average period of incarceration ranged from four to 10 years before they got bail or acquitted. And this can happen literally to ANYONE. In the name of the тАЬnationтАЭ, such draconian legislations that denude innocent people of their liberties and all constitutional rights are constitutionally validated. The jingoist nation and nationalism have got weaponised by the political class to destroy dissent and polarise people. The mass frenzy has accomplished complete derationalisation and inversion of meanings where destroyers of the nation become deshbhakts and selfless servers of people become deshdrohis. As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim moment. Well, I am off to National Investigative Agency custody and do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes.

2020,Coronovirus Lockdown : Another Migrant Dalit Labour Commits Suicide,"Roshan Lal, a 22-year-old migrant worker, committed suicide on Wednesday after he was allegedly humiliated and beaten up by the UP police for breaking quarantine rules. A report by GroundXero.   тАЬHello Namaskar friends, my name is Roshan Lal. I am very upset today. My only fault is that I stepped out (of the school where he was put in quarantine) to get flour because we did not have anything at my home to eat. A policeman named Anoop Singh has thrashed me so badly that my right hand has stopped working. Perhaps, it is broken now. DonтАЩt ask how helpless I am feeling right now.тАЭ   тАЬDespite this, nobody came forward to help me that is why I am taking this extreme step.тАЭ   The testimony above has been transcribed from the three recorded audio clips which Roshan Lal, a migrant worker, forwarded to his friend and family members on WhatsApp, minutes before he took the тАЬextreme stepтАЭ of killing himself by hanging. Roshal Lal body was found hanging from a tree in the school campus, where he was quarantined.  Roshan Lal was a22 year old dalit youth,who worked as a daily wage labourer in Gurgaon. He had returned to his native village, Pipariya under Maigalganj police station, on March 29, six days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown, and was kept in a local school under quarantine by village officials. He committed suicide on Wednesday, after he was allegedly humiliated and brutally beaten up by the UP police for breaking quarantine rules.  In one of the audio clips, Roshan Lal can be heard saying,  тАЬMy only fault is that I came back from Gurgaon two days ago. My mistake is that I was sitting in the school when I got a call that there was no food at home. My sister-in-law asked me to get some wheat grounded. And I went. That was my mistake тАУ I should have stayed in the school. After that, a constable named Anoop came there and asked if I am Roshan. I said yes. He beat me up severely. My right hand is not working. Then he made me speak to the chowki in-charge. I asked him to help me get treated. He did not help me.тАЭ  In another audio clip, Roshan Lal can be heard saying:  тАЬFriends, if there is anyone who does not believe me, they should see my pants. There is only blood. I donтАЩt want to live now. Action should be taken against constable Anoop Kumar Singh. Because of him, I am killing myself.тАЭ  RoshanтАЩs elder brother Bankey Lal narrated how his brother managed to reach the village. Bankey Lal said, тАЬHe [Roshan Lal] had to walk from Gurgaon till AnandVihar. From there, he boarded a bus to Lucknow. From Lucknow, he hitched rides before walking for the last-mile journey.тАЭ  The family members and villagers staged a protest and refused to cremate the body until a case was lodged against the constable. Bankey Lal said, the police had refused to lodge an FIR against the constable. He added, тАЬJust because we are poor doesnтАЩt mean we can be humiliated in the village and nothing will happen to those who are responsible for doing this.тАЭ  A senior police officer in the district said Roshan refused to follow quarantine norms. тАЬHe was roaming around. That is why he was stopped and maybe, he was slapped a couple of times by the constable,тАЭ Lucknow Range Inspector General S K Bhagat said an inquiry had been ordered and action would be taken on the basis of its findings within 48 hours.  Roshan LalтАЩs story, by no means, is an isolated incident. By now, most of us have seen the photographs and videos of the migrant workers being humiliated across the country by security forces as they trek miles along the highways to reach their homes. To us they are the nameless, faceless multitude тАУ the carriers of the dreaded virus. They are the тАШvectorтАЩ.  Roshan Lal provides us with a name and a face to this narrative. His story is also one of habitual public humiliation faced by millions at the hands of the state тАУ actualized by the police тАУ and the middle-class civil society. Class exacerbates such instances of humiliation. Caste intensifies it. The two combine together to create a circuit of public humiliation, which lies beyond the imagination of those of us who are participating in тАЬsari challengesтАЭ and тАЬquarantine cookingтАЭ on social media during the days of the lockdown.  We have more or less maintained тАШsocial distancingтАЩ from the likes of Roshan Lal. This lockdown and the fear of the virus reaching us have forced us to take notice of them. We wanted them to be locked and quarantined, but in a more тАЬhumaneтАЭ way. But, the visuals of their helplessness,public humiliation and plight haveindeed disturbed our sanitized morality, as theyhave trickled down our social media feeds. Yet, such visuals did not disturb our everyday material existences in anyway. At a time, when тАЬsolidarityтАЭ and тАЬempathyтАЭ have become buzzwords in our social media posts, we did not even try to understand the ways in which such instances of public humiliation create long-standing trauma in those who have to go through them, let alone reach out to them. Because, after all, individuals like Roshan Lal are, for us, mere bodies тАФ the invisible laboring bodies which provide us with the essential goods and services. And, obviously, dispensable. That is why, other than their capacity to perform labour, their stories do not matter.  Roshan Lal took us by our throats to challenge that invisibility. He forced us to see, how behind every instance of public humiliation by the police, there is a bruised, traumatized human ego and self. Yet, what does it say about us, as a society, when in order to communicate to us that every poor dalit youth has a sense of self, he had to kill himself? In our neoliberalized world, where words such as тАЬtraumaтАЭ and тАЬPTSDтАЭ have become much over-used and abused buzzwords amongst a certain section of middle-class youth, what does Roshan LalтАЩs тАЬtraumaтАЭ mean? How we are to take into account his trauma, and those of millions like him, as a society? The truth is, in an inequality-ridden casteist, classistsociety like ours, even our notions of trauma must exist in conflict with each other. The truth is, there is no universal understanding of trauma anywhere beyond the inequalities engendered by class, caste, race and gender.  In a couple of days, as we, the obedient citizens, paying heed to the call of the Pied Piper will stand on our balconies, with candles in our hands to ward off the evil virus, the last words of Roshan Lal and Aldrin Lyndog тАУ the marginalized youths тАУ who were forced to take their lives during this lockdown, will come to haunt us.

2024,Jesuits provide food for Dalit communities in India - Vatican News,"By Fr. Benedict Mayaki, SJ A Jesuit apostolate in the Indian State of Bihar is working in collaboration with a government agency to provide food for thousands of poor people, especially the most disadvantaged among the Dalit communities during the imposed coronavirus lockdown period in India. Manthan, a Jesuit social action center involved in working with the Dalit or тАШuntouchablesтАЩ in the Hindu caste system, provided food parcels to about 5,000 poor people in Patna, the state capital. They also distributed foodstuff to widows, the elderly and the sick. Fr. Juno Sebastian SJ, the director of Manthan, said that this initiative came about after he was contacted by many people who said that they had not eaten for days. He immediately got in contact with officials of the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) who agreed to support his idea to feed the poor. тАЬNow we are distributing cooked meals to 1,500 of them daily, and we will continue until the end of the isolation. We are also working to help 6,500 Musahar families in Patna, for a total of about 40,000 people,тАЭ Fr. Sebastian said. The distribution of food takes place in the slums and villages where the Jesuit Provincial of the Patna Province, Father Donald Miranda, SJ, said that they have managed to reach 700 other families. It has also been extended to parts of Uttar Pradesh where about 3,000 families are also able to be fed daily. The Jesuit College of St. Xavier in Patna is also involved in distributing food to about 530 families in the area. Even though the Bihar state government distributes food to the people free of charge, many Dalits do not have access to it because they have no documents to prove where they live or their identity. On 24 March, the Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown as part of precautionary measures to stem the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The lockdown has been hard on the poor and the vulnerable especially the Dalit communities, who are predominantly menial workers in the suburbs of Patna, the capital of Bihar. India presently has 18,658 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections with 592 deaths and 3,273 recovered patients. Pope's Activities Our Faith Useful Information Other sites Our channels",0,0,1,3

The man was identified as Seraj Ahmad, a native of Bhujouli Khurd village of the district. He and four others are lodged at a quarantine centre set up in a primary school in the village, they said. Ahmad returned to the village from Delhi on March 29 and has been in quarantine at the centre, the police said. On April 10, the village head, Lilawati Devi, who is a Dalit, went to the quarantine centre and prepared food for the five people lodged there as the cook was absent. However, Ahmad refused to have the food cooked by her, they said. Later, Devi informed Sub-Divisional Magistrate Deshdeepak Singh and Block Development Officer Ramakant about the incident. She lodged a police complaint on Sunday, they added. Station House Officer (SHO) Khadda police station RK Yadav said a case has been filed against Ahmad under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

2075,"Bhima Koregaon case: Dalit leaders, Amnesty condemn SC order on arrests of Teltumbde, Navlakha","Support Scroll.in Support Scroll.in Your support is crucial: India needs independent media and independent media needs you.  Several Dalit leaders, including MPs and MLAs, issued a statement on Monday calling the imminent arrest of activist Anand Teltumbde in the Bhima Koregaon case a тАЬnational shameтАЭ. On April 8, the Supreme Court had given a weekтАЩs time to Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha to surrender to prison authorities. The order came after the court had rejected their anticipatory bail pleas last month. The counsel for the activists had argued that they are over 65 years old with pre-existing medical conditions, adding that they should be granted more time to surrender. тАЬGoing to jail at the time of the Covid-19 virus is virtually a death sentence,тАЭ the lawyer had said. However, the top court refused to budge. On Monday, the Dalit leaders, which included Communist Party of India General Secretary D Raja, Independent Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Congress leader and former MP Udit Raj and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief Prakash Ambedkar among others, said that Teltumbde will surrender on April 14, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar. They described the surrender of Teltumbde and Navlakha on the same day as тАЬshameful for Dalits, Adivasis, OBCs [Other Backward Castes] and minorities on many counts for all of IndiaтАЭ. The signatories accused the Centre of trying to тАЬcrush the spirit that kept the flame of democracy alive in our midstтАЭ and added that even extremely repressive regimes were releasing political prisoners in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The statement added that the arrest would be an тАЬobnoxious warning of the casteist Manuvadi regime to Dalit, Adivasi, OBC and minority intellectuals not to raise their voices of protestтАЭ. They said TeltumbdeтАЩs arrest revealed IndiaтАЩs тАЬentrenched casteismтАЭ. The Dalit leaders called on the Dalit, OBC, Adivasi and minority leadership to тАЬstand and seek justiceтАЭ for TeltumbdeтАЩs freedom of expression. They asked the public to unite in the name of Ambedkar. Violence broke out between Dalits and Marathas in the village of Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. This came a day after an event in Pune, called the Elgar Parishad, was organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 in which the Dalit soldiers fighting for the British Army defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. One person died in violence during a bandh called by Dalit outfits on January 2. Navlakha and Teltumbde were charged under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code following the violence at Bhima Koregaon village. The case made by the Pune Police alleged they had Maoist links, and the inquiry was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. Meanwhile, the petitioners in the Bhima Koregaon case wrote an open letter to Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde, alleging that even though 18 months had passed since activists Varavara Rao, Arun Fereira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha had been arrested, the prosecution had failed to produce any new facts or evidence to support its case. тАЬDespite this, not only have the accused been denied bail and deprived of their liberty, but two new names have been added to their ranks,тАЭ the petitioners said. The petitioners тАУ historian Romila Thapar, Prabhat Patnaik, Devaki Jain, Maja Daruwala and Satish Deshpande reminded the Supreme Court that it had in 2018 ruled against the plea for a Special Investigation Team probe in the case, saying the inquiry was at an early stage. тАЬLike all fair-minded citizens, we are shocked that the prosecution has not been held accountable to the spirit of the law,тАЭ the petitioners wrote. тАЬWe are anguished that our courts have condoned the continued imprisonment of those who have dared to defend the rights of voiceless and marginalised people, and are now allowing this vindictive campaign to be expanded. This is especially inhuman and incomprehensible at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is threatening our overcrowded jails.тАЭ The petitioners urged the chief justice to defend the Constitution and uphold the human rights of the accused through a тАЬpositive interventionтАЭ in the matter. Global human rights watchdog Amnesty International condemned the Supreme CourtтАЩs order directing that Teltumbde and Navlakha be arrested and imprisoned within a week, calling it тАЬcruel and disappointingтАЭ. тАЬOn one hand, the court acknowledges that overcrowded prisons present a serious threat and recommends the release of prisoners during the pandemic and then it directs two activists who have been critical of the government to surrender before the police and to be sent to jail,тАЭ Amnesty International India Executive Director Avinash Kumar said. Amnesty International said Teltumbde and Navlakha have a history of working for the poor and the marginalised sections. тАЬAmnesty India believes that the impending arrests of the two, along with the arrests of the nine activists in the Bhima Koregaon case in 2018, are politically motivated actions that are aimed at chilling peaceful dissent,тАЭ it added. Earlier this month, more than 5,000 individuals and over 15 organisations around the world had urged the Centre to delay Teltumbde and NavlakhaтАЩs arrest.",1,1,1,3
2081,The Rise And The Fall Of Dalit Journalism In India | Feminism In India,"EditorтАЩs Note: This month, that is April 2020, FIIтАЩs #MoodOfTheMonth is Dalit History, where we invite various articles about historical moments in Dalit movements as well as Dalits in history who have been part of the anti-caste movement in India.. If youтАЩd like to share your write ups, email us at pragya@feminisminindia.com. The period of 1920s till late 1940s saw the upsurge in nationalist movement. The period also saw a rise in anti-caste movements within the nationalist movement. The 1920s were radically transformative decade for the Dalit mass movements in India. Dalit grievances were transforming into an effective political and organisational structure thus shaping Dalit mass politics during the period. The rise of Dalit journalism is seen since 1920s as mainstream media refused to speak about the struggles of the oppressed. With Mahad agitation of 1927 a series of assertive and affirmative mass politics unfolded. The agitation was a visible example of how Dalits had been deprived from public spaces and perpetually subjected to the upper caste violence. The aftermath of Mahad agitation gave the demand of Dalits to be identified separately from the Hindus because there was almost no social cohesion between them and the dominant Brahminical ideology. The question of violence became central in the public sphere as well as the need to have a тАШmouthpieceтАЩ to mobilise public opinions, and leaders like Dr. Ambedkar believed on newspapers to bring about a change in the lives of the oppressed classes. The rise of Dalit journalism is also seen since 1920s as mainstream media refused to speak about the struggles of the oppressed. With Mahad agitation of 1927 a series of assertive and affirmative mass politics unfolded. The agitation was a visible example of how Dalits had been deprived from public spaces and perpetually subjected to the upper caste violence. The leaders knew that mainstream mass media would reflect traditional caste ideology, and hence, there was a need to have a separate media altogether. Thus, the very first newspaper catering to the oppressed classes was тАШMooknayakтАШ, on January 31, 1920. It ran for three years and in 1927, and then тАШBahishkrut BharatтАШ was founded. During the 1920s, Mooknayak and Bahishkrut Bharat took bold positions on several contentious issues pertaining to religion, society and politics. As Bahishkrut Bharat was established as a product of powerful mass agitation during the Mahad Satyagraha in 1927, it later became the mouthpiece of the Ambedkar-led Bahishkrut Hitkarni Sabha. The name of newspapers posed a satire on the prevailing structure of society like the тАШMooknayakтАШ which literally meant тАШleader of the voicelessтАЩ and Bahishkrut Bharat meaning тАШExcluded IndiaтАЩ. The title of Bahishkrut Bharat was proposed during a meeting held at Bombay being presided by Dr. Ambedkar. The newspapers were a collective effort of propagating information and form a mouth piece. It received funding from Dalit activists of Konkan and Bombay who weтАЩre participating in the Mahad agitations. Meanwhile, Dr. Ambedkar was involved in writing the reports, commentaries and editorials. These newspapers thus were very important in mobilising the opinion against caste violence in the late 1920s. The important editorials written by Dr. Ambedkar were read publicly in Dalit gatherings and helped in mobilising of Dalits in Western India. In Bahishkrut Bharat, emphasis was laid on the incapability of Hindu society to realise basic social norms and absence of social affinity within caste structure. Various editorials, news reports and testimonies were published on violence against Dalits in western India. Different problems of society and divisions of caste were often criticised in the writings of the papers. They also strongly questioned the Congress and right-wing Hindu nationalists for their indifference and ignorance to the question of caste. Also read: Why Dalit WomenтАЩs Contribution Needs Assertion Today Dr. Ambedkar in one of the editorials argued that a nationalist ideology cannot withstand on the notions of ignorance towards caste. He emphasised on the absence of opportunities for individuals to intermix with another which is harmful to national unity. As a result, there are indifferences, hierarchy and violence with no scope for genuine national unity. With the onset of Dalit mass politics in late 1920s, the mainstream media and the alternative press of oppressed became opposite to each other. During the second round table conference when separate electorates and double vote for the depressed classes were announced, the Congress, the press and the mainstream media condemned Dr. Ambedkar for it. These newspapers thus were very important in mobilising the opinion against caste violence in the late 1920s. The important editorials written by Dr. Ambedkar were read publicly in Dalit gatherings and helped in mobilising of Dalits in Western India. Mainstream media had clearly defined its side on who constitutes what and shaped a huge public opinion and mass politics. For the press, the Congress symbolised nationalism and national unity and there was a clear distinction among editors about what constituted nationalism and consequently, тАШIndianтАЩ politics. Thus what was тАШanti nationalтАЩ or тАШcommunalтАЩ politics was categorised very systematically. Dalit non-violent protests were never seen as Satyagraha. The Mahad struggle and the Nasik temple entry movement were not considered as Satyagraha by the mainstream media but an attack on social fabric of the country. Thus, the newspapers presented an alternative space and ideas against the dominant hegemonic ideology. However, during the anti-caste struggle and for this alternative view the mainstream media portrayed the anti-caste leaders as тАШtraitorsтАЩ or тАШdividersтАЩ of the coherent national space. Media played a significant role in the movement and saw emergence of alternative media as a form of protest from the dominant mainstream to put the тАШsilencedтАЩ or тАШunheardтАЩ narrative. Study of media of today reveals the same distribution of power within media industry as of those times and the biased or ignored coverage or reports of caste violence. Even after almost 100 years after the first Dalit newspaper was published to this day newsrooms of the mainstream media are dominated by upper caste men. The power structure of media is still the same and thus the mammoth problems are left unnoticed and uncared for by the mainstream media. Also read: The Search For Caste Solidarity: Dalit Women In India And Nepal There is immense potential in the internet to give power to the marginalised communities to have their own media to speak and discuss the issues concerning them freely and openly. Although the forms of alternative media like Veli Vada, Round Table India, Dalit Camera, etc. are changing with increasing participation from the Dalit community but the purpose to stand at par with the mainstream media and offer a counter-hegemonic representation is similar to what it was during the traditional media of newspapers. Apart from change in the medium, the content and the principles are same. Featured Image Source: Velivada Follow FII channels on Youtube and Telegram for latest updates.

Photo Credit: Neha Dixit Recommending sacking of UP CM Yogi Adityanath and international inquiry into the Hathras gangrape case, over 30 feminist groups, Dalit organisations and many other diaspora organisations from the UK, along with MPs John McDonnell, Apsana Begum, Kim Johnson, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, and Paula Barker, have written to UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet. The letter asks Bachelet to appeal to Indian PM Modi to dismiss the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. It says, тАЬ[I]n 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to IndiaтАЩs annual National Crime Record BureauтАЩs тАЬCrime in IndiaтАЭ 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits - 26% of all cases reported.тАЭ The groups express concern over the increased attacks on women and Dalits under the тАЬHindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideologyтАЭ, and say: тАЬThree other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim's remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur, a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered - rape is suspected - and in Azamgarh, an 8-year-old girl was raped.тАЭ Read the full text of the letter below: Dear Ms Bachelet We are writing to you to express our deep sense of shock and dismay at the terrible events unfolding in Uttar Pradesh, India and to urge you to take action as outlined below. Recent events On 14th September a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and assaulted with inhuman violence in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Her spine was broken, paralysing all her limbs, her body grievously bruised and her tongue was brutally wounded. The four men who had raped and assaulted her were oppressor caste Thakurs who dominated the village she lived in - a place which continues to practice тАШuntouchabilityтАЩ. They had allegedly been ruthlessly harassing her for a considerable length of time, to the extent that she was afraid of leaving her home. But worse was to come. The UP police, initially reluctant to register a case against the four accused, left her lying on the concrete floor of the police station and when she was eventually taken to a hospital she was left in a generic ward. Only after pressure built up was she transferred to the ICU and later to DelhiтАЩs Safdarjung Hospital, where she passed away on 29th September. But even this scale of cruelty was not enough for the police and administration of UP and the local government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath which gives them their orders. On the night of 30th September, they took away her dead body. Her motherтАЩs pleas to be allowed one last look at her were ignored. Then, barricading her family in their house so they could not attend or perform funeral rites, the police forcibly and hurriedly cremated her body at 2:30 am to erase all evidence in the case. Not isolated events What is most shocking is that far from being an isolated crime, this is part of a systematic attack on women and oppressed castes. Three other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim's remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered - rape is suspected - and in Azamgarh an 8-year-old girl was raped. While attacks on Dalits and women have escalated vastly all over India since 2014, when the Hindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideology came to power, the Adityanath government in UP has seen by far the largest number of attacks and atrocities. For example, in 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to IndiaтАЩs annual National Crime Record BureauтАЩs тАЬCrime in IndiaтАЭ 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits - 26% of all cases reported. We are deeply concerned about where this is leading India and more specifically the state of Uttar Pradesh. We hope you are able to take action: Urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dismiss Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Set up an international enquiry into the Hathras rape case and other rapes and crimes against women, particularly Dalit and oppressed caste women in UP since the Adityanath government came to power in the state.

2108,Dalit shahirs of Maharashtra: Sambhaji Bhagat takes Ambedkar to the world - Firstpost,"An introduction: MaharashtraтАЩs tradition of тАШshahiriтАЩ is several centuries old. In the last few decades of the 18th century, under the influence of Mahatma PhuleтАЩs Satyashodhak Samaj, it was transformed into a musical weapon of the masses, against the caste system. By the 1930s, the тАШSatyashodhaki jalsaтАЩ was in decline, but a powerful new force had emerged in its place: тАШAmbedkari jalsaтАЩ. Ambedkari jalsa represented the teachings and philosophy of Dr BR Ambedkar in oral form, accompanied by songs. Over a journey that is close to completing a century, many Ambedkarite shahirs have helped hone shahiri as an anti-caste tool. This series on MaharashtraтАЩs shahirs explores the lives and work of 15 greats. This is part thirteen of the series. тАФ Art by Satwick Gade *** Sambhaji Bhagat needs no introduction. Among the shahirs of the past and present, he is the most discussed by the Marathi and English media. At a time when technology has enabled the propagation of Brahminical values at a mass scale, he continues to perform in slums and neglected neighbourhoods across Maharashtra. He is the voice of the anti-caste conscience. Because his ideological standpoint is Ambedkarism, his work has widened the horizons of Dalit art. His music enabled the people to understand the complexities of oppression in a simplified manner. Sambhaji's work is the result of and an example of the intersection of music and ideology, thus making it an educative tool тАФ even for upper caste people whose worldview is coloured by caste-based prejudice. For him, there is no separation between art and politics; in fact, as a shahir, his art is his politics. Born on 1 June, 1959 in the district of Satara, his perspective towards using music for a cause was shaped by listening to Dalit artists. However, it was only in 1979 when he came to Mumbai to study that he was initiated into the тАШpolitics of artтАЩ. He had the songs; Mumbai nurtured his vision. Initially, he was exposed to leftist politics, and later, to the Ambedkarite movement. This time period marked the decline of the Dalit Panthers and the rise of the Namantar Movement. It was a time of intellectual churning, and many shahirs had to re-think their approach towards art. With this realisation, Sambhaji Bhagat went back to the basics of Ambedkari jalsa: Shahiri should reach the last man, the most marginalised, in the society. After spending a year in the city, he was witness to members of the Avhan Natya Manch (of which Shahir Vilas Ghogare was also a member) performing a street play in Churchgate on a humid day. He was thrilled at the performance; for him, it was not just a cultural phenomenon but also profoundly political. Though he is a playwright and writer too, he is an Ambedkari lokashahir first and foremost. The purpose of his shahiri is the creation a society where people are treated equally тАФ a Prabuddha Bharat тАФ and have basic rights and liberties; where people will interact with each other respectfully. His words have also helped to heal wounds. Through the course of his impactful career, he has written powadas, bharuds, plays, songs, poems, and an autobiography. The Marathi play Shivaji Underground in Bhimnagar Mohalla, which has received an excellent response тАФ full houses across the year тАФ was originally conceptualised by him. He also wrote the songs and composed the music for it. The play is historic, because it is a retelling of the original story of Shivaji, which was appropriated by right-wing political outfits in Maharashtra. As a departure from what previous Ambedkari shahirs had done in their careers, he also wrote songs and sang them for a Marathi movie, Nagrik. He was instrumental in the making of the movie Court, which won a National Film Award in 2015. Though the story is told from an upper caste location, the fact that he and his music in the movie stand for the anti-caste movement is still evident. When writing about him, many savarna writers and journalists have often reduced him to labels тАФ тАШDalit artistтАЩ or тАШDalit singerтАЩ тАФ never according him the recognition that they would give to non-Dalit artists. In a conversation I had with him in 2015 (which was published in Roundtable India), he told me: тАЬPost-modernism is eroding the significance of ideology... What we must do? We should not interfere in the work others are doing. People must be engaged in creative endeavours... People criticise me, but I respond to them through my plays, songs, poetry, and through my art.тАЭ  *** Also read parts one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and twelve of this series.

2109,Happy Mahatma Phule Jayanthi to all!,"Sign in Dalit History Month Apr 11, 2020┬╖2 min read Today in #Dalithistory, in honour of Mahatma Phule Jayanthi, we dedicate our post to Jyotirao Phule тАФ an activist, a thinker, and a social revolutionary of the nineteenth century. While he was of Shudra background, his ideas, work and actions have had an invaluable liberatory impact on Dalits. Born in 1827 before the widespread Adi-movements, Phule was the first to propound caste as subjugation and oppression on indigenous peoples by invaders. He stressed that caste was equivalent to slavery, as vicious and brutal as the enslavement of Africans in the Americas and unique in its deception and religious sanction. In his revolutionary book, Gulamgiri (Slavery) published in 1873, Jyotirao included a manifesto which amongst other things declared that he was willing to dine with all regardless of their caste, creed or country of origin and that social salvation was to be found only in the education of women and Dalits. This content was deemed extremely controversial at the time and several newspapers blatantly refused to publicize it. He believed that Shudras were a group of people who had suffered added repression and persecution because they had at one time been actively engaged in fighting invading Brahmanism on the ground. His salvation describes the unity of the Shudras and Adi-Shudras (Dalits) into one exploited mass of people rising up in powerful political unity. He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, became pioneers of womenтАЩs education in India, and together started the first school for girls on January 1st 1848 at BhideтАЩs wada in Pune.

Like many anti-caste revolutionaries, he felt a strong need to establish an alternative religion to the one that was oppressing his people.

2131,Dalit shahirs of Maharashtra: Arjun Hari Bhalerao's perseverance amid adversity - Firstpost,"An introduction: MaharashtraтАЩs tradition of тАШshahiriтАЩ is several centuries old. In the last few decades of the 18th century, under the influence of Mahatma PhuleтАЩs Satyashodhak Samaj, it was transformed into a musical weapon of the masses, against the caste system. By the 1930s, the тАШSatyashodhaki jalsaтАЩ was in decline, but a powerful new force had emerged in its place: тАШAmbedkari jalsaтАЩ. Ambedkari jalsa represented the teachings and philosophy of Dr BR Ambedkar in oral form, accompanied by songs. Over a journey that is close to completing a century, many Ambedkarite shahirs have helped hone shahiri as an anti-caste tool. This series on MaharashtraтАЩs shahirs explores the lives and work of 15 greats. This is part ten of the series. тАФ Art by Satwick Gade *** With the arrival of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar into the social and political life of India in the 1920s, the cultural politics of the country too, changed incredibly. Not only did he become the influence behind new, emerging narratives, but his ideas were also central to determining the anatomy of various art forms, whether it was the literature, the music or the shahiri that Dalits would go on to create. The ideas put forth by Dr Ambedkar find a great presence in the life and work of Shahir Arjun Hari Bhalerao. The story of his jalsa, which features the тАШAmbedkari Jalsa TadwalkaranchaтАЩ created by him, is a prominent example of how, in the wake of Ambedkar's anti-caste movement, music by Dalits imagined a humanitarian world for us тАФ an idea which was missing in a world where the gruesome practice of untouchability was (and still is) prevalent. Born on 1 December 1904, Arjun Hari Bhalerao grew up in a family of shahirs. During the 1920s, his uncle Laxman Bhalerao helmed a tamasha troupe which was famous in the region of Usmanabad, Beed and Latur. Wherever this troupe would go, Laxman Bhalerao used to take Arjun with him. Having been exposed to the life of tamasha artists, and subsequently to music, Arjun developed a keen sense of the music that was being produce by Dalits, as well as their lives and struggle. Such was the impact of the powerful narratives of anti-caste jalsas, like the Satyashodhak Jalsa, that he would not pay heed to the dangerous conditions around him. In 1924, an epidemic of plague had taken its toll on the region he was living in. Even in such a situation, he made sure to be present at the Satyashodhak Jalsa of Ramchandra Ghadge, which possessed undisputed fame during this era. He once mentioned, тАЬFour to five people used to die every day. The image of the light from the flames of the burning bodies, which could be seen from both sides of the river, was depressing. But I was so moved by this jalsa that I would use the light created by the flames of these burning bodies to find my way to it.тАЭ But it was only in 1927 that he realised the jalsa's potential to bring about change in the society. In the same year, he was selected for a teacherтАЩs training program in Pune, and the following year, he was appointed as a teacher in the village of Kasabe Tadawale. This was at the peak of AmbedkarтАЩs movement. In the Tadwale village, a newspaper called AmbedkarтАЩs Janata was being read dedicatedly, because it spoke about the suffering and issues of Dalits тАФ it became their voice. Arjun Hari Bhalerao too was influenced by it, and he started writing as a result. Though he began by writing songs, he realised that the jalsa is a much more effective medium to disseminate Babasaheb Ambedkar's words. Kasabe Tadwale was the village of many tamasha artists. However, many of them had to move out of the village in order to survive and take up any sort of job that came their way. Hunger was thus an impediment to achieving an anti-caste vision. Bhalerao perhaps realised this. The formation of an Ambedkarite jalsa wasnтАЩt an easy task. He had to first convince artists about the ideas he was intending to perform, and then he had to make sure that practice sessions would be regular. Despite the lack of adequate funds and costumes for performances, Bhalerao was determined to form a jalsa that would spread AmbedkarтАЩs words to the people. But the obstacles he faced weren't just material ones. In 1947, he and members of his jalsa had a close brush with death during a performance in the district of Latur. When Brahmins and Marathas in the region found out that the jalsa was going to be performed, they were ready to attack those who were directly associated with it and those supported it. In spite of these difficulties, he and his jalsa continued to perform. He explored forms within the jalsa, such as 'wagg', 'gaulan' and farce. Sample one of the earliest 'kawans' he wrote: Mahne Arjuna gulamgirichi! Hoti bedi annyachi! Shikvun soda bal! Purana gela tumcha kaal! (Arjuna talks about slavery! Of the shackles of injustice! Educate your child ! your past destroyed by Puranas!) It must be noted that the era when he performed with his jalsa was a time of radical social and cultural change among Dalits тАФ a period when talking about caste injustice and attempts to promote education were nothing short of revolutionary. Ekmekanchya warkhali! Kiti varsh vaya geli! Eki nahi tumchi jhali! Jhali re seema! (Living as inferior and superior! How many years have been destroyed! We did not unite! This is the limit now)  Despite creating an influential body of work and being one of the shahir-cum-jalsakars who took Ambedkar and his ideas to the most marginalised people across villages, his work is still not known to many today. Dyanewshwar Dhaware, an author of Ambedakari Jalsa Tadwalkarancha succinctly explains the reason behind this. тАЬFrom the period of Maharaki before the 1940s to the period after the 1960s, social life had been completely changed. Old occupations were abandoned. This community [Dalits], which used to work in the jalsa, was trying to adjust and adapt to the new means of livelihood. During these 20 long years, people who worked in the jalsa itself had begun to forget the times of the jalsa.тАЭ As Babasaheb Ambedkar once suggested, even ideas die if there is no one to spread them. Arjun Hari Bhalerao died on 17 February 1992. If one examines the conditions he grew up and lived in, the music he created and the anti-caste movement he led, it can be said without a doubt that he will always remain a hero, regardless of the extent of his reach. He used music not just to entertain, but also to educate. *** Also read parts one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine of this series.

2140,Corona Crisis and Dalit Scenario | hastakshep news,"Posted By: hastakshep news 13th April 2020 According to the 2011 Economic and Caste Census, 4.42 crore families out of total families in India belong to the Scheduled Castes (Dalits). Only 23% of these families live in good houses, 2% in habitable houses and 12% in dilapidated houses. 24% of these families live in grass pallet, polythene and mud houses. It is clear from these figures that most of the Dalits do not even have a habitable house. Many Dalits do not even own their house land. It is also well-known that most of the Dalits and Adivasis are living in these slums. It can be estimated how physical distancing is possible to prevent Corona in these small houses and huts with large families. Dharvi Slum of Maharashtra is its biggest example where Corona infection cases are turning up very fast. If this situation continues, the chances of its spread are very high. According to the above Census only 3.95% Dalit families have government jobs. Only 0.93% have state sector and only 2.47% have private sector employment. It is clear from this that Dalit families are the biggest victims of unemployment. It is worth meditating that despite 70 years of reservation being implemented, why the representation of Dalit families in government jobs is only 3.95%? Has there not been enough dishonesty in the implementation of reservation? Have not the Dalits been cheated openly in the name of merit and have not been deprived of their constitutional right (share)? Even if the false reasoning of lack of merit among the Dalits is accepted, then who is responsible for not allowing merit to grow among Dalits in so many years? It has emerged in this Census that only 83.55% of the Dalit families in the country have a monthly income of more than 5,000. Only 11.74% of households have monthly income between 5,000 and 10,000 and only 4.67% of families have income above 10,000. Only 3.56% of the families have a monthly income of more than 5,000 from a government job. It is clear from these figures that the percentage of Dalits below poverty line is very high; due to which Dalits are the worst victims of malnutrition. Similarly, according to the above Census, 56% of the households in rural areas are landless. Of these, the percentage of landless Dalits can be more than 70 to 80%. The condition of landlessness of Dalits is their biggest weakness due to which they remain completely dependent on the landholding castes. Similarly, 51% of the households in the countryside are Manual Labour, out of which the percentage of Dalits can be more than 70 to 80%. According to the Census, only 18.45% of Dalit families have nonirrigated land, 17.41% have irrigated land and 6.98% have other land. It is clear from it that the landlessness of Dalits is about 91%. Dalit labourers have maximum dependence on agricultural wages. According to the Census, only 30% of the households in the countryside get employment in agriculture, so it can be estimated how many Dalits can get employment in agriculture. This is the reason that Dalits are the most migrated labour from the village to the cities. In the recent times of Corona crisis, the majority of them are Dalits who have migrated from the cities to the village in reverse migration. The landlessness of Dalits and the compulsion of Manual Labour is their biggest weakness. For this reason, they can neither demand high rates of agricultural wages nor are they able to strongly oppose the daily atrocities and oppression. Therefore, for Dalits, land and employment is their biggest requirement, but for this Modi government has no agenda. In contrast to this, the Modi government is making the Dalits landless by acquiring land and reducing employment opportunities in this area by not investing in agriculture. In other areas too, the government has failed miserably in generating employment. Due to privatization of public sector undertakings, the employment opportunities available to Dalits through reservation are also shrinking. In contrast, Dalit and other workers are being exploited openly by the contractual labour practice. The Modi government has harmed the workers by relaxing the labour laws. Due to this, open exploitation of labourers is taking place, whose biggest victims are the Dalit families. Current corona epidemic studies in the US have found that there are more black people among infected / deceased people than whites. Four main reasons have been cited for this: more poor health and less health facilities availability and discrimination, more Black Americans being engaged in essential services, insufficient information and smaller homes. In the case of Dalits in India, apart from all these factors, the biggest factor is social discrimination. That is why it is natural that in our country, like black Americans, Dalits and Adivasis being at the bottom of the society are likely to be the most affected by Corona. . The Dalits/Adivasis are going to suffer the most in jobs which have been lost due to the present Corona crisis. According to the recent estimates, about 40 crore people in India are likely to be unemployed as a result of Corona crisis and most of them are going to be Dalits. With this, the coming recession is going to have its worst effect on Dalits and other poor sections. It has also been seen that the relief announcements made by the government during the current crisis are completely inadequate and are the same as cumin seeds in the camelтАЩs mouth. In these schemes, such conditions are imposed on the eligibility that it is becoming impossible for the common man to get their benefits. The plight of Dalits in the Post Corona period is going to worsen because of the terrible economic recession as jobs are going to decrease enormously. Since Dalits do not have any means of production like land and trade, hence the effects of recession are going to have the most impact on Dalits. For this, it is important that Employment, like the Right to Food and Education, should also be made a Fundamental Right and the system of Unemployment Allowance should be implemented. Along with this, Health Security should also be made a fundamental right so that poor people also get health security. For this, it is necessary that the Democratic Socialistic Welfare Model of Development should be adopted in place of our present Capitalistic Model of Development. It is noteworthy that Dr. Ambedkar was a strong supporter of State Socialism (Democratic Socialism) and a staunch opponent of Capitalism. While addressing the conference of Depressed Classes Railway Workers Conference, he said that тАЬDalits have two big enemies, one is Brahmanism and the other is Capitalism.тАЭ He was very much in favour of the political power in the hands the working class. The framework of socialism was very clear in Dr. AmbedkarтАЩs mind. He considered it indispensable for the social transformation and economic development of India. He had also presented its outline to the nation in his draft of the future Constitution of India which is available in the form of a book called тАЬStates and MinoritiesтАЭ. He was in favour of having all major and basic industries and insurance under state control, nationalization of agricultural land and collective farming. He was in favour of giving agriculture the status of state industry. Dr. Ambedkar did not want to make the right to property a fundamental right, but it was not under his control. The present Corona crisis has proved that the Capitalistic Model of Development in most countries including India has promoted exploitation and inequality. It has failed miserably to solve basic problems of common people. Ever since the corporatization of politics and the importance of finance capital have increased, since then democracy has turned into a monopoly of totalitarianism and rightist stance. The fact has also emerged from this Corona crisis that only socialist countries like Cuba, Vietnam and China have been able to face this crisis. Only their democratic socialistic system is capable of protecting the life of mankind. Otherwise you must have heard about US President Donald Trump wherein he says that about two and a half million Americans have to die from Corona and he cannot do anything in it. This is the tragic call of the supreme model of capitalism, showing that the capitalist system that thrives on profits is completely hollow. Therefore, protecting the interests of Dalits is also possible in the Democratic Socialist polity only. BabasahebтАЩs vision will come true only when Dalits, getting free from BSP, Athawale, Ramvilas and other people engaged in the service of capitalists, will join hands with radical agenda like land distribution, employment, health security, education and dignity based democratic socialist politics. Only this politics will establish a welfare state in which the challenges of the post-Corona period can be answered. The All India PeopleтАЩs Front is an attempt of democratic socialist mass politics.   Sharing is caring! You must log in to post a comment. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Born on April 14, 1891, into a low cast family in Madhya Pradesh, Dr BR Ambedkar grew up to become not just one of IndiaтАЩs tallest statesmen, but the champion of Dalit rights and the principal architect of IndiaтАЩs Constitution. Ambedkar Jayanti (or Bhim Jayanti) has been celebrated as a public holiday in most parts of the country since the year 2015 to commemorate his life and work and the crusade he led to guarantee the upliftment of the lower castes and тАЬuntouchablesтАЭ in India. BR Ambedkar, also lovingly called тАЬBabasahebтАЭ, was also one of the key advocates for complete independence from the British imperialist forces and his inputs laid the foundation of what came to be the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). He had received IndiaтАЩs highest civilian award тАУ the Bharat Ratna тАУ posthumously, 40 years after he passed away.

2167,Coronavirus lockdown: Milind Kamble highlights the plight of jobless Dalit workers,"Highlighting the plight of Dalit workers in the unorganised sector, Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Milind Kamble said most of them had lost their jobs in the lockdown and were struggling for food. He urged the state government to come up with a comprehensive financial package for them. While the community has been flooded with тАЬdosтАЭ and тАЬdonтАЩtsтАЭ on how to observe Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14, the government has not addressed the crucial question of how these workers are going to feed themselves and their families, Kamble said. тАЬDalits constitute majority of the workforce in the unorganised sector, both in urban and rural areas. Therefore, this is a segment that is among the worst-hit financially. With no daily earnings, they are at the receiving end,тАЭ he said. In Maharashtra, landless Dalits account for 81 per cent of farm labourers. They work on othersтАЩ farms. With agricultural activities at a standstill, these workers are struggling for their daily meal. тАЬThe entire food supply chain should have been defined under emergency category. This would have helped avoid the recurring conflicts we are seeing between the police, civic authorities and administration, which is determined to enforce the lockdown,тАЭ Kamble said. In urban areas, Dalits are mostly daily wagers in the service sector, almost 75 per cent of which is now shut. Ambedkar Jayanti on Tuesday is being used by several Dalit organisations to highlight the communityтАЩs plight. While acknowledging that staying at home was necessary, they believe the government should also address their problems. On Monday, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar urged people to commemorate Ambedkar Jayanti тАЬdigitallyтАЭ. Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal called for celebrations by reading AmbedkarтАЩs life and teachings. Social Justice Minister Dhananjay Munde appealed to people to stay safe at home. Last week, Republican Party of India chief and Union Minister for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale urged Dalits to light lamps. A senior Ambedkarite said, тАЬThere is an overdose of dos and donтАЩts from every political party and prominent leaders on how to celebrate AmbedkarтАЩs birth anniversary. It is good. But unfortunately, the same should also reflect when it comes to reaching the poor Dalits basic foodgrain.тАЭ Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar said, тАЬOur field experience is, food supply is not effective. The poor are facing hardships. And administration should wake up.тАЭ ЁЯУг The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2168,Mayawati Demands Action against BJP MP for Assault on Dalit Tehsildar in UP├втВмтДвs Kannauj,"File photo of BSP chief Mayawati. BSP chief Mayawati has demanded stern action against a BJP MP for his involvement in a case of assault against a Dalit tehsildar in Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati took to Twitter urging UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to intervene and ensure that the incident is not repeated. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Subrat Pathak, accompanied by 20 to 25 men, had allegedly broken into the house of the tehsildar, Arvind Kumar, and assaulted him over the distribution of ration to people mentioned in a list sent by him. In a series of tweets, Mayawati wrote, """"The incident from Kannauj where an honest Dalit tehsildar was beaten by a BJP MP is shameful. What is more concerning is that he is still roaming scot-free instead of going to jail."""" Demanding that Adityanath look into the matter, she wrote that non-repetition of such an act with any Dalit in the state must be ensured. """"Stern action is needed against the MP. This is what the BSP demands,"""" she wrote. A case has been registered against Pathak and 25 unidentified men, and around 10 vehicles seized from the site of the assault. Speaking to media, the tehsildar had earlier said that he had explained to the MP over the phone that other senior officials were looking into the distribution of ration to people mentioned in his list. However, despite the explanation, the lawmaker abused and threatened him. Sometime later, Pathak and his aides barged into his house and thrashed him, he had said. Pathak's supporters have denied the incident, saying that they had gone only to discuss some development projects with Kumar. A report in the matter has been filed with the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police.",0,0,1,3
2169,"Elgar Parishad: Dalit Scholar Anand Teltumbde, Activist Gautam Navlakha Surrender Before NIA","the fully loaded magazine Dalit scholar Anand Teltumbde along with activist Gautam Navlakha surrendered before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. Anand Teltumbde is the grandson-in-law of Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar, whose 129th birth anniversary is being observed on Tuesday. Teltumbde arrived at the NIA office at Cumbala Hill in south Mumbai along with his wife Rama Teltumbde and brother-in-law and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar. Navlakha surrendered in New Delhi after the Supreme Court had refused to extend his plea in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Supreme Court on March 17 this year rejected the pre-arrest bail pleas of Teltumbde and co-accused and civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha, and directed them to surrender before the investigating agency. """"Keeping with the Supreme Court's directive, Anand Teltumbde appeared before the NIA to surrender,"""" his lawyer Mihir Desai said. The academician will be placed under arrest and produced before a sessions court by evening, an official said. Civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha surrendered before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday here after the Supreme Court had refused to extend his plea in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials said. Navlakha, who has been accused under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon riots in 2018, was asked to surrender by the Supreme Court. Editor of Mumbai-based Economic and Political Weekly journal for years, Navlakha was one of the five human rights activists arrested for alleged Maoist links and involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence on January 1, 2018 but was granted protection from the arrest by the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court. A day before his arrest, Teltumbde wrote an open letter saying, """"Taking shelter under the draconian provisions of the UAPA, that renders a person defenseless, I am being jailed."""" He added that what happened to him could happen to """"anyone"""". """"As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim moment. Well, I am off to NIA custody and do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes,тАЭ he wrote. Teltumbde and other activists were initially booked by the Pune Police following violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima there. According to police, the activists made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence the next day. The police also said these activists were active members of banned Maoist groups. The case was later transferred to the NIA. Teltumbde and Navlakha were given interim protection by the Bombay High Court while their pre-arrest bail pleas were being heard. After the high court rejected their applications, the duo approached the Supreme Court. On March 17, the apex court rejected their pleas and directed them to surrender within three weeks. On April 9, the Supreme Court granted the duo another week to surrender by way of last chance.

22,"101-year-old freedom fighter protests against Citizenship Act, pictures go viral - OrissaPOST","Bengaluru: A 101-year-old freedom fighter, Harohalli Srinivasaiah Doreswamy surprised many by participating in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bengaluru, Saturday. The legendary figure sat in a hunger strike and broke his fast by drinking coconut water. Pictures and videos of Doreswamy taking part in the protests has spread like wildfire over the internet. Social media users hailed Doreswamy├втВмтДвs resilience as he battled a myriad of old age issues to stand with the protestors at the ripe old age of 101 Doreswamy was notorious during India├втВмтДвs freedom struggle for making bombs to fight the British oppressors.

121,"Athens community rallies around local street artist after tips, supplies stolen","CLARKE COUNTY, Ga. ├втВмтАЭ If you've ever visited Athens, you may have run into a disabled street artist with an incredible talent. He recently became the target of a thief trying to make some quick cash. Now, the Bulldog community is stepping in to help. Channel 2├втВмтДвs Tom Regan talked to the artist about the overwhelming kindness. ""I just look at my art as a blessing from God,├втВм┬Э Michael Davenport said. Davenport says he discovered his artistic talent in the wake of a terrible tragedy. While playing outside at age 13, he grabbed some cables that he didn├втВмтДвt know were electrified. ├втВм┼УA high voltage power line, 75,000 went through me. I was a little kid trying to be Spider-Man that day,├втВм┬Э Davenport said. He lost both of his hands, but two years later, he discovered something he never knew he could do. ├втВм┼УSo, I started writing with my mouth, and became an artist,├втВм┬Э he said. For decades now, he's been sketching bulldog portraits for University of Georgia fans. But last week, police say, someone got out of a van and stole nearly $60 that Davenport had collected from his sketches. He was on a bathroom break. ├втВм┼УI (came) back out, I noticed my red donation bowl was gone,├втВм┬Э he said. The thief also took his art supplies. But like his art, there was beauty in the response of those who├втВмтДвd heard about what happened. More and more people including Christa Perry started showing up to buy his unique sketches. ├втВм┼УHe's been around forever, and everybody loves him,├втВм┬Э Perry said. A manager at the motel where Davenport lives set up a GoFundMe fundraiser for the artist. The fundraiser page says that the manager received countless phone calls about people wanting to help pay for Davenport├втВмтДвs stay at the hotel, prompting the manager to help Davenport setup a savings account and then the GoFundMe. It says it is to ├втВм┼Уhelp him get back on his feet.├втВм┬Э It has raised more than $37,000 in donations as of Saturday morning. Caring and generous neighbors have donated thousands of dollars already. Davenport says he is grateful to all who show they care. ├втВм┼УIt made me feel good inside and let me know God (does) hear some prayers,├втВм┬Э he said. Davenport says he hopes his art provides joy and inspiration to others, especially to children. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm just trying to show everyone you can be the best you be, with hands or without hands,├втВм┬Э he said.   ├В┬й 2020 Cox Media Group ├В┬й 2021 Cox Media Group.

404,Buhler community rallies around high schooler paralyzed after crash,"A 16-year-old boy is paralyzed after a car accident Friday in Reno County, according to the family. Deputies say a small pickup truck was traveling westbound on east 4th Avenue when the driver lost control on slick roads and veered into a ditch. The pickup then rolled several times. Raiden Stewart was trapped inside. Hutchinson firefighters extracted Raiden from the pickup, and he was taken to Wesley Medical Center for treatment. His mother, Tara Stewart, says her son Raiden had surgery Saturday. She says he is paralyzed from the chest down and has limited arm movement. He fractured his spinal cord and will most likely not be able to walk again. He also has damage to his vertebral artery. Stewart says her son is a Buhler High School junior who is part of the wrestling and football team. He just took first place at the Douglas Varsity Wrestling Tournament and recently took second place at the Abilene Varsity Wrestling Tournament. Raiden's coaches say he inspired people on the football field and on the wrestling. While the prognosis is difficult, they say Raiden is already making strides in his recovery. ""His mental toughness will probably help carry him along as well. Not just his physical strength,"" said Buhler wrestling coach, Mike Zeyen. ""He has a big heart,"" said Buhler High School head football coach, Steve Warner. ""He knows he can handle it and he's going to fight."" Warner said a lot of students have traveled to see Raiden and his family. His mom is asking for thoughts and prayers in this difficult time.

416,Pakistani far-right activists sentenced over blasphemy protests,"Eighty-six sentenced for violent protests after 2018 acquittal of a Christian woman in blasphemy case. Islamabad, Pakistan ├втВмтАЬ A Pakistani court has sentenced 86 members of a far right religious party to 55-year prison terms each for taking part in violent protests against the acquittal of a Christian woman in a blasphemy case, party officials say. The verdicts were announced late on Thursday night by a court in the northern garrison city of Rawalpindi, Pir Ejaz Ashrafi, a senior leader of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA) party, told Al Jazeera. The 86 TLRYA activists were arrested in November 2018, as the party led violent protests against the acquittal by the country├втВмтДвs Supreme Court of Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman who was on death row for having allegedly committed blasphemy in 2009. Days of protests saw TLRYA activists ├втВмтАЬ led by party leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi ├втВмтАЬ block big highways and destroy public property across the country, but mostly centred in the central province of Punjab. At the time, senior TLP leader Pir Afzal Qadri had called for the judges who announced the acquittal to be killed. The charges against those sentenced include destroying public property, attacking passers-by and disrupting citizens├втВмтДв everyday life. Ashrafi said the sentences were ├втВм┼Уharsh├втВм┬Э and that his party would be appealing the decision at the high court. ├втВм┼УThis is the murder of justice. We are hopeful that they will suspend the verdict in the high court, and our legal team is working on it,├втВм┬Э he told Al Jazeera by telephone from the eastern city of Lahore, where the TLYRA is based. Bibi, a Christian woman from the central Pakistani village of Ithan Wali, was accused by two Muslim women of having committed blasphemy by insulting Islam├втВмтДвs Prophet Muhammad during an argument over a drinking water vessel in 2009. She spent eight years on death row, with rights groups arguing that there were numerous fair trial concerns in her case, as are commonly reported in most blasphemy prosecutions in Pakistan. In 2018, the Supreme Court acquitted Bibi, ruling that prosecution witnesses had lied to implicate her. In May, she flew to Canada where she was forced to seek asylum to guarantee her and her family├втВмтДвs safety after the verdict. Blasphemy against Islam is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where the crime can carry a mandatory death sentence. Increasingly, accusations have led to violent attacks by mobs or assailants, with at least 75 people killed in such attacks since 1990, according to an Al Jazeera tally. Two of those killed ├втВмтАЬ a sitting federal minister and a serving provincial governor ├втВмтАЬ were attacked for having supported Bibi during her trial. Last month, a court in the central city of Multan sentenced university lecturer Junaid Hafeez to death for blasphemy after a six-year trial. Hafeez has spent most of his incarceration in solitary confinement due to threats against his life, his lawyer says. One of his lawyers, Rashid Rehman, was murdered in 2014 for defending him. The TLYRA has publicly endorsed violence in the name of the blasphemy laws, with a regular chant at protests such as the November demonstrations for which the activists were sentenced on Thursday calling for all blasphemers to be beheaded. Rizvi, the TLYRA chief, is currently out on medical bail as he faces charges of inciting hatred and violence at the rallies. His brother, Ameer Hussain Rizvi, and nephew are among those who were sentenced on Thursday, Ashrafi said. Asad Hashim is Al Jazeera├втВмтДвs digital correspondent in Pakistan. He tweets @AsadHashim.

581,Iran says it has made arrests over plane disaster after days of protests,"Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News TEHRAN ├втВмтАЭ Iran├втВмтДвs judiciary said Tuesday that it had arrested an undisclosed number of suspects involved in the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 aboard last week. The announcement came after days of protests shook Iran, with demonstrators railing against the government├втВмтДвs initial attempts to deny involvement in the downing of the plane. Thirty people were arrested during the demonstrations, a judicial spokesperson, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said at a news conference Tuesday. Esmaili gave no further details on the number of those arrested in connection with the downing of the passenger jet and did not reveal their names or professions. He also said that the plane├втВмтДвs black box had been taken to France for the data to be read and that more information would be released. But France├втВмтДвs bureau of aviation investigation confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that no black boxes had been sent to France and nor were they expected to be. Canada's transportation safety board had said Monday that the black boxes were damaged and remained in Iran. ""We haven't seen the extent of the damage, but extracting the data will pose some technical challenges for the Iranian investigating team,"" the head of the board said. Iran initially denied allegations that a missile had struck the plane shortly after it took off last Wednesday from Tehran, the capital, only to reverse course on Saturday and admit that it had shot down the jet by mistake. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Twitter Saturday blamed ├втВм┼Уhuman error├втВм┬Э for the ├втВм┼Уhorrific crash.├втВм┬Э Over the weekend, the U-turn prompted Iranian protesters to take to the streets demanding that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei step down. Rouhani said that one person could not be held responsible for the downing of the plane and called for a special court to investigate. Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, said the way in which the government and the establishment handle the broader repercussions of the incident could be a ""watershed moment for Iran."" ""The choices it makes are likely to reverberate throughout Iranian politics and society for months, or even years, to come,"" she wrote in an analysis piece for the BBC. Britain, France and Germany said Tuesday that they were triggering a dispute mechanism that is part of the nuclear deal with Iran, citing its failure to live up to terms of the pact. The foreign ministers of the three nations said in a statement that they were ""left with no choice, given Iran's actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments."" But, they added, their countries would not join a campaign to implement maximum pressure against Iran and hoped that parties to the nuclear accord would find a way forward to resolve the impasse and preserve the agreement. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers eased international sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in May 2018 and imposed economic sanctions on the country's oil industry, as well as banking and other key sectors. Amin Hossein Khodadadi reported from Tehran, and Saphora Smith from London. Nancy Ing contributed from Paris, Oksana Parafeniuk from Kiev, and Tom Costello from Washington.

While Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, a similar sentiment has been echoing among women at Khureji Khas. The movement, which started as a small awareness campaign seeking to put an end to the misinformation, has now grown into a key anti-CAA protest site. Around 1,500 women have been participating at this peaceful gathering on all the days. One of them is 28-year-old Mehnaaz Sheikh, who recently quit her job. Mehnaaz, a resident of Khureji, was an English teacher at a private school. On being asked about her family├втВмтДвs reaction over her decision, she replies, ├втВм┼УEven though my family is financially stable, I have always wanted to be independent. This is a sacrifice I made for my country,├втВм┬Э she adds. While sharing her experience, Mehnaaz is offered tea by a girl. Braving the winter cold, she holds the paper cup between her palms to absorb its warmth. Just like Mehnaaz, 32-year-old Sadaf, who was working as a receptionist in a private firm, put down her papers. She had to convince her family to let her work in the first place, but after seeing the dadis of Shaheen Bagh, she too decided to quit. Sadaf has been participating in protests across the city ever since. ├втВм┼УI stay at these protests all night. I barely know people in my locality, but these women have now become a part of my family,├втВм┬Э she says. Thirty-year-old Nazia is another woman who decided to leave her job to participate in the protests. Like Mehnaaz and Sadaf, she too says that quitting her job was a sacrifice she made for her country. ├втВм┼УFor me, the world revolved around work and home, but for these protests, I have been staying out till 5 am. In these 30 days I have seen parts of Delhi I had never heard of.├втВм┬Э There is hardly any place to walk inside the tent. There is a makeshift stage where women wait for their turn to address the crowd. Everyone greets each other with hugs and broad smiles. For a lot of these women, convincing their families to let them work had been a difficult task.While there are many male relatives at the protest site, these women do not fear defying gender roles for a larger cause. They juggle between participating in protests and completing household duties, no matter how sleep deprived they feel. Naima, a homemaker, rocks her sleeping baby in her arms. She says she wishes to give her child a future where his loyalty towards the country will not be questioned. As she participates in the protest for 12 hours, her household duties, she says, have taken a backseat. Several attempts have been made to malign and discredit the protest at Khureji Khas with rumours doing rounds that the women were paid to protest. Shama, a middle-aged woman, dismisses these allegations. ├втВм┼УI have everything, why would I come here for money,├втВм┬Э she asks. Overhearing our conversation, a woman from the back shouts, ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвll give them Rs 2,000 if they (ministers) are willing to come here and hear our ordeal!├втВм┬Э She recounts news from her hometown in Muzzafarnagar and tears up. Khureji├втВмтДвs women have faced criticism with many saying that the protests have resulted in traffic jams and caused disruption of movement. To shield protests at Khureji, committees were formed to ensure the smooth functioning of the demonstrations. ├втВм┼УWe have legal, medical, traffic, security and stage committees,├втВм┬Э says Amaantullah, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia. As we exit the tent, chants of ├втВм╦ЬAzaadi├втВмтДв resonate in the air, reminding us of an India that is led by its women.

908,"Via Rail cancels most trains nationwide, CN closes Eastern Canadian network as Indigenous protests continue | CBC News","CN Rail and Via Rail are shutting down huge sections of their railway networks as Indigenous blockades continue to cripple the country's transportation systems. Via Rail is temporarily ending most passenger services nationwide, expanding an earlier work stoppage that restricted train cancellations to the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor. ""Via Rail has no other option but to cancel all of its services on the network, with the exception of Sudbury-White River (CP Rail) and Churchill-The Pas (Hudson Bay Railway), until further notice,"" the rail operator said in a media statement. The company said it would automatically process full refunds for all cancelled trips. ""You do not need to contact Via Rail to confirm the refund, but note that due to the volume of transactions it may take up to 15 days to receive,"" the Crown corporation said. ""We understand the impact this unfortunate situation has on our passengers and regret the significant inconvenience this is causing to their travel."" CN Rail, the country's largest railway, is ""initiating a progressive and orderly shutdown of its Eastern Canadian network"" because Tyendinaga Mohawk protesters near Belleville, Ont. have so far refused to dismantle their blockade. The railway operator said the shutdown, which will affect the entire network east of Toronto, may result in temporary layoffs of CN workers. Teamsters Canada, the union which represents over 16,000 workers in the rail industry, said Friday the shutdown could lead to roughly 6,000 layoffs. Via Rail trains run on CN tracks in most parts of the country, a vestige of a time when CN ran its own passenger trains. ""With over 400 trains cancelled during the last week and new protests that emerged at strategic locations on our mainline, we have decided that a progressive shutdown of our Eastern Canadian operations is the responsible approach to take for the safety of our employees and the protestors,"" J.J. Ruest, the president and CEO of CN, said in a media statement. ""This situation is regrettable ... these protests are unrelated to CN's activities and beyond our control. Our shutdown will be progressive and methodical to ensure that we are well set up for recovery, which will come when the illegal blockades end completely."" Last weekend, CN Rail obtained a court injunction to end the illegal Mohawk demonstration. The injunction has been ignored by the protesters. Activists also ignored a request from the on-reserve Tyendinaga Police for them to voluntarily dismantle the blockade. The injunction forbids any continued interference with the rail line under the threat of arrest. The Ontario Provincial Police has not yet enforced the injunction. The federal government, which has jurisdictional authority over railways, has so far refused to intervene. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller has agreed to meet with the Mohawks on Saturday. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he plans to meet with his provincial and territorial counterparts Friday, adding he is in contact with CN and CP. In a statement Thursday, Garneau said ""freedom of expression"" is an important democratic right, but added, ""these activities must respect the court decisions and the law."" The Mohawk activists have said they won't end their demonstration until the RCMP leaves the traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en in northern B.C. Wet'suwet'en hereditary leaders had been blocking road access to a construction site for the Coastal GasLink pipeline, a key part of a $40-billion LNG Canada liquefied natural gas export project. While much of the police action near that road ended Tuesday with multiple arrests, the RCMP still has officers stationed near the pipeline construction site. A separate rail blockade on CN tracks near New Hazelton, B.C. was set to end today after Gitxsan hereditary chiefs agreed to end protests designed to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett and her provincial counterpart will hold talks with both the Gitxsan and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs in the coming days. A prolonged shutdown could have devastating consequences for the country's economy. CN moves more than $250 billion a year in goods across its transcontinental network. The shutdown threatens the transport of food and consumer items, grain, de-icing fluid for airports, construction materials, propane supplies for Quebec and Atlantic Canada, and natural resources like lumber, aluminum and coal, the railway said. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the federal and provincial governments and the police to immediately end the transport chaos and help CN restore rail service. ""From propane to grain and food and consumer items, Canada's supply chains are being severely damaged by the continuing interruptions to Canada's rail services by protestors,"" the organization said in a statement. ""The rail system affects the entire Canadian economy and Canadians everywhere, including people trying to get to and from work. They must be allowed to continue to serve the thousands of businesses that depend on them."" Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, said this shutdown could be hugely problematic. ""It's a critical situation. It's an extremely dire situation for the economy and, in the coming days, for communities across the country,"" he told CBC's Power & Politics. He said 80 per cent of his industry's products, such as jet fuel for planes and chlorine for drinking water, are shipped by rail. Masterson said the provincial police need to enforce the court-ordered injunction and clear out the Mohawk protesters. ""Everyone has the right to protest ... but the courts have said, 'You've gone too far, it's no longer in the public interest,'"" he said. ""The actions are illegal, this is trespassing.

957,Shaheen Bagh protest site seen empty as AAP all set to return in Delhi,"It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the government├втВмтДвs move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats. The Congress party, on the other hand, seems to be on its way to acquire another duck. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1008,Community rallies to give local Vietnam veterans with no living relatives a proper funeral,"FOX 4 Kansas City WDAF-TV | News, Weather, Sports by: Sean McDowell  LEAVENWORTH, Kan. ├втВмтАЭ It├втВмтДвs a tragic sign of the times. Many U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War era are passing on, and some are passing on with no remaining relatives to bury them. On Thursday, a community banded together to give two fallen patriots a special sendoff. They were unknown to many, but people in Leavenworth wouldn├втВмтДвt let them be forsaken either. Leavenworth National Cemetery hosted around 100 people Thursday to say farewell to retired U.S. Army Prt. Arlen Zimmerman and Spc. Thomas Winstead, two soldiers who served in Vietnam. Both men died since November 2019, leaving no known blood relatives behind. Cars entering the cemetery lined up, carrying people who├втВмтДвd rallied the effort to ensure Zimmer and Winstead wouldn├втВмтДвt have an empty funeral. ├втВм┼УI thought it was just going to be me and my wife. I really did,├втВм┬Э Kansas City resident Mike Pence said. Pence, also a U.S. Army veteran, is believed to be the only person in attendance who knew either man. ├втВм┼УI just couldn├втВмтДвt have wished for something better for him. The respect and the ceremony was beautiful,├втВм┬Э Pence said. ├втВм┼УThis overwhelmed me.├втВм┬Э Staff members from the Veterans Administration accepted a ceremonial American flag, delivered by a military honor guard, on behalf of Winstead├втВмтДвs estate. Current and former military members came to share a solemn salute. ├втВм┼УThe type of war they faced in Vietnam left them fairly alone in their personal lives and their families, battling addiction or depression,├втВм┬Э U.S. Navy Lt. Houston Benson said. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs fairly uncommon for people to be buried alone, but in this particular war, it├втВмтДвs more common than it should be.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УIt broke my heart because no human being should be buried with no one. I decided they took the call of duty and went, so I thought I could do the same thing,├втВм┬Э Retired U.S. Navy officer Stephen Lopez said. As many as 100 people showed up on a cold afternoon to say goodbye to two men they├втВмтДвd never met before. Virtually every branch of the U.S. military was represented, members who agreed there├втВмтДвs something special about the people who came out to pay their respects to these fallen veterans. ├втВм┼УWhen you├втВмтДвve been in a war, and you lose so many friends, you know all the guys ├втВмтАЭ maybe not personally, but you live with them. We├втВмтДвre all the same,├втВм┬Э Lopez added. ├втВм┼УHe was an amazing guy. He deserved something incredible like this,├втВм┬Э Pence said. The VA pays for the burial of fallen soldiers as part of their death benefits. However, people in attendance Thursday praised the Muehlbach Funeral Home, which helped coordinate the memorial service.

1371,"Riot August says top lane Soraka is too strong, will receive ""pretty hard"" nerf | Dot Esports","You can choose which categories you want to be notified for. Soraka has taken over the top lane this patch. Over these past few weeks, top lane Soraka has become a strong pick in both the professional and casual League of Legends scenes. Unfortunately for anyone who wanted to try her out, however, Riot Games has already confirmed that it will be nerfing her soon. Riot├втВмтДвs senior champion designer August Browning said that the Starchild has one of the highest win rates of any top lane champion in the game.

Lots of oil extraction, lots of fossil fuel consumption, a reputation as a national environmental leader and a reality that could use some help. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm really happy that we├втВмтДвre here,├втВм┬Э said Fonda, urgent and intense. ├втВм┼УThis is the place we can really emphasize stopping the drilling and the fracking.├втВм┬Э She said she wants Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an end to new oil-drilling permits in the state. She paused. Smiled. And continued in a conspiratorial whisper: ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre meeting with him, by the way, next Thursday.├втВм┬Э The women├втВмтДвs laughter drowned her out. ├втВм┼УOil rules in California. It├втВмтДвs very hard for politicians to stand up to Big Oil. But that├втВмтДвs where leaders come from.├втВм┬Э Fonda has spent most of her adult life juggling two full-time careers: as an actor with dozens of movies, documentaries and television shows under her very small belt; and as an activist, supporting women├втВмтДвs rights, the antiwar movement, the United Farm Workers, the Black Panthers, Native American rights, reproductive rights and the environment, among other causes. Climate change, she said in an interview after the West Hollywood event, ├втВм┼Уbrings it all together. .... It may look like, in my life and my history as an activist, there have been a lot of different things, [but] they├втВмтДвre all connected.├втВм┬Э Fonda said she├втВмтДвs been supporting indigenous rights in tribal country since 1970. Today, she said, much of that same land contains ├втВм┼Уso much fossil fuel, so much of the materials that the oil companies want to extract, that they are front-line communities now in the war against fossil fuel.├втВм┬Э Annie Leonard is executive director of Greenpeace USA, which is part of the Fire Drill Friday effort. She said Fonda has ├втВм┼Уa phenomenal ability to draw new people into the movement, especially women over 50. She did [the Washington protests] for 14 weeks. ... Hundreds and hundreds of people came.├втВм┬Э Fonda said she sees herself and other celebrities as ├втВм┼Уrepeaters,├втВм┬Э the antennae on the tops of mountains that pick up communication signals and transmit them to wider audiences. ├втВм┼УI don├втВмтДвt do the science,├втВм┬Э she said. ├втВм┼УI don├втВмтДвt do the research. I├втВмтДвm not the wonk. But I can pick up the signals of the people in Wilmington or the scientists in their labs and expand their voices. That├втВмтДвs what I think the role of someone like me is.├втВм┬Э Among her biggest regrets, Fonda has said repeatedly through the years, was posing on an anti-aircraft gun during a tour of North Vietnam in 1972, which earned her the nickname Hanoi Jane. She has been proudest, she said Saturday, of Fire Drill Fridays, which are the joy of her ninth decade. ├втВм┼УTen thousand people have signed up to take it nationally,├втВм┬Э she said. ├втВм┼УI had no idea that this was going to happen. It was an instinct. I may be famous and white and privileged, but when I feel a need for something, I find there├втВмтДвs usually a whole lot of people who feel the same need. ... With Fire Drill Fridays, the rallies, the civil disobedience, the risking arrest, appealed to a whole lot of people.├втВм┬Э In her daily life, Fonda says, she does her best to be environmentally minded. She bought a Prius when they first appeared and switched to an electric car last year. Meat once a month, fish, twice. No single-use plastics. The red coat she bought for the protest was the last piece of clothing she plans to purchase, she said, with the exception, perhaps, of some underwear and socks. When you see her at the Oscars on Feb. 9, she├втВмтДвll be wearing a dress that├втВмтДвs a decade or so old, an Elie Saab number she├втВмтДвs already worn on the red carpet at Cannes. ├втВм┼УI haven├втВмтДвt changed sizes, and I have a closet full of clothes,├втВм┬Э Fonda said. ├втВм┼УI don├втВмтДвt need anything. So If I don├втВмтДвt need anything, I├втВмтДвm not going to get it.├втВм┬Э But she won├втВмтДвt be getting arrested in Los Angeles on Friday. After five arrests in Washington, she was facing possible court dates 2,000 or so miles from the set of ├втВм┼УGrace and Frankie,├втВм┬Э community service equally far away. So her lawyer negotiated a deal: She can film in California if she does not engage in civil disobedience for 90 days. Which ends in April. At which time, she said, she plans to hold out her wrists for those zip-tie handcuffs yet again. ├втВм┼УOf course,├втВм┬Э she said. Of course.

1485,Trucker Convoy Heads To Salem To Protest Cap And Trade Bill | KXL,"Salem, Ore. ├втВмтАЬ Oregon├втВмтДвs timber workers are preparing for a convoy to the Capitol. They├втВмтДвll be coming from all over the state, driving to Salem first thing in the morning to protest the new Cap and Trade bill. The bill is aimed at reducing Oregon├втВмтДвs carbon emissions, but loggers and other trade workers say the gas tax part of the bill will hit them especially hard. The group Timber Unity on Facebook has about 53,000 members. They believe Oregon can reduce carbon emissions without any new taxes. They├втВмтДвll present their own plan to do that today. KXL├втВмтДвs Rosemary Reynolds is talking with truckers at the weigh station in North Plains and will have more on the story throughout the day. Check out these photos from Rosemary:  One couple on their way to Salem this morning is Dawn and her husband. They├втВмтДвre longtime small business owners in East county and have never been politically active until now. Dawn tells KXL├втВмтДвs Jacob Dean they├втВмтДвll be volunteering, helping to setup in Salem later this morning. On the other side of the issue ├втВмтАЬ some Rural Oregonians strongly support the Cap and Trade bill. Meghan Kemple is the Director of the Oregon Climate and Agriculture Network. She says over 250 stake holders like farmers and ranchers from across Oregon have signed a letter in support of the proposal. She tells KXL├втВмтДвs Mike Turner, significant changes have been made to the policy that will protect rural communities and address concerns. Like rising fuel costs will actually phase in over time. Meanwhile, a Republican lawmaker in Salem says Democrats are making another GOP walkout likely, because of amendments they added to a cap and trade bill. Senator Fred Girod tells the Statesman Journal the bill which would raise fuel prices to cap greenhouse gases, is even worse than the original, that led to a Republican walkout last year, which denied Democrats a vote on the bill. ├В┬й 2021 Alpha Media LLC.All Rights Reserved.",1,3,0,0

1814,Trump refuses to halt rallies as coronavirus surges,"Palm Beach (United States) (AFP) - US President Donald Trump signaled Saturday that he has no intention of halting campaign rallies despite surging coronavirus infections, as a case was confirmed for the first time within miles of the White House. The president struck a defiant tone as he spoke to reporters about the outbreak at his Mar a Lago resort in southern Florida, where he was hosting his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro. ""We will have tremendous rallies and we're doing very well, and we've done a fantastic job with respect to that subject,"" Trump responded when asked if his ""Keep America Great"" campaign events would continue. Trump's remarks came as the number of cases confirmed across the United States leapt past 400, with 19 deaths confirmed so far, mainly in the west coast state of Washington. Meanwhile health authorities announced the first confirmed case in the nation's capital -- a Washington DC resident in his 50s with no history of international travel and no close contacts with anyone known to be infected. Asked if he was concerned that the virus had spread to within a few miles of the White House, Trump replied: ""No, I'm not concerned at all."" The president had already insisted as he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday that the risk of having so many people in close proximity ""doesn't bother me at all."" The CDC warns on its coronavirus web page against people congregating in crowds and encourages the elderly, in particular, to stay home as much as possible. Trump has been holding rallies -- which attract many senior citizens -- at a rate of more than one a week recently, often as counter-programming to Democratic primary contests or debates. However, his website currently indicates ""no events scheduled"" for the coming days, without giving a reason. Trump has been heavily criticized for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration's own experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus. At a freewheeling news conference at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, the president claimed falsely that tests for the virus were available for anyone who needed one. The event was intended to update the public on the epidemic. Instead, the president made headlines by calling the governor of the worst-hit state, Washington, a ""snake,"" revealing that he preferred to keep sick Americans on a stranded cruise ship to keep the infection numbers down, complained about CNN and revealed that he was surprised to discover that people could die from the flu. More than 100,000 people have been infected globally by the new coronavirus, with more than 3,500 deaths announced so far, mainly at the epicenter in China. Trump's potential Democratic challengers for the presidency in November, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden have also continued to hold campaign events attracting large crowds during the crisis.

1825,Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant Cancels On Danish Festival To Protest Whaling - Cosmic,"Led Zeppelin├втВм╦Ьs Robert Plant has canceled an upcoming G! Festival appearance in protest of an annual whaling practice known as grindadr├Г┬бp (the ├втВм┼УGrind├втВм┬Э). G! Festival, is a yearly event held at the seaside village of G├Г┬╕ta on the Danish archipelago of the Faroe Islands. Coinciding with the festival the Grind sees over a thousand pilot whales and dolphins driven to the shores of local beaches and slaughtered by island residents. While the Grind is a thousand-year-old tradition, the manner in which it is conducted is considered by animal rights activists as appallingly cruel. ├втВм┼УWhen whalers locate the whale pods,├втВм┬Э local Rannv├Г┬б Johansen has shared of the event to BluePlanetSociety.org, ├втВм┼Уthey are driven ashore, [which can take] a very long time. The whales then get stressed and the entire whale family can see each other being killed and hear screaming from their babies. They can only wait for themselves to feel the knife.├втВм┬Э Plant was set to perform at the festival on July 18th, However, G! Festival has now announced via its official website that the Led Zeppelin vocalist and new backing outfit Saving Grace will no longer appear after having the cull brought to their attention by environmental advocacy group Blue Planet Society. ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre disappointed and annoyed with the cancelation,├втВм┬Э G!

1979,Coronavirus outbreak: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden cancel Cleveland rallies,"Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden's presidential campaigns canceled rallies set for Cleveland on Tuesday night due to coronavirus concerns, the first disruptions the outbreak has caused in the 2020 Democratic primary. In separate announcements, the Democratic presidential contenders' campaigns said they exercised caution about holding large public gatherings after hearing guidance from public health officials. Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns thanked supporters who planned to attend the events on a crucial day in the race to decide who faces President Donald Trump in November. In a statement, Sanders communications director Mike Casca said the Vermont senator's campaign will evaluate future events ""on a case by case basis."" Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said the campaign will ""make announcements about future events in the coming days."" The Democratic front-runner plans to deliver remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:30 p.m. ET. Asked Tuesday about Trump's plans for future rallies, Vice President Mike Pence said the campaign would make decisions ""literally on a day to day basis."" He added that he is confident the campaign ""will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward."" The cancellations come at a pivotal time for the rivals jockeying for position in the Democratic primary. Six states, including crucial Michigan, hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday as Biden tries to amass enough delegates to pull the Democratic nomination out of Sanders' reach. Ohio, which awards a significant 136 pledged delegates, votes next week. Read more: Biden and Sanders' fight over trade is a war for the future of the Democratic Party Questions have swirled about when the outbreak would affect a closely watched and consequential Democratic primary. Mass gatherings where the virus could spread make up a core part of Sanders' strategy. Biden relies less on rallies than his rival. Washington state, one of the areas in the U.S. most affected by the outbreak, holds its primary on Tuesday. While voters cast ballots by mail and will not physically go to the polls and risk spreading coronavirus, the state told voters not to lick envelopes. At least 808 people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus, and at least 28 have died from it, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Got a confidential news tip?

1984,"Trump campaign turning MAGA rallies into slick, locally targeted TV ads","It's the latest way the campaign is working to capitalize on Trump's rallies. Bipartisan concern grows over federal response to coronavirus outbreak While President Donald Trump delivered a fiery speech at his South Carolina rally Friday night, blasting Democrats and defending his administration├втВмтДвs coronavirus response, his campaign was working to turn the event into a slick, locally focused TV ad that will soon run in the area. It├втВмтДвs part of the re-election team├втВмтДвs new strategy to flip the president├втВмтДвs sprawling campaign rallies into locally centered TV ads that air days after his road show has left town. The strategy is geared toward further extending the reach and media attention that Trump rallies already generate. The campaign has produced and run six-figure ad buys after rallies in New Hampshire, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado -- with plans to roll run another local ad highlighting Trump's North Charleston rally, a senior Trump campaign official told ABC News. The president tweeted out a version of the South Carolina ad but the campaign hasn├втВмтДвt announced its placement or a buy yet. According to ad service firm CMAG, the Trump campaign placed a $139,000 ad buy in Nevada to run over the next two weeks, and spent $188,760 in Colorado for the week of Feb. 25-Mar. 2. The ads themselves serve as a 90-second highlight reel recapping each rally, carefully curated by the campaign to air in local markets. They promote issues specific to each state like immigration in Nevada and record low unemployment in South Carolina. The Arizona ad features the viral video of a World War II veteran being carried to his seat at the Phoenix Trump rally. The new ads mostly omit the attacks the president heaves at his Democratic rivals, and instead showcase interviews conducted by the campaign with supporters, as well as local news coverage, while sticking mostly to pre-written sections of the president's stump speech -- shying away from highlighting the president├втВмтДвs off-script and polarizing moments. ├втВм┼УIt is an interesting way to keep the campaign├втВмтДвs message on track,├втВм┬Э Vanderbilt political scientist John Geer, whose research focuses on political advertising, told ABC News. ├втВм┼УIt is also an approach that works better for the president, since he often steps on his message.├втВм┬Э Geer also questioned the ads' impact, given that voters' views of Trump are largely set. ""If you consider what happened in South Carolina, Tom Steyer would certainly question the power of ads, in general, to influence the public,"" Geer said, pointing out that the billionaire massively outspent Joe Biden in the state, only to see the former vice president get four times the vote he did. However, the Trump campaign has said they've yet to fully dive into their planned persuasion ad plan. ""We haven't even really started -- we haven't run $1 of persuasion advertising, really. We've done some but like nothing like what we're going to do over the next six months,"" a senior Trump campaign official said. And while locally focused ads aren't a new strategy for a presidential campaign, the new ads are the latest way the Trump campaign has found to extend the impact and maximize the return on investment of the president's rallies. ├втВм┼УWe just continue to try to get every ounce of value out of the rallies,├втВм┬Э Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News. ├втВм┼УWe know there are many thousands of people who were unable to get inside the rally and we want to make sure they could share in the excitement a little bit.├втВм┬Э The campaign views the president's rallies as more than just one-day events. Top surrogates like Vice President Mike Pence or Donald Trump Jr. hold local events in the days leading up to the rally, campaign staff travel the day before and flood the local media markets -- and now, in the days following the event, the campaign runs a local TV ad that was shot entirely at the rally in that market. And with each rally, the campaign also collects troves of data through everything from online ticket requests to selling merchandise inside the arena -- which can sometimes inform the team where to head next. After holding a rally in El Paso, Texas, in early 2019, the campaign said they noticed a large number of supporters coming over from New Mexico for the event -- and a few weeks later the president was in Rio Rancho. While Trump's re-election campaign has traded the retail politics of diner stops for rock concert-style rallies, the president is set to take part in his first town hall of the election cycle next week on FOX News.

2029,Shaheen Bagh protest site cleared by police as Delhi goes under coronavirus lockdown,"Jump to navigation Speak Now The Shaheen Bagh protest site, where hundreds of women were stationed for several months for the agitation against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), has been cleared by Delhi Police personnel. Delhi Police forcefully evicted the protesters from Shaheen Bagh after they showed some resistance. Only a few women protesters were still at the Shaheen Bagh site while the others had left and kept only their slippers to show solidarity. FOLLOW CORONAVIRUS LIVE UPDATES Police have detained 6 women and 3 men from Shaheen Bagh for violating Section 144 prohibitory orders. DCP South East said, ""People at the protest site in Shaheen Bagh were requested today to clear the site as lockdown has been imposed. But after they refused, action was taken against violators as the assembly was unlawful. Protest site has been cleared. Some protesters have been detained.""  #WATCH Delhi Police clears the protest site in Shaheen Bagh area, amid complete lockdown in the national capital, in wake of #Coronavirus pic.twitter.com/N6MGLTLs5Z  Before the evacuation Delhi Police heightened security at Shaheen Bagh and imposed Section 144 under CrPC. Security has also been heightened in Jaffrabad where the violent riots broke out in January.

Some people have been detained in these areas. Paramilitary forces have been deployed in all these areas after Delhi Police started enforcing the lockdown around 7-8 am on Tuesday. As the coronavirus outbreak spread and Delhi went on lockdown, most of the protesting women at Shaheen Bagh had left the protest site. Only a few remained continuing with their demand asking the Centre to repeal the controversial citizenship law. The Delhi government put the national capital on lockdown since 6 am on Monday and all public transport and non-essential services have been suspended till March 31.

2126,Watch: Makro issues lacklustre response as panic-buyers run riot,"Photo: Twitter While we were working, this lot piled up the goods for themselves and went panic-buying in Makro. Not big, not clever, and not what will beat the coronavirus. Photo: Twitter Bad, bad behaviour is this. Hundreds of shoppers have been filmed filling up their trolleys at Makro and emptying shelves at will in a bid to stockpile goods during the coronavirus pandemic. Other department stores have also been hit by the chaos, but the aforementioned retailer became the venue of choice for our hoarders. Honestly, there├втВмтДвs not much we can say in support of the stockpilers. Especially those who ran to the store during business hours on a Monday. Vital supplies, such as toilet paper, cleaning items and hygeine-related products, have all been mercilessly gobbled up. The aisles have been left bare in several stores. Granted, it├втВмтДвs not exclusively a South African problem. But it├втВмтДвs still enough to tip ordinary South Africans into apoplexy. There will be people who can├втВмтДвt get access to necessary supplies because of Monday├втВмтДвs madness. Makro did issue a statement on their coronavirus procedures, but they made no reference to the stockpilers. ├втВм┼УMakro has various measures in place to maintain a clean and healthy environment in our stores, and we have ramped these up even further. we are dedicated to keeping our stores stocked and prices fair. ├втВм┼УWe are working especially hard to replenish hand sanitisers, cleaning supplies, paper products, and other in-demand items as quickly as possible and at our everyday low prices.

2144,Large crowd blocks downtown street in protest against mining industry convention | CBC News,"About 200 people took over a downtown street on Sunday afternoon to protest against an annual mining industry convention in Toronto. As police officers watched, the protesters rallied on Front Street outside the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, where delegates had gathered for the opening day of the convention of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada. The protesters held banners, chanted ""Shame!"" and listened to speakers condemn Canadian mining industry companies for allegedly violating human rights and environmental laws in countries outside Canada in which they operate. ""I think, every day, the ecological crisis gets worse,"" Kirsten Francescone, a member of MiningWatch Canada, told reporters as the rally got underway. ""We definitely cannot think that more destructive mines that violate human rights and destroy people's environments is our way out of that ecological crisis. I am really concerned that the mining industry is using this space to say that we need mining to save us from climate change. We're here to say that shouldn't be the case,"" she added. ""We want other kinds of ways forward for a better future for all of us."" Rachel Small, a member of the Mining Injustice Solidarity Network, said it is important to stand up to what she believes is violence perpetuated by the mining industry. ""We are here in front of the world's biggest mining convention,"" Small said. ""Toronto is here to say no to business as usual with this industry continuing. We know what the Canadian mining industry looks like. We know that their business as usual is literally leading us to an unlivable planet. We cannot allow this to continue,"" she said. ""We are here in solidarity with every community around the world that has faced down the barrel of a gun for daring to say no to a Canadian extractive project."" Small said the protesters came to the rally to disrupt the convention. At one point, the protesters attempted to enter the convention but were stopped by police. They did, however, block different entrances to the building for about an hour. She said the protest was held in part to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline that would cut through their traditional territory in northern B.C. ""Canada is a country founded on the removal of Indigenous people for extractive projects. That's exactly what's happening right now on Wet'suwet'en land and that's exactly what Canadian mining projects are doing all over the world,"" she added. On Sunday, one chief and senior government ministers said they have reached a proposed agreement over land title but debate continues over the pipeline. The dispute has led to solidarity protests and rail blockades across the country. More than 50 organizations endorsed the rally. Organizers said many of the companies that provide economic support for the Costal GasLink pipeline project in B.C. also take part in the mining convention. Sponsors of the four-day conference include such mining companies as Vale, Hudbay, Barrick Gold, Teck and BHP. The association has 7,500 members. In recent years, the convention has attracted more than 25,000 people from 131 countries.   With files from Natalie Nanowski, The Canadian Press Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

2171,"""Shameless"": Court Shreds UP Over Posters Of Anti-CAA Protest Accused","The Allahabad High Court ordered the hoardings to be removed. The Yogi Adityanath government's ""name and shame"" campaign came to an abrupt halt today as the Allahabad High Court ordered that all posters and hoardings naming those accused of violence during protests against the controversial citizenship law be immediately removed. Citing the Right to Privacy as a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations as well as the Supreme Court, the judges said the government's move to display photographs and personal details of the accused on roadside hoardings was ""an unwarranted interference in privacy"". The Lucknow administration has to give a compliance report on the removal to the registrar general by March 16, the court said. Sources said the hoardings ├втВмтАЬ in which the persons named were asked to pay for damage to public property and warned that their property would be attached otherwise -- were put up on instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The High Court had taken up issue on its own, asking the government to explain its position during a rare hearing on a Sunday, a court holiday. Senior advocate KK Rai, who attended the initial hearing at 10 am, said Chief Justice Govind Mathur had made some strong remarks on the issue, saying the government was ""impinging on privacy, respect and freedom"" and called it an ""illegal move"". Today, responding to the government's contention that the court ""erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction"", the judges said, ""Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it"". The judges said they were not concerned with ""validity of the compensation fastened, but to the act about disclosure of personal details of the accused persons"". ""In the present case, the cause is not about personal injury caused to the persons whose personal details are given in the banner but the injury caused to the precious constitutional value and its shameless depiction by the administration. The cause as such is undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values,"" the judgment read.  Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who was one of the people named in the hoardings, welcomed the judgment. Calling the government's move an effort to compromise the rule of law, she said the move of the court sets an example and ""reinforces our faith in the country's constitution"". ""The damage is already done. This is a digital age. But this is a moral victory for us,"" said Deepak Kabir, theater artist and another accused in the matter.

2214,Billie Eilish sheds baggy clothes to protest body shaming at tour kickoff,"Eilish's next show is in Orlando, FL on March 10. Billie Eilish kicked off the first leg of her WHERE DO WE GO? World Tour on March 9 in Miami, FL. In addition to rocking the house with a lengthy 22-song set, the 18-year old singer also made a powerful statement regarding body positivity. Billie Eilish dominated 2019. In addition to dropping her debut length record WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? she also became the first woman to ever sweep the four main categories at the Grammys. Eilish has always been outspoken about body positivity and anti-body shaming. Since breaking through, Eilish has rocked her trademark baggy clothes-style. Speaking in a Calvin Kleins ad last May, Eilish explained her reasoning for the fashion choice. ├втВм┼УI never want the world to know everything about me. I mean, that├втВмтДвs why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion because they haven├втВмтДвt seen what├втВмтДвs underneath. Nobody can be like, ├втВм╦Ьshe├втВмтДвs slim-thick,├втВмтДв ├втВм╦Ьshe├втВмтДвs not slim-thick,├втВмтДв ├втВм╦Ьshe├втВмтДвs got a flat ass,├втВмтДв ├втВм╦Ьshe├втВмтДвs got a fat ass.├втВмтДв No one can say any of that because they don├втВмтДвt know.├втВм┬Э Now, Eilish is continuing her sentiments in a powerful, new video interlude she debuted at the start of this tour. The video occurred just before Eilish kicked into ├втВм┼Уall the good girls go to hell.├втВм┬Э In it, we see Eilish dressing down until she├втВмтДвs in her bra while a voice-over delivers a ├втВм╦Ьmust-hear├втВмтДв message. ├втВм┼УDo you really know me? You have opinions about my opinions, about my music, about my clothes, about my body,├втВм┬Э Eilish begins. ├втВм┼УSome people hate what I wear, some people praise it. Some people use it to shame others, some people use it to shame me. But I feel you watching├втВм┬ж always. And nothing I do goes unseen. So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sighs of relief, if I lived by them, I├втВмтДвd never be able to move.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УWould you like me to be smaller? Weaker? Softer? Taller? Would you like me to be quiet? Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest? Am I my stomach? My hips? The body I was born with, is it not what you wanted? If what I wear is comfortable, I am not a woman. If I shed the layers, I am a slut.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УThough you├втВмтДвve never seen my body, you still judge it and judge me for it. Why? You make assumptions about people based on their size. We decide who they are. We decide what they├втВмтДвre worth. If I wear more, if I wear less, who decides what that makes me? What that means? Is my value based only on your perception? Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?├втВм┬Э Watch the fan-shot video below. ├п┬╗┬┐ As stated, Eilish performed a staggering 22-song set that included her recent James Bond theme ├втВм┼УNo Time To Die,├втВм┬Э in addition to the hits from her body of work. Check out the full setlist below, as well as other fan-shot videos of the concert. ├втВм┼Уbury a friend├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уyou should see me in a crown├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уmy strange addiction├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уocean eyes├втВм┬Э├втВм┼УCOPYCAT├втВм┬Э├втВм┼УWHEN I WAS OLDER├втВм┬Э├втВм┼У8├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уwish you were gay├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уxanny├втВм┬Э├втВм┼УThe Hill├втВм┬Э (Mark├Г┬йta Irglov├Г┬б cover)├втВм┼Уlovely├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уlisten before i go├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уi love you├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уilomilo├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уbellyache├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уidontwannabeyouanymore├втВм┬Э├втВм┼УNo Time to Die├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уwhen the party├втВмтДвs over├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уall the good girls go to hell├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уeverything i wanted├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уbad guy├втВм┬Э├втВм┼Уgoodbye├втВм┬Э ├п┬╗┬┐ ├п┬╗┬┐ Eilish has a long way to go before the Where Do We Go Tour?

2282,"USWNT protest, invisible crest T-shirts become a record hit","Last week, an indelible protest by the U.S. women├втВмтДвs national team against the U.S. Soccer Federation turned into a viral business opportunity├втВмтАЭand showed exactly how rabid the fan base for the USWNT really is. BreakingT is a company that makes moment-driven sports apparel, the kind that can jump on fan interest in real time to sell T-shirts and sweatshirts immediately after games. The company got the license for the USWNT Players Association ahead of World Cup 2019, and it had success selling shirts during the tournament like Rapinoe-Bird 2020, a nod to Megan Rapinoe and her partner, WNBA star Sue Bird. (BreakingT also has the license for the WNBA players union.) But what happened last week during the SheBelieves Cup put those World Cup sales figures to shame. It started with Christen Press├втВмтДвs bending golazo against England. BreakingT immediately put out a shirt bearing the likeness of Press and the call from ESPN broadcast Sebastian Salazar: ├втВм┼УCHRISTEN PRESS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УThat sold really, really well,├втВм┬Э said BreakingT├втВмтДвs director of marketing, Dom Bonvissuto. ├втВм┼УAnd it just continued to shine a light on the fact that women├втВмтДвs soccer and its fans are super-passionate and exactly the right fan base to hit with this model. Then on Wednesday night we saw that the women walked out with their warmups inside out. And we were obviously struck immediately by the empty shield with the four stars. That├втВмтДвs a shirty thing. We need to get going.├втВм┬Э The USWNT├втВмтДвs protest was elegant in its simplicity. Two days earlier, new filings in the USWNT players├втВмтДв gender-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer had been released in which the federation argued that women├втВмтДвs players inherently had less skill, ability and responsibility than men├втВмтДвs players, which is why women were paid less than men. The legal strategy might have been useful in a court of law, but it was offensive and objectionable on a massive scale. Several U.S. Soccer sponsors├втВмтАЭCoca-Cola, Budweiser, Deloitte, Volkswagen├втВмтАЭissued strongly worded statements excoriating the federation. Meanwhile, the USWNT spoke with action. On game day, the players came up with a plan. Wearing their pregame warmups inside out made invisible the U.S. Soccer badge and left only the badge├втВмтДвs outline and the four stars above it, representing the team├втВмтДвs four World Cup victories. It was the perfect symbolism, a way to show the abject emptiness of the U.S. Soccer Federation while still honoring the players who have led the U.S. to its greatest soccer triumphs. The U.S. players only reinforced that point by having every single player on the team pose unsmiling in those shirts for the pregame photo that usually just includes the starting 11 players. BreakingT had a design for a T-shirt ready before the game even started and got it approved by Becca Roux, the executive director of the USWNTPA. Bonvissuto (full disclosure: He used to work as an SI.com editor) hit send on the first tweet announcing the sale of the ├втВм┼У4 Stars Only├втВм┬Э T-shirt (price: $28) at 10:17 p.m. ET on Wednesday, within minutes of the final whistle. ├втВм┼УAnd it hit like crazy,├втВм┬Э he said. Goosed along by tweets from Alex Morgan, Ashlyn Harris and Allie Long, the sales were remarkable. Even though the shirts were available for only one hour and 43 minutes on Wednesday, that day was the best-selling day for direct-to-consumer sales in BreakingT├втВмтДвs history. On Thursday came another record. ├втВм┼У4 Stars Only├втВм┬Э sold far more online than anything the company has ever produced, including all of the World Cup 2019 shirts and shirts commemorating the titles of the Washington Nationals and Kansas City Chiefs. When it came to ├втВм┼У4 Stars Only,├втВм┬Э Bonvissuto said, ├втВм┼УWe sold more than 5,000 units in the first 24 hours.├втВм┬Э The USWNT players receive a portion of the proceeds, of course, but even on Wednesday night they anticipated what they might want to do with those. ├втВм┼УWe've already had conversations about where some of the proceeds from this could go, especially with the women's national team games being canceled in April,├втВм┬Э Roux said. ├втВм┼УIs there a way for us to funnel money to those independent-contractor employees who would have otherwise received work for those two games? That was something the players brought up on Wednesday night before we knew how successful it would be after the game.├втВм┬Э One of the challenges of having a T-shirt company that has to work fast off breaking news is getting the various clearances to do so, including from the legal side of things. BreakingT did another shirt on Julie Ertz├втВмтДвs late game-winning goal against Spain (ERTZ SO GOOD). When it was pointed out on Twitter that the drawing of Ertz looked just like a shot taken by photographer Ashley Intile, the company ended up doing a royalty agreement with Intile. The success of the USWNT players├втВмтДв own licensing ventures also shows that their ability to generate revenue goes far beyond what the federation has said and done with the team in the past. As Roux put it, ├втВм┼УThe players thought there was more in the market that wasn├втВмтДвt being monetized. There was value being left on the table, while at the same time the federation was using an argument of revenue generation against them.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼У4 Stars Only├втВм┬Э is just the latest evidence. It won├втВмтДвt be the last. Novak Djokovic plans to make his return for the U.S. Open on Aug. 30 in New York, where he will look to win his 21st career major and a calendar Grand Slam. After an investigation, the Rockies said there was no racial slur directed toward Lewis Brinson. But after watching the video several times, the Marlins outfielder disagrees. Plus, why the Saints trading Michael Thomas would be unsurprising, a Jared Goff anecdote from the Lions' first practice in front of fans and more. Senior expert Michael Fabiano is full steam ahead in providing his redraft fantasy football rankings for the 2021 NFL season. Josh Sargent is headed to the Premier League after securing a transfer away from his first pro club. The Braves' Brian Snitker waited 40 years to get his shot.

2340,Councilwoman faces backlash after tweeting 'solidarity' for spreading coronavirus at Trump rallies,"Candi CdeBaca, Denver City Councilwoman, shared a meme suggesting those infected with coronavirus should attend ""MAGA"" rallies. (Photo via www.denvergov.org) Democratic Denver City Councilwoman Candi CdeBaca faced conservative criticism Tuesday after sharing a meme on Twitter suggesting she stands in ├втВм┼Уsolidarity├втВм┬Э with the idea of spreading coronavirus at President Trump├втВмтДвs campaign rallies. ""These people are sick,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted. CdeBaca, apparently posting in jest, had retweeted a meme that said: ├втВм┼УFor the record, if I do get the coronavirus I├втВмтДвm attending every MAGA rally I can.├втВм┬Э CdeBaca commented: ├втВм┼У#solidarity Yaaaas!!├втВм┬Э with laughing emojis. CdeBaca, based on her Twitter posts, appears to be a supporter of self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., one of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans quickly hit back, coming amid a partisan war of words over allegations that lawmakers are politicizing the response to the coronavirus. ├втВм┼УThis elected Democrat in Colorado doesn├втВмтДвt seem very nice!├втВм┬Э the Trump campaign War Room Twitter account posted in response. ├втВм┼УThe depths to which Democrats are sinking to politicize coronavirus is disgusting,"" Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest said in a statement to Fox News on Tuesday. ""Democrat leaders, both nationally and in Colorado, need to condemn this deranged comment.├втВм┬Э Later, CdeBaca's office called it a ""sarcastic tweet,"" in a statement to a Denver ABC affiliate. The back and forth comes as the federal government grapples with the outbreak. Trump, over the weekend, authorized new travel restrictions and warnings in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The administration├втВмтДвs strict travel warning affects Iran, Italy and South Korea at this point. The virus has sickened 89,000 people across 66 countries, resulting in at least 3,061 deaths, including six in the U.S. Most of the deaths have occurred in mainland China. Trump, on Monday, was asked whether it was ├втВм┼Уsafe├втВм┬Э for him to continue to hold his campaign-style rallies as the country battles the virus. ├втВм┼УYou should ask the Democrats,├втВм┬Э Trump said. ├втВм┼УThey├втВмтДвre all having rallies. They├втВмтДвre campaigning.├втВм┬Э He added: ├втВм┼УI think it├втВмтДвs very safe.├втВм┬Э Advertisement READ MORE @ FOXNEWS.COM This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ├В┬й2021 FOX Television Stations",0,0,0,0
2362,Joy Behar Says Trump Is 'Using Us;' Says He's Only Holding Press Briefings Because He Can't Hold Rallies ├втА╣тАа Flag And Cross,"Published on By   Joy Behar, co-host of The View, recently claimed that the only reason President Trump is doing so many press briefings is because with all of the coronavirus craziness he is unable to hold political rallies. This, of course, is just further hate spewing forth from Behar who has made it more than clear over the last several years that she is not a big fan of President Trump and his administration. Here├втВмтДвs more from The Washington Examiner: Trending: Six City Council Members Hit with Recall Notice as Fed-Up Residents Take Matters Into Their Own Hands ├втВм┼УHe cannot have his ├втВм╦ЬMAGA├втВмтДв Trump rallies anymore, where they tell him how wonderful he is,├втВм┬Э Behar said during Monday├втВмтДвs show. ├втВм┼УHe is using us instead of the MAGA rallies, and that├втВмтДвs why he makes these. He never made these when he was doing his rallies, and poor Dr. Fauci.├втВм┬Э Behar, who is quarantining out of caution during the outbreak because her age puts her in a ├втВм┼Уhigher-risk group├втВм┬Э of contracting the virus, made the statements on The View from a remote location after co-host Sunny Hostin addressed Trump├втВмтДвs daily updates to the press. ├втВм┼УIt seems to me that networks should not even be at this point broadcasting his 90 minutes of misinformation,├втВм┬Э Hostin said. ├втВм┼УI understand why Cuomo├втВмтДвs on. That├втВмтДвs one thing, but I almost think it├втВмтДвs a disservice to the country at this point.├втВм┬Э Behar later became rather gushy over Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying she├втВмтДвs ├втВм┼Уfalling in love├втВм┬Э with him. Apparently, according to her, he used to annoy her, but now she├втВмтДвs calling him ├втВм┼Уbrilliant.├втВм┬Э It seems that Behar is just looking for any excuse possible to trash on the president. A person has every right to disagree with someone and state those disagreements, but the kind of anger and hostility that Behar has for Trump is ridiculously out of proportion.

Published on By  NBC suffered its worst ratings disaster ever with the collapse of the woke 2021 Tokyo Olympics. This year├втВмтДвs numbers came in worse than the 2016 ratings for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. According to the numbers, the games were an absolute disaster for NBC. It is so bad that the network has had to start giving extra ads to advertisers because the number of viewers have been far lower than the number that advertisers paid for. Per the Daily Wire: ├втВм┼УWhen you look at the numbers, it├втВмтДвs hard to be pleased with them,├втВм┬Э University of Alabama sports communications program director Andy Billings told the AP. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs probably NBC├втВмтДвs worst-case scenario, but it├втВмтДвs probably a worst-case scenario that they would have been able to predict months ago.├втВм┬Э Fox News reported some of the Olympics├втВмтДв disappointing numbers: ├втВм┼УNBC├втВмтДвs primetime coverage of the Tokyo Olympics on July 26 averaged 14.7 million viewers ├втВмтАЭ for a 49% drop compared to the equivalent night from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and 53% less than the 2012 London Olympics. The opening ceremonies saw their lowest viewership since 1988.├втВм┬Э Americans├втВмтДв excitement for the Olympics has flagged along with other sports, and some experts are blaming an increase on athlete activism for the lack of interest in sporting events. ├втВм┼УAmericans approached the Games with a collective shrug. Thirty-six percent of those polled in late July by Monmouth University in New Jersey said they had less interest in the Olympics than usual, and 3% had more interest,├втВм┬Э the AP reported. Americans did not care at all about the woke Olympics were every other athlete supposedly competing in America├втВмтДвs name turned out to hate America!

Follow Warner├втВм┬ж Two coaches at the U. of Oklahoma now say they have the right to take punitive action against students whose politics the coaches don├втВмтДвt like. Published on By  Two women├втВмтДвs volleyball coaches at the University of Oklahoma now say they have the right to take punitive action against students whose politics the coaches don├втВмтДвt like. Can you imagine? Now these hardcore leftist, anti-American ├втВм┼Уeducators├втВм┬Э are claiming that they can destroy a student simply because the kids practice wrong think outside the classroom. This is outrageous. The coaches├втВмтДв claims come in connection to a lawsuit filed by player Kylee McLaughlin who sued coaches Lindsey and Kyle Walton along with the OU Board of Regents alleging that she had been excluded from the team ├втВм┼Уover her politically conservative views.├втВм┬Э According to The College Fix, McLaughlin made political comments that the coaches didn├втВмтДвt like and at one point, one of the coaches said that Kyle Walton told her that he wouldn├втВмтДвt coach her any more. McLaughlin said in her lawsuit that the coaches ├втВм┼Уbranded her as a racist and a homophobe├втВм┬Э and her life became difficult at the school. The College Fix adds: According to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, in their motion to dismiss the Waltons argue that even though they were the ones who injected politics into the team, they have the right to discipline those with differing views ├втВмтАЭ in the name of ├втВм┼Уteam unity.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УWhile Plaintiff was free to make bigoted statements, she was not free from the consequences of how her teammates perceived those statements,├втВм┬Э the Waltons├втВмтДв motion states. ├втВм┼УThe First Amendment cannot force her teammates to trust Plaintiff or desire to play with her. Consequently, the Complaint makes clear that Coach Walton was within her rights to cultivate a winning ├втВм╦Ьteam atmosphere by ensuring the players that ├втВм╦Ьtrust├втВмтДв each other would be on the court.├втВм┬Э In a nutshell: At a public university they can force players into volleyball-irrelevant political discussions ├втВм┬ж and to preserve├втВм┬ж Welcome to the first stages of the informational oligarchy, folks.

2374,Choa Chu Kang riot: Teenager charged with possessing two knives and sickle,"Singapore Singapore Screengrabs of videos circulating on social media showing the riot. SINGAPORE: A teenager suspected to be linked to a riot in Choa Chu Kang last week was charged on Wednesday (Mar 4) with possessing dangerous weapons. Mohammad Helmi Parmadi, 17, is accused of possessing a watermelon knife, a bread knife and a sickle along the common corridor in front of Block 703 West Coast Road on Mar 2. Helmi was remanded for investigations and will return to court on Friday. If convicted, he faces a maximum jail term of three years and at least six strokes of the cane. He is suspected to be linked to a 13-man riot that took place at Block 102 Teck Whye Lane in broad daylight on Feb 27. Weapons including a knife, knuckle dusters, a metal bar and a metal rod that were believed to have been used in the fight were seized by the police. 13 MEN CHARGED The police said last week that they were alerted to a case of rioting at 10 Choa Chu Kang Way at about 1.30pm on Feb 27. The 13 men, aged between 17 and 28, were arrested in various locations including Jalan Bukit Merah, Yishun and Bukit Batok. They were charged on Feb 29 either with rioting with a deadly weapon or unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon. According to charge sheets, the riot was between two groups, with a group of eight men wanting to hurt the second group of five men and vice versa. Those in the first group are: Zahiruddin Ariffin Zilsham, 17; Mohammad Danial Bin Mohammed Fairuz, 17; Nurhendry Alffi Farasyi Bin Maizuhar, 17; 18-year-old Ryan Sim Ming Hui; Muhammad Luqmanul Hakim Bin Muhiddin, 29; Ahmad Sirhan Bin Ahmad Zaidi, 17; Daryl Lee Zhi Heng, 18; and Syafiq Bin Safari, 18. Danial was allegedly armed with a knife, while Nurhendry purportedly had a knuckle-duster. The men in the other group listed in charge sheets are: Farhan Bin Alias, 18; 20-year-old Muhammad Irman Shah Putera Roslan; Asyraniel Hiralnyshah Jarkalishah, 17; Mohamed Danish Amsyar Ali Amran, 19; and Mohamad Haikel Rahmat, 18. Several of them were allegedly armed with parangs. FIVE MEN TAKEN BACK TO SCENE OF THE CRIME Five men were taken back to the scene of the alleged crimes on Wednesday morning for police investigations. Charge sheets state that others yet unknown might be involved in the riot as well. If convicted of rioting with a deadly weapon, they could be jailed for up to 10 years and caned. The penalty for unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon is up to five years' jail, a fine, caning, or any combination of these.

2399,Kentucky Basketball rallies past Florida Gators: 5 takeaways and postgame banter,"Filed under: The Cats fought until the end and completed an unbelievable 18-point comeback for the big-time win. The Kentucky Wildcats got a huge win against the Florida Gators 71-70 in Gainesville Saturday afternoon in the last game of the regular season. The Cats came out how many expected they might: flat. And it was clear early on as they went into the half down 40-30. After the break, it got ugly. The officiating was horrific. Cal got ejected, or so he thought, then returned to the bench. And the team seemingly fell apart. Related They fought back the last 10 minutes, but it looked all for naught. But then something happened. The Cats exploded for a huge 18-point comeback win. The energy and effort they put forward could not be questioned as the game winded down. They fought to the very end. And it all paid off. What a win!!! Wait, what happened? We blacked out Apparently though, we came back to win from an 18-point second-half deficit on the road at Florida pic.twitter.com/suqJvuQcU5 As the regular season comes to an end, the postseason is in sight. Kentucky will play at 1 p.m. ET on Friday in Nashville. March Madness is officially here. Hagans did not make the trip After the turmoil that ensued during Kentucky├втВмтДвs second half collapse against the Tennessee Volunteers, there was rampant speculation and concern surrounding the team and Ashton Hagans. Well, that finally came to light this afternoon as John Calipari announced that Hagans did not even make the trip to Gainesville. Ashton did not make the trip with us to Florida. He and I met a couple days ago and he asked to step away for a couple days for personal reasons. I support his decision. We are going to need him at 100% for the postseason. While this isn├втВмтДвt ideal heading into postseason play, the Cats need Hagans to make a deep run in the coming weeks. It looks like he├втВмтДвs still being positive, though. Let├втВмтДвs Get this Win Fellas!!! Love y├втВмтДвall boyss Be back & Better!!! https://t.co/kRwLyDDzh0 Hopefully, this is just a blip on the radar and doesn├втВмтДвt affect UK in the long term. These kinds of things tend to either tear a team apart, or bring them all together. They didn├втВмтДвt respond well today, but we├втВмтДвll see how they respond going forward. New starting five The last time I did this was because of Hagans and that├втВмтДвs the case again today. In the first matchup with the Gators, Hagans was coming off a thigh contusion and was questionable leading up to the game. He played├втВмтАЭquite a bit actually├втВмтАЭbut Johnny Juzang earned his second start in his place. This time around, Keion Brooks was the one that earned the start. And Tyrese Maxey was running the point full-time for the first time in his short college career. The rest of the lineup remained the same, with the exception of Nate Sestina who started last game for the Senior Day festivities. The absence of Hagans meant UK was only able to play seven guys, but Calipari did mention that Dontaie Allen was available off the bench. Probably best not to burn his redshirt, though. The offense was stagnant, but recovered The offense was obviously stagnant without Hagans manning it. He makes mistakes and he├втВмтДвs frustrating, but his ability to penetrate the defense and attack was clearly missing today. UK just couldn├втВмтДвt get anything going. Florida changed up the defense time and time again and the Cats simply looked confused. They settled for jumpers and missed multiple point-blank shots. However, as the game went on, they fought back and it got much better. Enough to get a huge win on the road. Same with the defense Hagans├втВмтДв absence was not only felt on the offensive end, but it was felt even more so on the defensive end. He is amazing at shutting players down, stealing passes, and disrupting the opposing team├втВмтДвs offense. That wasn├втВмтДвt there today and Kentucky looked bad at times. Whether it was losing their man or giving up easy drives, they just couldn├втВмтДвt stop the Gators. One thing that might├втВмтДвve had something to do with this was the fact that UK basically had seven guys to play the entire game├втВмтАЭassuming Cal didn├втВмтДвt want to burn Allen├втВмтДвs redshirt. That meant guys had to be careful not to foul and over-aggressiveness was probably discouraged. But in the final half of the game, the Cats continued to claw and scrape until they cleaned it up to shut down the Gators in the final 10 minutes, Sestina, Juzang, and Brooks gave some big-time minutes One positive was the play from the normal bench guys. Setina, Juzang, and Brooks all played very well today. They all have their flaws, especially defensively, but they gave Kentucky really, really GREAT minutes when they desperately needed it. All three of these guys played as hard as I├втВмтДвve seen anyone play all season. They deserve the credit for keeping UK from getting blown out in this one. That├втВмтДвs big moving forward because the Cats will need it over the next few weeks. Bench play is huge and they will need to give the starters a breather when necessary. Despite the frustrations today, these guys took advantage of the opportunities they were given. I was ready to say, ├втВм┼УLet├втВмтДвs just throw this one out and forget it happened, deal?├втВм┬Э But this team regrouped and straightened this thing out. What a game and what a win by UK. Go Cats!!!",0,0,0,0
2435,"'Evolving like Pokemon', Hong Kong women step up to protest frontlines","By Pak Yiu HONG KONG (Reuters) - University student 'A', says she used to be a 'typical girl' who liked to shop, drink bubble tea and watch Korean soap operas but all that changed as Hong Kong's anti-government protests gained momentum and she stepped up to take a place in the frontlines. She is now charged with rioting, an offence which carries a maximum ten year jail sentence, and is on bail awaiting trial. The protests began last June and at first, the frontlines were predominantly men. That started to gradually change and women began building roadblocks, throwing back tear gas cannisters as well as facing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds. The 22-year-old, who did not want to be identified for fear it could affect her trial, said her shift to the frontline came in stages. ""I was at the back, I would just go home after I marched. I started to think I could go further and further forward, till I was at the very front."" At the frontlines, it can be hard to tell the difference between men and women among the black-clad protesters but 'A' says she felt a sense of female empowerment and gender equality when she came across other women - even if men sometimes tell women to retreat. In the past nine months, 7,165 people have been arrested, according to the city's Security Bureau. The protests have quietened down due to spread of the coronavirus, but there are signs the movement could again mobilise with at least three protests scheduled for Sunday. Although Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill, which sparked the protests, has been withdrawn, protesters have been marching for an investigation into police brutality and the downgrading of riot charges for those who have been arrested. The student says she believes more women could play a greater role in progressing the campaign for more democratic measures to be put in place across the city. ""Women should also come out for this. Men shouldn't be responsible for everything, women should also take some responsibility,"" she said. ""We're no longer weak, or the ones with 'princess syndrome'. So I think now, we are evolving like Pokemon, we're on another level. We're different.""

Canadian Pacific Railway on Tuesday upped its offer by $2 billion to $27.3 billion in cash and stock in a showdown with larger rival Canadian National Railway. That drove shares of Kansas City up 7% in early trading. Canadian Pacific shares fell, while Canadian National├втВмтДвs rose. It all started in March, when Canadian Pacific reached a $25 billion deal to acquire Kansas City in the hopes of creating the first railroad linking Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. One month later, Canadian National swooped in with a higher bid. It and Kansas City then agreed on a nearly $30 billion deal that├втВмтДвs set for a shareholder vote on August 19. Canadian Pacific├втВмтДвs move marks a U-turn, since the second-biggest Canadian railroad operator had vowed in April not to raise its bid. Still, its latest offer is lower than that of Canadian National. Canadian Pacific has said its rival├втВмтДвs offer would reduce competition and negatively impact shippers. Kansas City and Canadian National were not immediately available for comment.

2438,Staten Island Amazon worker who planned protest amid coronavirus is fired,"Staten Island Amazon workers walk out STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The worker who helped organize a walkout at Staten Island├втВмтДвs Amazon fulfillment center on Monday said later in the day that he was fired by the company. Workers at the Bloomfield-based fulfillment center walked out during their lunch break to protest working conditions during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. With city police officers making sure protestors maintained a six-foot distance from each other, at least 50 people took part in the rally in front of the facility, known as JFK8 -- which has 5,000 workers. The facility is Staten Island├втВмтДвs largest employer. The rally├втВмтДвs organizer, Chris Smalls, an employee at the facility, said he was fired today. ├втВм┼УAmazon would rather fire workers than face up to its total failure to do what it should to keep us, our families, and our communities safe,"" said Smalls. ""I am outraged and disappointed, but I├втВмтДвm not shocked. As usual, Amazon would rather sweep a problem under the rug than act to keep workers and working communities safe. Today, I stood with my co-workers because conditions at JFK8 are legitimately dangerous for workers and the public. Amazon thinks this might shut me up, but I├втВмтДвm going to keep speaking up. My colleagues in New York and all around the country are going to keep speaking up. We won├втВмтДвt stop until Amazon provides real protections for our health and safety and clarity for everybody about what it is doing to keep people safe in the middle of the worst pandemic of our lifetimes,├втВм┬Э he added. However, Amazon said in a statement to the Advance/SILive.com that Smalls was released of his duties because he violated social distancing guidelines. ├втВм┼УMr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines and putting the safety of others at risk. He was also found to have had close contact with a diagnosed associate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and was asked to remain home with pay for 14 days, which is a measure we├втВмтДвre taking at sites around the world,"" said Amazon in a statement. ├втВм┼УDespite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, March 30, further putting the teams at risk. This is unacceptable and we have terminated his employment as a result of these multiple safety issues,├втВм┬Э she added. In response to the termination, Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said: ├втВм┼УWorkers should be protected when speaking out about safety conditions during this crisis. They are performing a public service. It is unacceptable that Amazon has terminated Chris Smalls for doing that today rather than addressing their serious COVID-19 safety problems.├втВм┬Э While Amazon workers on Staten Island are not unionized, they have sought to form a union in the past. Some of the groups that sponsored the protest on Monday also issued a joint statement about Smalls being fired. ├втВм┼УAmazon will give a lot of reasons for why Chris Smalls was fired today. But the facts stand: at midday today, Chris stood up and called out Amazon for failing to protect our safety and our health. Hours later, he was fired,"" said a joint statement from Athena Coalition director Dania Rajendra, Make the Road NY co-executive director Deborah Axt and New York Communities for Change director Jonathan Westin. ├втВм┼УChris, along with many of his colleagues in New York and around the country, have dared to tell the truth about the dangerous conditions at Amazon facilities. We can only conclude that instead of listening to the people who are actually risking their lives on the frontlines, Amazon would rather they just shut up about Amazon working conditions, which are now a national public health concern,├втВм┬Э said the joint statement. MONDAY├втВмтДвS WALK OUT Amazon workers said they were protesting on Monday because the facility, known as JFK8, was not closed for deep cleaning after sources said that multiple workers had contracted the coronavirus. While it appeared there were at least 50 protesters at the walk out, Amazon said only about 15 of them were employed at the facility. A spokesperson for the Amazon facility wouldn├втВмтДвt confirm the number of coronavirus cases and told the Advance on Saturday that the facility would not be closed for deep cleaning. Amazon said the confirmed cases at JFK8 are not linked to one another. And the workers who contracted the virus had no contact with each other, the company said. ├втВм┼УWorkers are really scared right now. As of this morning, it looks like there is another case in the warehouse. This brings it up to six or seven cases,├втВм┬Э said Zack Lerner, the organizing director of New York Communities for Change, which helped stage the walkout with Made The Road New York. Both are grassroots organizations. Lerner claimed management didn├втВмтДвt make employees aware of the confirmed cases. *** CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CORONAVIRUS IN NEW YORK *** RELATED COVERAGE Amazon workers protest working conditions amid coronavirus outbreak Amazon workers plan walkout at Staten Island facility Monday due to coronavirus S.I.

2557,Felon Busted With Guns On The Way To Salt Lake City Protest,"A pair of Utah men are behind bars after police found numerous weapons and social media posts threatening violence against officers. Authorities in West Valley, Utah say 27-year olds Yuri Silva and Christian Hernandez were pulled over on their way to a protest in Salt Lake City, and cops found several firearms in their vehicle, including what the Deseret News describes as an Uzi with a suppressor. In the home of Yuri Neves Silva, 27, of West Valley City, more weapons were found and seized. Information about a potential motive was not immediately available, but police believe the two were headed to the protests to cause trouble. ├втВм┼УWe had every reason to believe that├втВмтДвs what they intended to do,├втВм┬Э Vainuku said. Silva had posted ├втВм┼Уmultiple threats of violence against police, specifically Salt Lake City police and West Valley City police├втВм┬Э over social media and ├втВм┼Уencouraged others to take up arms against police as well, and had reportedly listed the names and addresses of specific officers to be targeted,├втВм┬Э she said. Silva was arrested for investigation of making a terroristic threat. Police say Silva was making multiple posts about harming police officers and was seen in one picture holding a gun, according to a police affidavit. Silva├втВмтДвs not a prohibited person, but the same can├втВмтДвt be said for his buddy. Christian Hernandez is now facing felon in possession and drug charges after marijuana was found in the vehicle along with the firearms. As for Silva├втВмтДвs alleged threats, they seem to be pretty specific in their intent. ├втВм┼УIn one video posted on (Sunday), the suspect made a video showing himself mocking the Salt Lake City curfew, stating, ├втВм╦ЬHands up don├втВмтДвt shoot,├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э while also threatening to kill police officers, the affidavit states. ├втВм┼УThe suspect also made comments knowing officers were trying to follow his Facebook page and he directed officers to stay at home to protect their families, otherwise ├втВм╦Ьwe will have no choice but to affiliate you with your ├втВм┬ж colleagues and their actions.├втВмтДв ├втВм┼УThe suspect also mentions a police officer who resides in his neighborhood and comments, ├втВм╦ЬYou put that cop car in the garage real quick play boi,├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э according to the affidavit. According to police, Silva denies that he had any actual intent to harm police officers, but admitted that he hoped his social media posts would incite others to violence. That excuse may have been more believable if Silva and Hernandez hadn├втВмтДвt had multiple firearms with them on their way to what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. Thankfully, things seem to be calming down in Salt Lake City after a weekend of violence. Protests on Tuesday were loud but lawful for the most part. One person was arrested at the state capitol after protests continued long past the curfew imposed by the mayor, but that was it. If Silva and Hernandez hadn├втВмтДвt been apprehended, however, who knows how bad things would have gotten. The legitimate protesters may have issues with police, but they should be praising officers for their actions in thwarting what very well could have turned a peaceful protest into a bloodbath.

2597,"Extinction Rebellion Protests ""Climate Abuse"" With Topless Human Chain On International Women's Day ├втА╣тАа Elizabeth Johnston","Extinction Rebellion has done it again. It seems there├втВмтДвs no deed to embarrassing or asinine for this particular brand of climate hysteric to commit in their deluded plot to save humanity from global warming. While you might know them for gluing themselves to planes, trains, buildings, roads, and the gates of Downing Street, 31 female members of the group opted for a protest befitting the International Women├втВмтДвs Day on which it occurred: a topless human chain. Because what could possibly spread awareness and call world leaders to action better than a bunch of women standing around half-naked in the middle of a winter day in London? According to the Metro, the women stood on Waterloo Bridge with ├втВм┼Уclimate rape├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼Уclimate murder├втВм┬Э and other slogans painted on their bare chests. Sarah Mintram, a former teacher and participant in the protest explained that the rationale behind the topless protest is the dubious fact that women are suffering more than men due to violence caused by climate change. Yeah. Really. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs mainly women in poorer countries in the global south that are experiencing the increase in violence but this will be the reality for all women if the climate and ecological crisis continues to go unaddressed,├втВм┬Э Mintram said. ├втВм┼УWe are here to raise the alarm about what is happening to our sisters around the world and to tell women in the UK the climate and ecological emergency is your issue,├втВм┬Э she continued, ├втВм┼УIt will affect you as a woman if we do not persuade our government to take urgent action starting now.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УAs part of a series of actions around the world, XR UK women formed a topless chain across Waterloo Bridge to highlight the vulnerability of women in the face of climate breakdown,├втВм┬Э the group said in a tweet sharing the photos.  ├втВм┼УThe climate emergency is a women├втВмтДвs emergency,├втВм┬Э the group continued. ├втВм┼УWe are here to highlight the increase in hardship, violence & rape already facing women in the global south as a result of the climate & ecological emergency.├втВм┬Э  ├втВм┼УWhy is climate a women├втВмтДвs issue? A January 2020 report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that climate breakdown and environmental degradation are driving an increase in violence against women,├втВм┬Э Extinction Rebellion said in a tweet explaining the protest. They cited a January 2020 report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which claimed that climate change was responsible for violence against women in the Southern Hemisphere. ├втВм┼УThe report found that deforestation and the degradation of land mean women have to travel further to collect the things they need, like firewood, and are exposed to violence, rape and abduction when they make these journeys,├втВм┬Э the group continued. According to Breitbart, Extinction Rebellion has been plaguing London├втВмтДвs Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for years. Their antics cost the capitol├втВмтДвs police force├втВмтАЭand therefore taxpayers├втВмтАЭan estimated ├В┬г37 million last year alone, more than double the ├В┬г15 million annual budget for the Violent Crime Taskforce. I cannot wait for the next few decades to go by only for these folks to realize that they├втВмтДвve fallen for a complete and utter hoax. Well, those who survive any future attempts to glue themselves to public transportation vehicles, anyway.

2615,Petrol Bomb Hurled Near Shaheen Bagh Anti-CAA Protest Site,"the fully loaded magazine A petrol bomb was hurled by an unidentified person near the protest site at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday where women have been on a sit-in for over three months against the newly amended citizenship act, police said. No injuries have been reported. The incident took place at around 9.30 am, they said. A police team has found five-six petrol-filled bottles at the site. The protest against the CAA and proposed NRC continue at Shaheen Bagh despite the 'Janata Curfew' called by the Prime Minister. PM Modi has urged all the people across the country to stay indoors on Sunday to break the chain of transmission of Coronavirus. However, the protesters at Shaheen Bagh have defied the call and continued their protest against CAA. Petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court seeking removal of the protestors to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Image supplied The town of Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) continues to burn, with attacks on trucks during the week followed up with the setting alight of six out of seven cars at the town├втВмтДвs Social Development offices. Protestors in Ladysmith KZN. Government vehicles set on fire. pic.twitter.com/fy69KbkHrJ Protests have been ongoing in Ladysmith since February, with incensed residents calling for the head of fraud and corruption accused Alfred Duma local municipality mayor Vincent Madlala, as well as bemoaning poor service delivery, water shortages and escalating violence between warring taxi associations. The Department of Social Development vehicles were torched on Wednesday evening, and although there is currently no leads on who the culprits are, eNCA report that evidence points to a petrol bomb attack. Roads going in and out of town have been barricaded with the carcasses of burnt-out trucks and minibus taxis that continue to enforce a total shutdown in the area. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala decried the loss of nearly R2 million a day with businesses, factories and transport operators rendered utterly unable to function amid the chaos. KZN MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the perpetrators of the attack on the government vehicles to be swiftly brought to justice. ├втВм┼УThe department has received a report and seen pictures with its six vehicles burnt by brazen criminals,├втВм┬Э said Khoza. ├втВм┼УWe are shocked at this despicable act of vandalism, which is totally abhorrent, destructive and beyond any justification whatsoever.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УThese vehicles are an important tool used to quickly respond and provide services to our needy communities,├втВм┬Э she said. She said that the crime was just another in a long line of threatening acts committed against government employees in the area. ├втВм┼УThe torching of our vehicles is another form of threatening employees who have suffered a lot of hijackings in the past.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УThe law must take its course wherever and whenever our properties are under threat. We urge police to investigate such criminal activities without fear or favour. No-one should do these despicable and morally reprehensible acts, despite any frustration,├втВм┬Э she said.

The Patiala House Courts later sent Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia alumni president who was arrested on Sunday, to 10-day police custody. ├втВм┼УFrom the interrogation of witnesses, it is revealed that accused Shifa Ur Rehman received funds from members of alumni association of Jamia Millia Islamia based in Middle East countries and he was co-coordinating at the protest sites,"" the Delhi police said in its application demanding custody of Rahman. Police said Rahman's name had popped up during the questioning of Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Safora Zargar, Gulfisa, Tahir Hussain, and three members of the Popular Front of India (PFI). ""Shifa-Ul-Rehman is also found actively involved in a conspiracy hatched in setting up anti CAA/NPR/NRC protests at various sites in Delhi, giving hate speeches that led to the riots in February 2020 at various protest sites, i.e., Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur, Khureji, Inderlok and Hauz Rani,"" it said. According to police, Rehman along with AAJMI members namely Areeb and Badre Alam and other members of Jamia Co-ordination Committee (JCC), had visited various protest sites in Delhi. The Delhi police told the court that during the investigation, names of some more suspects have come out and the accused should be questioned at length about those suspects to obtain their exact particulars. ├втВм┼УHuge money was also funded as well as spent by the conspirators to carry out these riots in Delhi,"" the police said, adding that the custodial interrogation of Rahman is required to confront him with huge technical data and other evidence collected during investigation. At least 53 people died in Delhi in February as those opposing and favouring the new citizenship law clashed each other, leaving a trail of destruction in several areas of the national capital. The Special Cell of the Delhi Police is probing the larger conspiracy behind the riots. Copyright ├В┬й 2021 All rights reserved",1,3,0,0

Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate. Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing ├втВмтАЭ very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities. To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

2945,Coronavirus: Fox News hosts keep telling people to go and protest 'for their freedom' instead of social distancing,"As social distancing and lockdown measures are extended in many countries, people are starting to get frustrated. In some instances ├втВмтАЬ instead of staying inside, or writing to their representatives ├втВмтАЬ people are starting to defy lockdown and hold physical protests. Fox News hosts are among those encouraging people to carry out physical protests against stay-at-home orders, potentially endangering the lives of countless others. In Michigan, a mass protest was organised in defiance of the governor├втВмтДвs stay-at-home orders. Recent figures put the number of deaths in Michigan at 1,900. Laura Ingraham, a prominent host on FOX news, tweeted in approval and suggested that the same may start to happen in other states. Initially, protesters were supposed to create traffic gridlock and hold signs from their cars, but a group gathered on the steps of Michigan├втВмтДвs city hall. They said that the damage caused by the economic impact of stay-at-home orders was greater than the damage caused by Covid-19. Other Fox News hosts, such as Jeanine Pirro, expressed similar sentiments on TV, saying that health officials had ""overblown sentiments"" and that the American spirit would not ├втВм╦Ьtake it├втВмтДв. She also said that what had happened in Lansing, Michigan, would start to happen all over the country. On the Fox news website, coverage of protests featured prominently. Ingraham, Pirro and a number of other Fox News hosts were calling for stricter lockdown measures and more guidance from central government towards the end of March, although they appear to have changed their mind after a few weeks. There├втВмтДвs little evidence to suggest that any states in the US have reached a peak in Covid-19 cases. Other prominent personalities in right-wing media have expressed frustration at public health measures ├втВмтАЬ pro-Trump commentator Candace Owens tweeted in anger after being asked to wear a mask in a supermarket (she also said that she had been going every day). Similar protests have taken place in Vancouver, Canada, where a small group of people gathered to protest what they saw as government overreach, and were promptly fined or arrested.

3072,"Majority of Michigan residents support Governor Whitmer's coronavirus response, despite anti-lockdown protests, poll shows","The majority of Michigan residents approve of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, despite last week's large protest against the state's stringent stay-at-home order, polling has shown. The new survey, published Monday and conducted by the Detroit Regional Chamber, found that 57 percent of respondents approved of Whitmer's coronavirus response in Michigan, while just 37 percent disapproved. Meanwhile, only 44 percent of those polled approved of President Donald Trump's response to the crisis, while 50 percent disapproved. Among those surveyed, 39 percent self-identified as Democrats, while 35 percent identified as Republicans and 26 percent said they were independents. In total, 600 Michigan residents were polled. Last Wednesday, thousands of protesters descended on Lansing to demonstrate against the social-distancing requirements put in place by Michigan's Democratic governor. While organizers encouraged demonstrators to remain in their cars as they drove through the city holding signs and waving flags, some protesters exited their vehicles and disregarded social distancing measures. Demonstrators held signs that read: ""Security Without Liberty Is Called Prison,"" ""Liberty Once Lost Is Lost Forever"" and ""Recall Whitmer,"" USA Today reported. Trump later voiced his support for the anti-social-distancing protests in Michigan as well as in other states around the country. ""Liberate Michigan!"" the president tweeted on Friday. ""A small segment of the state is protesting, and that's their right,"" Whitmer told CNN on Wednesday. ""The sad part is, though, that the more that they're out and about, the more likely they are to spread COVID-19 and the more likely we're going to have to take this posture for a longer period of time,"" she warned. As of early Monday afternoon, Michigan had more than 30,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Of those, 2,374 people have died. Tori Meyer, a resident of Berrien County in southwest Michigan, told Newsweek that she supported Whitmer's stay-at-home order and believed the governor was taking appropriate steps to protect the people of her state. ""Hands down, I trust Whitmer more than Trump,"" Meyer, 30, said. ""Instead of leading us, he's gone back and forth with his stance on the coronavirus, refuses to fully address the issues and instead let the states fight it out with each other, so to speak."" Meyer said she wasn't surprised that people had protested the lockdown but felt embarrassed by the demonstrations. ""It's embarrassing for others to see that and think maybe all Michiganders are that way,"" Meyer said. ""No one wants to be stuck at home right now, but I look at this as my civic duty. Is it inconvenient and kind of boring? Yes. But the more we are all in this together and staying home, the faster this will be over."" She also said she was ""infuriated"" by Trump's tweet about Michigan. ""He's fanning the flames and blatantly inciting violence in our state, which is the last thing we need right now,"" Meyer told Newsweek. Several governors have criticized Trump for supporting the demonstrations against social-distancing measures. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, who faced a similar protest in Annapolis on Saturday, told CNN on Sunday that the demonstrators were essentially protesting against guidelines laid out by the White House. ""So then to encourage people to go protest, the plan that you just made recommendations on on Thursday, it just doesn't make any sense,"" Hogan said. ""We're sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations."" National polling has shown that the majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders, with most respondents more concerned that the government will move too quickly to reopen the economy than too slowly. A survey released Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed that 58 percent of respondents were concerned that the U.S. would ease stay-at-home guidance too quickly, while only 32 percent said they were concerned the economy wouldn't be reopened quickly enough. A similar poll released last week by Pew Research Center found that 66 percent were concerned that state governments would be too quick to ease their coronavirus restrictions.

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. In tandem with Donald Trump, Fox News hosts and other influential conservatives spent the weekend egging on a small number of mask-less protesters flouting social distancing guidelines by crowding state capitols and demanding that closure orders be lifted. These ├втВм┼УGive me liberty and give me death!├втВм┬Э rallies, as a Washington Post satire piece put it, represent the opinions of a decided minority: A Politico├втВмтАЬMorning Consult poll released last week found that 81% of Americans support maintaining social distancing measures ├втВм┼Уfor as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy,├втВм┬Э while nearly 60% of respondents in a similar NBC├втВмтАЬWall Street Journal survey voiced concerns over the U.S. lifting mitigation efforts too soon. But perhaps out of wishful thinking, members of the right-wing media are nonetheless framing protests as the Tea Party movement reincarnated. ├втВм┼УA lot of people are very proud of you,├втВм┬Э said Fox News host Jeanine Pirro during a Saturday night interview with Meshawn Maddock, an organizer behind the so-called ├втВм┼УOperation Gridlock├втВм┬Э protest in Lansing, Michigan. ├втВм┼УPeaceful protests, civil liberties, it├втВмтДвs what we├втВмтДвre all about. Keep going.├втВм┬Э The segment aired after Pirro├втВмтДвs colleagues had spent days praising the protests. Last week Tucker Carlson hosted Maddock and thanked the Michigan Conservative Coalition activist for her service. On Saturday morning Fox & Friends prominently displayed the locations of future rallies on a map of the country├втВмтАЭexactly what the network did years prior to promote the anti-Obama Tea Party protests. An article published on Fox├втВмтДвs website took the effort a step further, embedding a tweet with contact information for those who wished to join the Wisconsin Freedom Rally. On Friday conservative talk radio giant Rush Limbaugh cheered on the protesters by citing historic examples of American bravery and sacrifice, including U.S. involvement ├втВм┼Уin World War II,├втВм┬Э adding, ├втВм┼УThis shutdown, and hunkering down in total fear, is not a hallmark of American history.├втВм┬Э Moving in lockstep with his media allies, the president has personally incited the protests, writing in three separate tweets on Friday, ├втВм┼УLIBERATE MINNESOTA,├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УLIBERATE MICHIGAN,├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼УLIBERATE VIRGINIA...save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!├втВм┬Э Speaking at the White House├втВмтДвs coronavirus task force briefing on Sunday, Trump doubled down, calling the protesters ├втВм┼Уa very orderly group of people,├втВм┬Э despite the fact that some flew Confederate flags and flashed signs with swastikas, and falsely claiming that protesters ├втВм┼Уwere all six feet apart,├втВм┬Э despite an abundance of photo and video evidence to the contrary. ├втВм┼УTheir life was taken away from them. They want their life back,├втВм┬Э he concluded. Responding to a question on the protesters├втВмтДв use of Nazi symbolism, the president delivered a remark reminiscent of his infamous ├втВм┼Уvery fine people on both sides├втВм┬Э line following a 2017 white nationalist rally: ├втВм┼УWell that, I totally would say, no way. But I didn├втВмтДвt see that.├втВм┬Э Trump├втВмтДвs outspoken support marks the latest flashpoint in the White House├втВмтДвs ongoing war with states amid the pandemic. A number of governors aired their opposition to Trump├втВмтДвs comments throughout Sunday, including Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who asserted that now is ├втВм┼Уnot the time for protests, this is not the time for divisiveness├втВм┬Э; and Washington governor Jay Inslee, who condemned Trump├втВмтДвs fostering of ├втВм┼Уillegal activity├втВм┬Э and said, ├втВм┼УIt is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.├втВм┬Э Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, the right├втВмтДвs primary target in their justification of the rallies, did not directly address them, but she did explain why some in Michigan are failing to grok the reasoning behind social distancing policies. ├втВм┼УThe hard part of public health is when you├втВмтДвre doing a good job, you├втВмтДвre saving lives, and it├втВмтДвs hard to quantify precisely what that looks like,├втВм┬Э she told CNN. And Maryland governor Larry Hogan noted that it is not ├втВм┼Уhelpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the president├втВмтДвs own policy.├втВм┬ж You can├втВмтДвt start to reopen under his plan until you have declining numbers for 14 days, which those states and my state do not have.├втВм┬Э Hogan├втВмтДвs deputy communications director also noted that Monday├втВмтДвs Reopen Maryland├втВмтАЬorganized rally in Annapolis saw ├втВм┼Уmore media inquiries├втВм┬Э than actual protesters. Indeed, the gatherings have typically featured attendees in the dozens or low triple figures, making Michigan├втВмтДвs Thursday crowd of roughly 3,000 an outlier. Though the likes of Fox have framed the protests as an organic grassroots push, a good number have been organized through a network of Facebook pages that appear to have been launched by a right-wing activist family known for using pro-gun and anti-abortion social media posts to harvest data, per reports from the Washington Post and NBC News. Aaron, Ben, Chris, and Matthew Dorr are reportedly behind pages that have accumulated more than 200,000 members in total, such as New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine and Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine. However, given Facebook├втВмтДвs newly announced ban on groups advocating for social distancing violations, it├втВмтДвs unclear how much longer these groups will be allowed to exist on the platform. The family declined requests for comment from NBC News and the Post, but Ben Dorr called accusations of them running a scam operation ├втВм┼Уfake news├втВм┬Э in a response to the Philadelphia Inquirer. In one of the Dorrs├втВмтДв most successful pushes, over 100,000 Facebook users have joined a Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantines group, and at least 300 of those members RSVP├втВмтДвd for an ├втВм┼УOperation Gridlock├втВм┬Э protest next week. (The group├втВмтДвs creator, Ben Dorr, lives in Iowa, NBC News found.) The scheduled rally is a rip-off of Michigan├втВмтДвs ├втВм┼УOperation Gridlock,├втВм┬Э which was staged by a group backed by the billionaire family of Trump├втВмтДвs education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Trump blamed the governors for instigating the backlash, casting their shutdown policies as extreme, even though many are in accordance with recommendations from the White House├втВмтДвs own Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ├втВм┼УIf people feel that way, you├втВмтДвre allowed to protest. Some governors have gone too far, some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate,├втВм┬Э he told reporters on Sunday.

3151,Hundreds gather to protest Harris County face mask order,"LIVE Phil Archer, Reporter Published: April 23, 2020 8:01 pm Phil Archer, Reporter HOUSTON ├втВмтАЬ Hundreds of protestors expressed their anger toward Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo├втВмтДвs order requiring all county residents to wear face masks in public. The large group gathered outside the Harris County Administration Building in downtown Houston Wednesday. The protest, similar to others taking place across the country, highlighted the growing tension between personal liberty and public health in a time of national crisis. About 200 people carrying signs, flags and bull horns gathered on the sidewalk. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm tired of the government trying to tell us what to do,"" said protestor Marga Matthews. The protest was organized by longtime conservative activist Dr. Steven Hotze and attorney Jared Woodfill, the former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. They also filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to block the order requiring all county residents to wear face masks, to wash their hands, and to not touch their faces for 30 days on pain of a one thousand dollars fine. Their lawsuit contends Judge Hidalgo├втВмтДвs order is unconstitutional and an overreach of her power. ├втВм┼УThe order that we├втВмтДвre dealing with right now we believe is an unconstitutional, trampling and infringement on our liberties,├втВм┬Э Woodfill said. ├втВм┼УThis is one individual who is dictating from her office over there on Preston as to what we can or can├втВмтДвt do.├втВм┬Э In opposition, the county attorney says the Texas Constitution gives the judge broad power during an emergency to implement public health measures such as quarantine and the wearing of face masks. ├втВм┼УThere├втВмтДвs no constitutional right not to wash your hands; no constitutional right during a pandemic to be allowed to spread a deadly virus to other people,"" Assistant Harris County Attorney Seth Hopkins said. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs reasonable, during this transition phase, to ask people to cover their mouths. Similar laws were declared constitutional during the 1918 pandemic. They were constitutional then, they├втВмтДвre constitutional today.├втВм┬Э The judge├втВмтДвs order follows recommendations from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already being followed in Dallas and Bexar counties. Other Texas counties, like Galveston and Montgomery counties are opposing the measure on constitutional grounds. But medical experts like Dr. Joseph Varon who treat virus victims at the United Memorial Medical Center in north Houston say requiring face masks makes sense. ├втВм┼УSome of my own friends are not happy with this idea.├втВм┬Э Dr. Varon said. ├втВм┼УThis is a measure that may prevent more spreading of the COVID. As it is right now, we├втВмтДвre still in a crisis, we├втВмтДвre still not over this hump. And this will prevent more cases."" Copyright 2020 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.

3256,Washington anglers protest coronavirus fishing closure,"Protest planned Sunday in Olympia, Washington RICHLAND, Wash. -- Protesters in boats and on shore Saturday demanded that restrictions on recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting in Washington because of the coronavirus be lifted.About 50 boats along with several hundred protesters on shore gathered on Saturday around Columbia Point Marina in Richland in southeastern Washington. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife on March 25 temporarily closed recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.But the protesters say the restrictions should be lifted because anglers can practice social distancing while fishing. They said kayakers, jet skis, wake boarders, pleasure boaters and others are on the water.├втВм┼УThere├втВмтДвs nobody but us two out in the middle of the river,├втВм┬Э Alan Doughty told the Tri-City Herald.

We├втВмтДвve got insurance, and we can├втВмтДвt use it,├втВм┬ЭBen Hanes organized the protest after noticing non-fishing boaters on the water and believed the restrictions on fishing were unfair.├втВм┼УThe anglers of Washington state aren├втВмтДвt going to put up with (the ban) much longer,├втВм┬Э he said.Al Bernicker, 74, regularly comes to Columbia Point to fish.

Angry demonstrators took to the streets in North Carolina and Missouri on Tuesday to voice their discontent at their states├втВмтДв stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. The protests in Raleigh, N.C. and Jefferson City, Mo., are the latest in a series of protests across the country against state lockdown orders ├втВмтАЬ fueled by tweets of support from President Trump and the economic unease caused by the coronavirus. Holding handmade signs with slogans like ├втВм┼УMy Rights Are Essential├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼УReOpenNC,├втВм┬Э hundreds of people marched through downtown Raleigh while chanting ├втВм┼УFreedom Now.├втВм┬Э Most of the people at the protest were not wearing masks and were ignoring orders to maintain social distancing practices. Similar signs along with a slew of American flags were seen as people began to gather outside the Missouri Capitol building, although the protestors seemed to be trying to maintain better social distancing than in North Carolina. Protests against the lockdown orders have cropped up in numerous states over the past few weeks as some Americans have become frustrated with being told to stay at home and with the economic freefall the virus has caused. The federal government said Thursday that 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the four-week total to about 22 million out of a work force of 159 million ├втВмтАЭ easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record. The losses translate to about one in seven workers. Last week, hundreds of cars, trucks and SUVs descended on Michigan├втВмтДвs state capital Wednesday afternoon as part of a noisy protest against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer├втВмтДвs social-distancing restrictions that critics say have gone too far. The same day, a number of people gathered outside the Kentucky Capitol building to protest Gov. Andy Beshear├втВмтДвs shutdown orders, while more gathered in Virginia to protest on Thursday. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Several hundred people rallied in Texas' capital over the weekend, chanting ├втВм┼УLet us work!├втВм┬Э Many clamored for an immediate lifting of restrictions in a state where more than 1 million have filed for unemployment since the crisis began. The rally was organized by a host of Infowars, owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who joined protesters on the Capitol steps. Jones is being sued in Austin over using his show to promote falsehoods that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut was a hoax. In Indianapolis, more than 200 people stood close together outside the governor's mansion, carrying American flags and signs demanding that Gov. Holcomb lift restrictions. Indiana's state health department reported 529 new cases between April 7 and midday Friday, raising the total to more than 10,600. The number of deaths rose by 26, to 545. Elsewhere, a few hundred demonstrators waved signs outside the Statehouse in New Hampshire, which has had nearly 1,300 cases of the virus and more than three dozen deaths. More protests this week are planned in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin. TRUMP ├втВм╦ЬFOMENTING DOMESTIC REBELLION,├втВмтДв DEM GOVERNOR INSLEE SAYS While many governors have pleaded with their constituents to not protest during the public health crisis as it may only cause more people to get sick, the demonstrations ├втВмтАЬ mainly organized by conservative groups ├втВмтАЬ have found an ally in the president. ├втВм┼УLIBERATE MINNESOTA!├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УLIBERATE MICHIGAN!├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УLIBERATE VIRGINIA,├втВм┬Э Trump said in a tweet-storm in over the weekend in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Four states ├втВмтАЬ Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas ├втВмтАЬ already have lifted some restrictions or plan to this week. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, gave the green light for some outdoor areas in the state to reopen late last week even as he cautioned that social distancing guidelines should remain in place. Florida has been one of the state├втВмтДвs hardest hit by the contagion, with almost 26,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 764 deaths. The state was one of the last in the nation to order a lockdown and was heavily criticized for leaving beaches open during part of the spring break period last month. But by late Friday afternoon, thousands of people flooded the beaches in places like Jacksonville after they reopened despite pleas from mayors to practice safe social distancing measures. In nearby South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is set to announce on Monday the reopening of state beaches and some retail stores. McMaster already reinstated last Friday access to public boat ramps and landings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced over the weekend that state parks will reopen for recreational activity on Monday, so long as citizens wear masks and maintain a distance of six feet from each other. Subsequent measures will allow hospitals to resume elective tests and surgeries while stores can start ├втВм┼Уretail to go├втВм┬Э services, starting on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Despite the protests and opening up of some states, many lawmakers and public health officials warn that the country is far from safe when it comes to dealing with the virus. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has recorded more than 788,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that over 39,000 people in the country have died for the disease. Public Health officials have said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of the infected is crucial before easing restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.

3542,The Extremists And Grifters Behind Many Of The Anti-Lockdown Protests,"Many of the right-wing protests against state stay-at-home orders sweeping the nation have been organized or attended by white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, anti-government militias, members of a neo-fascist street gang, and other assorted extremists and scam artists, a HuffPost analysis shows. The protests, largely coordinated on Facebook, have seen crowds of hundreds descend upon state and city government buildings, where participants flagrantly flout social distancing guidelines to demand that their respective governors reopen state businesses during a deadly pandemic. Images of these often heavily armed protesters, screaming at health care workers and blocking ambulances from reaching hospitals, have gone viral, shocking a country where polls show a large majority support measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has already killed over 45,000 people in this country. Yet the events ├втВмтАЭ which present a clear danger to communities across the U.S., risking the further spread of a virus ├втВмтАЭ have been promoted extensively by Fox News. On Friday, immediately after a Fox segment sympathetic to the rallies, the president tweeted out his support for the protesters. ├втВм┼УLIBERATE MINNESOTA!├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УLIBERATE MICHIGAN!├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УLIBERATE VIRGINIA,├втВм┬Э Trump wrote in a tweet-storm, directly contradicting the advice of the medical experts on his own COVID-19 task force. It├втВмтДвs easy to see why footage of the protests might excite the president. They bear a striking resemblance, after all, to his own fascist campaign rallies, with attendees who are almost uniformly white, and who display a deep devotion to the president, donning red MAGA hats and waving Trump 2020 flags. And like Trump├втВмтДвs rallies, the anti-shutdown protests are teeming with right-wing extremists. Here├втВмтДвs a brief look at some of the figures who have either organized or attended these events over the last week. A rally Monday in Augusta, the state capital of Maine, was organized in part by Larry Lockman, a white nationalist former state lawmaker who in 2017 warned that proposed immigrant welcome centers were tantamount to a ├втВм┼Уwar on whites.├втВм┬Э According to Maine-based journalist Nathan Bernard, Lockman helped coordinate Monday├втВмтДвs anti-shutdown event on the ├втВм┼УMainers Against Excessive Quarantine├втВм┬Э Facebook page, where he encouraged attendees to show up to the rally wearing MAGA gear. ├втВм┼УThis is about the loss of our civil rights and its impact on our businesses and religion,├втВм┬Э he wrote in one post. Bernard reported seeing Lockman coordinating a group of unmasked protesters at the rally Monday. In Columbus, Ohio, two men were photographed at an anti-shutdown protest holding up an anti-Semitic sign depicting Jews as rats, calling them ├втВм┼Уthe real plague.├втВм┬Э The Anti-Defamation League├втВмтДвs Center on Extremism believes one of the men belongs to the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. According to the ADL, this individual was photographed at a 2019 white power rally with Timothy Wilson, who was killed by federal agents last month during an attempted arrest over his alleged plot to bomb a Missouri hospital during the pandemic in order to attract attention to his white supremacist views. A ├втВм┼УReopen Florida├втВм┬Э protest scheduled for this weekend in Miami was organized by a leader of the neo-fascist street gang The Proud Boys, the Miami New Times reported this week. Enrique Tarrio, a longtime Proud Boy, admitted to the New Times that he├втВмтДвd organized the rally, which he├втВмтДвs advertised as being ├втВм┼Уagainst the Democrat-driven unconstitutional lockdown.├втВм┬Э Members of the Proud Boys ├втВмтАЭ a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group originally founded by bigot Gavin McInnes ├втВмтАЭ have deep ties to a host of white nationalist and militia groups, and are best known for violently attacking their political opponents. Proud Boys have also been spotted at anti-shutdown protests in Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan. At the rally in Lansing, Michigan, Proud Boys were allegedly among the attendees blocking ambulances from being able to reach a hospital. Also in Michigan ├втВмтАЭ as noted by reporter Jason Wilson in The Guardian ├втВмтАЭ were members of the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page Wilson notes ├втВм┼Уfeatures pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front.├втВм┬Э An April 19 rally in Olympia, Washington, was well-attended by other anti-government militia groups, including the Oathkeepers and Three Percenters, whose members have been implicated in multiple anti-Muslim terror plots in recent years. Matt Marshall, leader of a state chapter of the Three Percenters, encouraged attendees ahead of the Olympia rally to wear Hawaiian shirts, a reference to the ├втВм┼УBig Luau,├втВм┬Э which is itself code for the ├втВм┼Уboogaloo,├втВм┬Э a term used in white supremacist, militia and far-right circles to describe the bloody civil war they predict ├втВмтАЭ and often hope ├втВмтАЭ is coming to America. According to the ADL, anti-shutdown protesters in Tennessee and New Hampshire have been spotted holding up signs invoking the boogaloo. ├втВм┼УLiberty or Boogaloo,├втВм┬Э the signs have said, and ├втВм┼УJoin my boog squad.├втВм┬Э In San Diego, an anti-shutdown protest this past Saturday was organized by Roger Ogden, who has previously held a series of far-right rallies in the city in coordination with the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters. ├втВм┼УWe do not believe that the COVID-19 bug represents such an immediate danger to others that constitutional rights should be curtailed,├втВм┬Э Ogden told reporters at the San Diego rally, downplaying the virus as less severe than the flu. (COVID-19 is thought to be 10 times more deadly than the flu.) And in Idaho, rally scheduled for this Friday outside the state capital building in Boise is being advertised by Diego Rodriguez, a pastor and former Republican candidate for the state senate. Rodriguez recently held an Easter Sunday church service ├втВмтАЭ in defiance of social distancing orders in the state ├втВмтАЭ with Ammon Bundy, who led the militia occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. Anti-vaccination extremists, a mainstay of Trump rallies and other far-right events in recent years, have been seen at multiple anti-shutdown protests. An April 14 rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, was organized in part by an anti-vaccination activist named Ashley Smith. ├втВм┼УI am against mandatory vaccination,├втВм┬Э Smith said in an email to The News & Observer. ├втВм┼УThat is a personal right and as a sovereign citizen I have the right to choose what medical procedures I and my children receive. Pandemic status/state of emergency doesn├втВмтДвt change that.├втВм┬Э Public health experts fear the anti-vaxx movement could, once a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, undermine a national inoculation program.

Owen Shroyer, a host on the conspiracy website Infowars, held a ├втВм┼УYou Can├втВмтДвt Close America├втВм┬Э rally in the Texas state capitol last weekend, attracting hundreds of attendees. When Infowars founder Alex Jones arrived with a bullhorn, fans swarmed around him and jostled to shake his hand as Jones declared that the pandemic ├втВмтАЭ which has already killed over 500 people in Texas ├втВмтАЭ is a hoax. Investigations by The Washington Post and NBC News revealed that some of the largest Facebook groups organizing protests across the country were all founded by four brothers with a history exploiting far-right causes to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Dorr brothers ├втВмтАЭ Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew ├втВмтАЭ were the founders or administrators of the groups New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine, Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine, Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine and Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine. According to NBC News, the groups started or administered by the brothers, which have amassed some 200,000 members, direct people to websites owned by the Dorrs, which then directs people to register their names and addresses, or to sign up as dues-paying members for organizations promoting pro-gun, anti-abortion, or pro-Trump causes. But Republicans who have previously crossed paths with the Dorr brothers warn that such fundraisers have little to do with political organizing and more to do with lining the Dorrs├втВмтДв pockets. Minnesota├втВмтДвs Senate Republican Caucus earlier this year warned voters about these Dorr ├втВм┼Уscams.├втВм┬Э And Minnesota Citizens Concerned For Life, a prominent anti-abortion group, states on its website that the ├втВм┼УDorr brothers are established scam artists.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УNothing they say can be believed,├втВм┬Э the website says, ├втВм┼Уand giving them your money will not advance the pro-life cause in any way.├втВм┬Э A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus Stay up to date with our live blog as we cover the COVID-19 pandemic What happens if we end social distancing too soon?

Burke, Virginia residents are surprised to learn that they may be overpaying for auto insurance New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned, citing a need for the state to move on from the sexual harassment scandal that has engulfed his administration. At a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Cuomo continued to deny many of the accusations of unwanted physical contact with women, before explaining that the situation had consumed the state├втВмтДвs attention while officials battled a resurgence of Covid-19. The state├втВмтДвs attorney general, Letitia James, previously released a report finding that sexual harassment accusations against the governor from nearly a dozen women were credible. Gov.

3616,"'A riot is the language of the unheard,' Martin Luther King Jr. explained 53 years ago","Echoes Screenshot/Twitter/The King Center Rioting and looting isn't new in America ├втВмтАЭ and it isn't exclusive to any race. As areas of Minneapolis shifted from peaceful protest against the death of George Floyd to looting, arson, and vandalism on Wednesday and Thursday night, the King Center ├втВмтАЭ founded by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow to promote MLK Jr.'s ""nonviolent philosophy and methodology"" ├втВмтАЭ posted this excerpt from King's 1967 ""The Other America"" speech at Stanford University. Speaking two years after California's Watts riots in August 1965 and race riots in Harlem the previous summer, King spent a few minutes trying to explain the cause of rioting to his predominantly white audience. ├втВм┼УIn the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?├втВм┬Э pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH America has consistently ""taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality"" only to follow it with ""certain backward steps,"" King said. Because of widespread and widely ignored black poverty and racial injustice, ""all of our cities are potentially powder kegs,"" he added, and ""many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots."" King continued: Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. ... But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.

The first thing Hafsa Islam felt Friday morning, when she woke up in a neighborhood filled with acrid smoke, was anger. The restaurant in South Minneapolis that had been her family├втВмтДвs life├втВмтДвs work, Gandhi Mahal, had burned down in protests early Friday morning, days after George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Then Hafsa heard her father, Ruhel Islam, on the phone. ├втВм┼УLet the buildings burn,├втВм┬Э he was saying. ├втВм┼УJustice needs to be served. Put those officers in jail.├втВм┬Э Hearing her father├втВмтДвs words on the phone calmed Hafsa, who said she has always supported the Black Lives Matter movement. ├втВм┼УIt helped me realize what we were there for,├втВм┬Э she said. ├втВм┼УIt has gotten to a point where this is the only way that we can get justice, and we can change the system.├втВм┬Э Hafsa, 18, posted what her father had said on Gandhi Mahal├втВмтДвs Facebook page, hoping to help others understand why there were more important things at stake in the protests than buildings, she said. She was met with an outpouring of support from the community and promises to help the restaurant rebuild. Ruhel, an immigrant from Bangladesh, explained it this way: ├втВм┼УLife is more valuable than anything else,├втВм┬Э he said, hours after his restaurant had burned. ├втВм┼УWe can rebuild a building.

And she had even, she said, caught a glimpse of George Floyd as he was arrested a few blocks away. She was in her car, running DoorDash orders from her family├втВмтДвs restaurant. She even filmed a 5-second video on Snapchat, a blurry video showing police with a man on the corner where Floyd was arrested. ├втВм┼УThe first thing I noticed was his facial expression,├втВм┬Э Hafsa said. ├втВм┼УIt brought that image to my mind. I remembered how he was crying and in pain.├втВм┬Э She has thought of that expression, she said, as she watches the protests unfold in her city. ├втВм┼УI think the people saying that people should stop protesting are wrong,├втВм┬Э she said. The boarded up storefront of Moon Palace books, which was tagged with ""Do Not Burn."" As the protests and violence that erupted over Floyd├втВмтДвs death have reduced much of the south Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd was arrested to rubble, many have used the plight of small business owners as a cudgel against the protesters. To Ruhel, who grew up in a ├втВм┼Уpolice state├втВм┬Э in Bangladesh, the forces that brought down his beloved restaurant were very clear. He places the blame on city leaders and local law enforcement who had failed to arrest the officers involved in Floyd├втВмтДвs death, before the officer who knelt on Floyd├втВмтДвs neck was charged with murder Friday afternoon. The other three officers have not been charged. ├втВм┼УThey could have stopped this,├втВм┬Э Ruhel said. ├втВм┼УThey need to put the police in jail. It should have been solved two, three days ago.├втВм┬Э Other small business owners in Minneapolis have gone out of their way to support the protests, even with their buildings at risk as tensions continue to rise. The owners of Moon Palace, a local bookstore, condemned ├втВм┼Уindifference, violence, and more terrorizing by the police├втВм┬Э in response to Floyd├втВмтДвs death. ├втВм┼УWe so appreciate all of the support we├втВмтДвve been offered over the past two days, but we urge you: do not put yourself at risk to protect our store,├втВм┬Э they wrote on Facebook. ├втВм┼УThe things that may be lost in our building are just things, but your life is priceless, just like George Floyd├втВмтДвs life was priceless.├втВм┬Э Moon Palace's large glass windows were boarded up and tagged with ""Do Not Burn"" after reports emerged that the owners had refused to allow police to stage operations in their parking lot. Hafsa Islam and Ruhel Islam, in their garden. None of this, though, has lessened the pain of the loss of Gandhi Mahal, for Ruhel or for Hafsa. Ruhel tried to protect his building, he said: He stayed there this morning until 1 a.m., when he finally had no choice but to go home. ├втВм┼УMy heart is very broken,├втВм┬Э he said of the damage done to his restaurant. ├втВм┼УWe want justice for our brother, but we don├втВмтДвt want to be destroyed. I see young people's anger. At the end, we believe in peace.├втВм┬Э On Friday, Ruhel tried to examine the damage done to their restaurant. But police were blocking off the streets, he said, and he couldn├втВмтДвt get through. Around him, rubble still smoked. Instead, Ruhel and Hafsa went to the garden that they started nearby, called the Interfaith Garden, where Ruhel has long worked with other community groups to grow fresh vegetables and spices that are served at Gandhi Mahal. Ruhel tended to cilantro, beans, and fenugreek, a medicinal spice. Around them, the smoke was still so heavy that their throats burned. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm going to plant in the garden and pray for everyone,├втВм┬Э Ruhel said. He has told Hafsa not to worry about the loss of their restaurant, which was their main source of income. ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвll figure it out, don├втВмтДвt worry, we├втВмтДвll work together,├втВм┬Э he said he told her. ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre growing a lot of food, vegetables, and I├втВмтДвm not worried. I├втВмтДвm going to start planting and growing and growing to survive.├втВм┬Э Contact Molly Hensley-Clancy at molly.hensley-clancy@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

3705,National Guard support requested by city to combat violent protests in south Minneapolis,"KSTP Updated: May 28, 2020 09:54 AM Created: May 27, 2020 07:49 PM Protests continued into Wednesday night in south Minneapolis, where Chopper 5 captured video of apparent looting at a nearby Target and other area businesses. Fires have sprung up around the area as well. Gov. Tim Walz tweeted late Wednesday night, calling the situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue an ""extremely dangerous situation."" The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone's safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene. The protests are happening in response to the death of George Floyd, who was killed Monday night after an incident that involved Minneapolis Police officers. All four officers involved in the arrest were fired on Tuesday. Protesters were seen on Chopper 5 footage throwing bottles and rocks at law enforcement, while officers responded with rubber bullets, flash bombs and tear gas to push them back. Some looters at the East Lake Street Target location were seen walking out with televisions, rugs and other items from the store. Other looters were seen at a tobacco store, a Dollar Tree and a liquor store. Additionally, Cub Foods and an AutoZone is being looted as well. The AutoZone was set on fire as of 9:30 p.m. It could be seen burning on Chopper 5 video. A source has confirmed to KSTP that the city requested support from the National Guard late Wednesday night to combat the ongoing violent protests. A Target spokesperson made the following statement: ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing our community. We decided to close our Lake Street store earlier today and worked to ensure all of our team members were accounted for and safe. Our focus will remain on our team members├втВмтДв safety and helping our community heal. Until further notice, our store will remain closed."" KSTP has a crew on scene to gather more information. The Minneapolis Police Department said they are aware of what is happening in the area and are working on the matter. They advise all to stay out of the area for the time being. Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith shared her thoughts on the night's protests. I├втВмтДвm praying for peace and healing tonight in Minneapolis, as I hear sirens and explosions across our green city. Our community is in so much pain. Dr. King said, ├втВм┼УI can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love.├втВм┬Э Metro Transit has announced that Routes 5 and 23 are being detoured around the area. Walz also posted a series of tweets earlier Wednesday night calling on people to be peaceful if they choose to protest. If you plan to turn your pain into action by joining a public demonstration, please do so peacefully and safely to protect your own health and the health of the people around you. That├втВмтДвs why I├втВмтДвm pushing for a full, fair, and expeditious investigation that will bring us closer to justice. We must continue to examine and address the systemic inequities and discrimination that led to this incident and far too many that have come before. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted a statement urging others to keep the peace. Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 Minneapolis Senators Jeff Hayden and Patricia Torres Ray also made a joint statement on Thursday saying: ""We, along with our constituents, are deeply heartbroken and outraged by the injustice that occurred in the officer-involved death of George Floyd. As our community continues to grieve and grapple with this incredibly unjustifiable loss of life, we believe in their right to peacefully protest. We have grown increasingly concerned, for the safety of the City of Minneapolis and its residents, as the demonstration has escalated. More than ever, our community must come together during this hard time and in this work to fiercely advocate for the justice that is needed. We are eager to effectively partner with community organizers, leaders, activists, and advocates to prevent the loss of another life due to excessive use of force.""  This is a developing story.

One CNN correspondent was arrested on live television while a photographer has been permanently blinded by a rubber bullet. By Lam Thuy Vo Posted on May 31, 2020, at 4:09 p.m. ET A journalist is seen bleeding after police started firing tear gas and rubber bullets in Minneapolis on Saturday. As protests against police brutality continue around the country, more than a dozen journalists have been injured and arrested by police officers while working. Protests broke out in Minneapolis, then spread around the country, after George Floyd died Monday when a police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Floyd's pleas for his life, saying ├втВм┼УI can├втВмтДвt breathe,├втВм┬Э in an event that was captured on video echoed the killing of Eric Garner and brought renewed attention to the violence people of color face from police. Since then, journalists have been documenting the crowds of thousands who have gathered in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Seattle. ├втВм┼УTargeted attacks on journalists, media crews, and news organizations covering the demonstrations show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them,├втВм┬Э said Carlos Mart├Г┬нnez de la Serna of the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement condemning police actions. ├втВм┼УAuthorities in cities across the U.S. need to instruct police not to target journalists and ensure they can report safely on the protests without fear of injury or retaliation.├втВм┬Э Below are some of the injuries and arrests that have been captured through videos and images. Minneapolis Journalists from several news organizations have reported on social media that police have either arrested, harassed, or fired upon them with less-than-lethal force while covering ongoing protests. Minnesota police arrest CNN reporter and camera crew as they report from protests in Minneapolis https://t.co/oZdqBti776 On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew were arrested live on camera, despite identifying themselves as journalists and offering to move. They were released from police custody a few hours later. LA Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske posted a video of herself describing an encounter with Minnesota State Patrol officers during which she said a group of reporters identified themselves as press. The officers fired tear gas at the journalists ├втВм┼Уpoint-blank├втВм┬Э without responding to the reporters├втВмтДв pleas to tell them where they should go, she said. Minnesota State Patrol just fired tear gas at reporters and photographers at point blank range. Hennessy-Fiske said she was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet and posted a photo of her injury on Twitter: That├втВмтДвs the PG version of my leg courtesy of @MnDPS_MSP still going to report tonight and tomorrow A photographer and activist was also struck in the left eye with what she believed was a rubber bullet and said she has been permanently blinded in that eye: Hey folks, took a tracer found to the face (I think, given my backpack) and am headed into surgery to see if we can save my left eye Am wisely not gonna be on Twitter while I├втВмтДвm on morphine Stay safe folks Several other reporters have also said they have been pepper-sprayed or arrested: I was pepper-sprayed then arrested last night by Minneapolis PD even after identifying myself as a reporter MULTIPLE times: Cop 1: *checks press badge as I├втВмтДвm on the ground* Cop 2: ├втВм┼УRoll on your side, Mr. journalist.├втВм┬Э Cop 3: *loads me in the car, sees my press badge and shrugs* ""I'M NOT FIGHTING"": Tom Aviles, an award-winning photographer with CBS Minnesota, was arrested and struck by a rubber bullet while covering protests in Minneapolis. https://t.co/uIJsKYOboi MSNBC reporters were just almost hit with some sort of explosive device by law enforcement officers in Minneapolis Minneapolis police march on a parking lot where VICE reporter @MichaelAdams317 is sheltering.

Tim Walz apologized for the second time about the ongoing arrests. ├втВм┼УIt is unacceptable,├втВм┬Э he said, adding he recognized the role journalists have to play in the protests. ├втВм┼УI take full responsibility for that and won't equivocate no matter how difficult the environment is.├втВм┬Э Denver NEW: Photographer Hyoung Chang was covering a George Floyd protest Thursday night in downtown Denver when police began firing cannisters of tear gas and balls loaded with pepper at the crowds. An officer fired two pepper balls directly at him, Chang said. https://t.co/PcWDZnQeBW In Denver, staff photographer Hyoung Chang for the Denver Post said police fired canisters of tear gas at the crowd and also fired pepper balls directly at him. Louisville, Kentucky In Louisville, Kentucky, police were captured on camera shooting what appear to be pepper balls at a local TV camera crew. ""I was wearing a vest with 'Press' in reflective lettering, and I was shot several times in the chest, legs, and my right arm,"" journalist James Dobson wrote on Saturday. A WAVE 3 News reporter was also struck while on air. Los Angeles In Los Angeles, police shot rubber bullets at a radio journalist and shattered the rear window of another├втВмтДвs car: LAPD just shot me and protestors gathered at Beverly &amp; Fairfax with rubber bullets.

3759,Police Officers Are Joining Protests Against Police Brutality In Some Cities,"Officers in some cities have decided to welcome the protesters instead of instigating them. According to Forbes, in Camden, New Jersey, and other cities, police have engaged with protesters peacefully and showed gestures of respect. In Camden, NJ, protestors took to the streets to peacefully protest racial injustice. When police saw them marching, they did something. They decided to join them. #riots2020 #GeorgeFloyd #laprotest #LosAngelesriots #GeorgeFloydProtests pic.twitter.com/84eagEYFv5 ├втВмтАЭ Beth Doane (@BethDoane) May 31, 2020  In Camden, police marched with a banner reading ├втВм┼УStanding in Solidarity,├втВм┬Э and seemed to join in with the crowd chanting ├втВм┼Уno justice, no peace.├втВм┬Э In other jurisdictions, officers joined protesters, or ├втВм┼Уtook a knee├втВм┬Э outside of their departments in a symbolic act of solidarity. https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1266926177878519809 Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson was seen telling protesters in Flint, Michigan that he wanted the day├втВмтДвs demonstrations to be more like a parade than a protest.

Regardless of the intent, this seems to be a much smarter strategy than shooting the streets up with teargas. Chattanooga Chief of Police David Roddy made a post on Twitter saying that police officers who don├втВмтДвt have an issue with what happened to George Floyd should turn in their badges. There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how ├втВм┼Уit plays out├втВм┬Э. There is no need to put a knee on someone├втВмтДвs neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don├втВмтДвt have an issue with this├втВм┬жturn it in. pic.twitter.com/frNCAWCeq6 ├втВмтАЭ David Roddy (@ChiefDavidRoddy) May 27, 2020  The protests that have spread around the country in recent weeks are in response to the police killing of George Floyd. The Minneapolis police arrested officer Derek Chavin in hopes to quell the protests, but the demonstrations have continued and expanded throughout the country. Chauvin is the recently fired officer who was seen in the now-viral video in which Floyd was killed. Chauvin kneeled on Floyd├втВмтДвs neck for several minutes as he gasped for air and begged for his life. He has been with the Minneapolis Police Department for 19 years, and in that time, he has been involved in multiple shootings in which people were killed, and has had multiple excessive force complaints during his career. The case has become so controversial because of the blatant use of force shown in the footage, but also because the evidence shows that Floyd was entirely complaint and peaceful throughout the arrest, and that there was no reason to be so forceful with him. The incident is such a flashpoint across the country because it has become a symbol of the experiences that so many other people in the country have with police. Police initially said Floyd was resisting arrest and had a medical incident. However, surveillance video obtained by CBS News showed Floyd cooperating with the officers, and video of his death clearly shows that he was not resisting. The videos to initially surface of the incident showed the moments where officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the ground with his knee on Floyd├втВмтДвs neck. In those videos, Floyd was not fighting or struggling with the officers at all, but police claimed that he was resisting after he was first taken out of his car. Now, surveillance camera footage that was released from a nearby restaurant shows Floyd being removed from his car by police without resisting. The new video shows him being taken from the car and placed in handcuffs, which means that he had no opportunity to resist.",1,3,1,3
3776,Anti-Lockdown Protests Originated With Tight-Knit Group Who Share Bigger Goal: Trump 2020 | Snopes.com,"Organizers of ├втВм┼УOperation Gridlock,├втВм┬Э the first significant protest against the lockdown measures issued by state governments in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, urged participants to remain in their vehicles as they halted traffic around the Capitol Building in Lansing, Michigan, on April 15, 2020. Two weeks later, alongside many of the same people who promoted those actions, protesters not only left their cars but entered that building, flanked by armed militias demanding that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer open the government and allow residents the freedom to return to work. Competing narratives have emerged surrounding this anti-lockdown movement, which has spread across the country and increasingly come to embrace anti-government conspiracy theories, dangerous pseudoscience, and occasional threats or acts of violence. To its supporters, the movement represents a grassroots expression of patriotic discontent over unconstitutional measures that infringe on liberty and cause economic hardship. To its detractors, the movement inflates perceived opposition to life-saving public health measures with help from dark money tied to the family of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Several media reports have previously linked Operation Gridlock to the influential DeVos family through an organization tangentially funded by them, which purchased $250 in Facebook advertisements to promote the April 15 event. While this connection is largely factual, it is quantitatively negligible and, more importantly, misses the bigger picture. By combining a sometimes second-by-second chronology of which users shared Facebook invites to the protests with hundreds of pages of campaign-finance records and local news reports, Snopes demonstrates that this anti-lockdown movement was originally pushed by a small circle of fervent activists who have been protesting almost constantly since well before the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, they have benefited from a political action infrastructure originally created to support the DeVos-funded, anti-union ├втВм┼Уright-to-work├втВм┬Э movement. These methods have apparently created the perception of widespread discontent with public health measures largely supported by the American populace and are part of a campaign playbook self-evidently resulting in an increasingly radicalized base of Trump supporters as the 2020 general election approaches. Betsy DeVos├втВмтДв family ├втВмтАЭ whose wealth stems from father-in-law Richard DeVos├втВмтДв success in creating and running the multi-level marketing company Amway ├втВмтАЭ has financed libertarian political causes with an influence comparable to the Koch brothers├втВмтДв for decades. The children of Richard DeVos, Sr. and their families, through at least five separate foundations, generally provide much of this financial support in a coordinated way as a family unit. To get a sense of the scale of their political involvement, note that in 2015 and 2016 the DeVos family made $14 million in political contributions, including substantial funding to the Michigan state Republican Party and other county-level GOP chapters. The link between the DeVoses and the Operation Gridlock event stems from the former├втВмтДвs support of an independent PAC, the Michigan Freedom Network, which received a combined $250,000 from five members of the Devos family on March 18, 2020. The Michigan Freedom Network owns and operates the website of the Michigan Freedom Fund, a political non-profit. The Michigan Freedom Network shares staff, finances, and other resources with both the Freedom Fund and with the DeVos-funded Great Lakes Education Project, which is an ├втВм┼Уadvocacy organization supporting quality choices in public education.├втВм┬Э The Michigan Freedom Fund, whose executive director is lobbyist Tony Daunt, was a co-host of the first Operation Gridlock event on Facebook. By email, Daunt told us the fund spent only $250 on Facebook ads to promote the protest. DeVos family spokesman Nick Wasmiller told us by email that the purpose of the DeVos family donations to the Michigan Freedom Network, which occurred in the same amount in 2016 and 2018, has always been to support candidates for state-level office, and that the money has always been earmarked for that and no other purpose: ├втВм┼УLike the Michigan Freedom Network, the DeVos family advocates for policies that support a fair and open economy, accountable government, strong individual rights and opportunity for all. These shared principles have inspired DeVos family members ├втВмтАЬ like many other Michigan residents ├втВмтАЬ to periodically make contributions to MFN with the latest coming earlier this year. These contributions are restricted to support of state house candidates who are seeking office in the coming election cycle.├втВм┬Э Since 2015, the Michigan Freedom Network has participated in at least 60 different state-level campaigns, but the assertion that the DeVos money does not go toward the fund ├втВмтАЭ which received $51,032 from the Network between 2015 and 2018 ├втВмтАЭ is unverifiable. In terms of direct financial support for this protest, however, the most one could reasonably argue might have come from the DeVoses via the Network would be $250 for Facebook ads. The Freedom Fund itself has minimized its connection to the Operation Gridlock protest as well. ├втВм┼УThe April 15 Operation Gridlock protest in Lansing was organized by a different organization ├втВмтАЭ one unaffiliated with the Michigan Freedom Fund ├втВмтАЭ called the Michigan Conservative Coalition,├втВм┬Э Daunt told us. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is a collection of former Tea Party-aligned groups and pro-Trump organizations whose purpose is to recruit and train an ├втВм┼Уarmy of conservative activists,├втВм┬Э most notably the groups Michigan Trump Republicans, Women for Trump, and the Lakes Area TEA Party. The people who run the coalition have deep ties to the Michigan GOP and to Trump campaign surrogates, and the coalition was founded by Meshawn Maddock and Marian Sheridan. Maddock is the wife of Republican state Rep. Matt Maddock and serves on the national advisory board for the group Woman for Trump. Sheridan is grassroots vice chair of the Michigan Republican Party and was a founding member of the Lakes Area TEA Party. Another Coalition leader, Rosanne Ponkowski, has served as co-chair of the Oakland County (Michigan) Republican Party. The separation between the Michigan Freedom Fund and the Michigan Conservative Coalition is not as clear as Daunt has claimed. Individuals from both organizations frequently collaborate on shared goals. Members of both organizations, for example, have been deeply invested in getting conservative members on the Michigan redistricting commission, which was created to limit political gamesmanship in the process of drawing new congressional districts in that state. Daunt, of the Michigan Freedom Fund, and Sheridan, of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, were both involved in a (failed) legal challenge against the Michigan secretary of state that criticized rules barring several individuals linked to the Michigan Conservative Coalition from serving on that redistricting commission. Eric Doster, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, is the husband of Mary Doster, who is the treasurer of the Michigan Freedom Network. To test the theory that grassroots leaders connected to or trained by these organizations were responsible for the bulk of the early promotion of the Michigan anti-lockdown protests on Facebook that helped launch a nationwide movement, we created a database of all of the people and Facebook pages who shared invites to early Michigan lockdown protests. This research revealed a tightly knit community of political activists that has been protesting since well before the COVID-19 pandemic. This activist cohort uses a political action infrastructure linked to the 2012-era, anti-union right-to-work movement in Michigan, which occurred principally due to massive political spending by the DeVoses. We used the analytics tool Crowdtangle to collect a database of information on nearly 1,000 separate instances in which a Facebook account shared a lockdown-protest event page to a Facebook group in April 2020. We collected information from 39 different lockdown events across the country identified by key search terms, Facebook-recommended related events, and a list of protests advertised on the website of the libertarian-aligned group FreedomWorks (which has previously been supported by the DeVos family). The resulting report here concerns only data derived from Michigan, but the entire raw dataset, which includes other states, can be viewed here. The information produced by this process aligns with previously reported aspects of the lockdown protest├втВмтДвs suspicious social media behavior. For example, the largest and most frequently used groups to spread these events were ones created by the Dorr brothers, four pro-gun activists. They created several anti-quarantine groups and associated websites ├втВмтАЭ including Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine ├втВмтАЭ days before Operation Gridlock, which attracted hundreds of thousands of people, as reported by the Washington Post and NBC News. What our dataset adds to this discussion is an intricate chronology of the Michigan lockdown movement├втВмтДвs promotion on Facebook, allowing for the identification of a small group of activists who first pushed the protests├втВмтДв online promotion and who subsequently received a disproportionate amount of media coverage. Our first step was to sort all instances of people sharing protest event pages chronologically. Doing so allowed us to view ├втВм┼Уbursts├втВм┬Э of shares ├втВмтАЭ times when a Facebook user either copy-and-pasted several invites to multiple groups manually, or times when, some of these Facebook users later told us, they used a recently allowed method for automatically posting to multiple Facebook groups at once. Joan Donovan, an online extremism expert and the research director of Harvard├втВмтДвs Shorenstein Center, told us that Facebook groups have been the backbone of protest movements going back to the Occupy Wall Street movement of the 2010├втВмтДвs, and that this multiple-post feature can be a powerful messaging tool for activists. ├втВм┼УIt works really well in memetic warfare campaigns because you can post the same meme to a bunch of different groups,├втВм┬Э she told us in a phone interview. We term these multi-posters ├втВм┼Уboosters,├втВм┬Э which we defined as an account that shared the same event to at least four groups separated by no more than 60 seconds. In our dataset, these instances are highlighted in yellow. The first two boosters who met this criterion were Rob Cortis and Cindi Holland. Via Facebook messenger and email, we reached out to Holland, who asked us to send questions by email but provided no response to our questions when we did. Via his website, we reached out to Cortis, who told us by email to contact him by phone but provided us with an incorrect number. A follow-up email with a list of questions had not been responded to as of this writing. Cortis is a well-known figure in Trump circles. One could argue he is equal parts activist and self-contained traveling side show, who since October 2016 has toured the country with a parade-style float dubbed the ├втВм┼УTrump Unity Bridge.├втВм┬Э A literal bridge on a trailer, this float is adorned with various Trump slogans and American flag iconography. Cortis and the bridge have become a fixture of Trump rallies and protests. Though he mostly supports his unity tour through donations, at least one political campaign has paid him. In 2017 and 2018, Cortis received $6,398.20 from the (unsuccessful) gubernatorial campaign of former Michigan state Sen. Pat Colbeck as reimbursement for ├втВм┼Уrental equipment.├втВм┬Э  Holland, the second person in our database to promote Operation Gridlock to multiple groups, is the campaign director for a current political campaign, Mike Detmer for Congress. Detmer organized one of the caravans that traveled to Lansing for Operation Gridlock. This fact was noted in several publications because he briefly went viral for appearing in a photograph with a very non-social-distanced group of people that included a member of the Proud Boys flashing a ├втВм┼Уwhite power├втВм┬Э symbol during the caravan meet-up. As of this writing, his campaign has received endorsements from two individuals: former Milwaukee County sheriff and current Trump surrogate David Clarke, and the aforementioned Cortis benefactor Colbeck. Another frequent booster of several Michigan lockdown protests was Londa Gatt, who serves as the grassroots director for the Detmer campaign and also as Midwest regional director for the pro-Trump organization Bikers for Trump, a massive organization with actual influence in the Trump administration. We asked Gatt about her Facebook promotion of the lockdown protests via Facebook messenger, and she responded with a voice recording asking us ├втВм┼УWho are you really?├втВм┬Э As part of her work on the Detmer campaign, and also in several instances that predate it, Gatt has frequently appeared at media spectacles that included Cortis and his Trump Unity Bridge. In 2017, for example, Gatt organized a Bikers for Trump event, which Cortis attended, that was meant to provide a ├втВм┼Уbarrier wall├втВм┬Э of protection between Kid Rock and a group of anti-Trump protesters at one of his shows.  Our database of boosters included other Cortis collaborators as well. In an event held a week after Operation Gridlock, Cortis and the Trump Unity Bridge were the featured attraction at a second lockdown-related protest outside of Gov. Whitmer├втВмтДвs house. This event, which protesters dubbed ├втВм┼УOperation Queens Castle,├втВм┬Э made national news despite its meager turnout. The event was pushed to several Facebook groups at the same time by Brandon Hall, who was also listed as the event├втВмтДвs host on Facebook. Hall is a self-described ├втВм┼Уlifelong political nerd,├втВм┬Э a former Michigan Trump Campaign volunteer, and a felon somewhat infamously convicted of election fraud in 2014. ├втВм┼УGretchen Whitmer is tyranny, this is like a third world country. It├втВмтДвs like V for Vendetta and Idiocracy hooked up and they produced this baby that is 2020,├втВм┬Э Hall told local news outlet Up North Live from outside Whitmer├втВмтДвs home.  Hall pushed the Queen├втВмтДвs Castle event to many of the same groups used by Cortis and Holland, including Auto Workers for Trump 2020. Brian Pannebecker, who was described in a September 2017 report as ├втВм┼Уa go-to source for reporters seeking comment from Trump backers in Michigan,├втВм┬Э runs the Auto Workers Facebook group. Indeed, Pannebecker has been quoted as the voice of Michigan Trump supporters on a host of issues in a wide range of venues, including CNN and the Wall Street Journal, and has himself penned several opinion pieces lauding Trump published by his local newspaper. He has also attended multiple events with both Cortis and Hall.  Some combination of these above individuals, all of whom were involved in the promotion of the lockdown protests on Facebook, are disproportionately represented in past media accounts regarding pro-Trump demonstrations in Michigan. In September 2019, for example, Pannepacker, Cortis, and Gatt were each quoted or discussed in the Macomb Daily├втВмтДвs coverage of a ├втВм┼Уflash mob├втВм┬Э meant to ├втВм┼Уcounteract illegitimate attacks on the president.├втВм┬Э Explaining her reason for attending this flash mob, participant Darlene Doetzel asserted to that newspaper that ├втВм┼Уfake news is out there every day, seven days a week telling lies.├втВм┬Э Doetzel, it bears mentioning, is also one of the boosters identified in our database. She did not respond to requests for comment we sent by Facebook messenger and email. These observations do not demonstrate some elaborate and centralized pro-Trump conspiracy. Instead, they are notable because they suggest that the major impetus, when it comes to the people who promoted the lockdown events on Facebook and had their voices amplified in national or international media reports, was not so much the specific public-health measures meant to counter COVID-19. Rather, it was support of Trump in general. Their dedication to the anti-lockdown cause specifically is somewhat undermined by their history of supporting several attention-grabbing, pro-Trump causes dating back to 2016. In other words, they would likely still be holding protests and demonstrations in a non-pandemic reality. Furthermore, these observations make clear that a supposedly massive grassroots movement was ├втВмтАЭ at least at its conception ├втВмтАЭ principally the result of a much smaller number of activists who know how to create a media spectacle. ├втВм┼УIf Betsy DeVos is reading this,├втВм┬Э Hall wrote to us on Facebook messenger when we asked about financial support for his activism, ├втВм┼УGirl, I have NOT gotten the check the Twitter people and other radical liberals are saying I received.├втВм┬Э Every protest organizer or promoter we contacted similarly denied receiving funds from anyone for their activism, and in most cases this is consistent with the evidence available to us via public records and campaign disclosures. Attempting to tie the DeVoses to these protesters or the movement they represent through the Michigan Freedom Fund├втВмтДвs $250 Facebook ad buy misses the substantial role played by the political action machine the DeVoses birthed in the early 2010s, which turned Michigan into a right-to-work state. The passage of right-to-work legislation in Michigan, an anti-union cause banning mandatory union dues as a condition of employment, was a major political coup. It almost certainly wouldn├втВмтДвt have occurred, according to many of the politicians involved, without the significant financial and political pressure applied by the DeVoses and the political action network they created to promote it. Following a 2009 victory that defeated a pro-union bill in the Michigan legislature, Dick DeVos, Jr. (husband of Betsy DeVos) and Ron Weiser, a former Michigan GOP chair, U.S. ambassador and ├втВм┼Уpolitical guru,├втВм┬Э began to strategize a path toward passing full right-to-work legislation. This path included recruiting from and fostering the grassroots activism of the Tea Party movement, financing candidates in local elections while promising support to candidates who faced tough reelection battles for their support of right-to-work, research on messaging, and lots of ad buys. The Michigan Freedom Fund ├втВмтАЭ the same one that bought $250 worth of ads for Operation Gridlock ├втВмтАЭ was explicitly founded to fund one of those ad buys.  Many of the activists we connected to the Facebook promotion of the early Michigan lockdown protests were also activists associated with the DeVos-Weiser push to get right-to-work legislation passed in Michigan. Pannebecker, of the group Autoworkers for Trump 2020, for example, has repeatedly referred to himself in media reports as a ├втВм┼Уspokesperson for Michigan Freedom to Work.├втВм┬Э He has attended at least one Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference ├втВмтАЭ an event historically financed in large part by organizations connected to or funded by the DeVoses ├втВмтАЭ where he was photographed with DeVos associate Weiser. We asked Pannebecker on Facebook messenger if any connection existed between the freedom-to-work movement and his auto workers Facebook group and its use in promoting anti-lockdown measures, or if he has been paid by or supported by outside money. He simply replied ├втВм┼Уno.├втВм┬Э While many of the people we identified as pushing these protests to multiple Facebook groups used Pannebecker├втВмтДвs Auto Workers for Trump 2020 group, several boosters ├втВмтАЭ Cortis, Doetzel, and Hall ├втВмтАЭ all used the Facebook group Lakes Area TEA Party for that purpose as well. While the Lakes Area TEA Party as an organization was founded by current Michigan Conservative Coalition leaders, the Facebook group was created in 2013 by Tim Bos, who rose to prominence as a former union worker who became ├втВм┼Уa vocal proponent├втВм┬Э of the right-to-work movement. His Facebook profile states that he attended the Leadership Institute, described by the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets as ├втВм┼Уa decades-old nonprofit that provides training for conservative activists.├втВм┬Э It receives significant funding from the conservative dark-money group DonorsTrust, which itself receives significant funding from the DeVos family. Bos did not respond to our request for comment. Former Michigan State Sen. Colbeck, whose campaign for governor paid funds to Trump Unity Bridge owner Cortis, is intimately linked to the DeVos political machine via right-to-work legislation. According to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, his rise as a Tea Party politician was heavily funded by DeVos money, and when he held elected office he advocated fiercely for their policies. As senator, he was one of the co-sponsors of the successfully passed Michigan right-to-work legislation. Colbeck, often as part of the Mike Detmer for Congress campaign, is a frequent speaker at pro-Trump events. He and Detmer were also all in attendance at Operation Gridlock and the later protest, the American Patriot Rally, that received widespread coverage due to the armed militias in the Michigan Capitol. Finally, as previously mentioned, Detmer├втВмтДвs campaign for Congress is currently run by Facebook booster Holland. Holland, who has appeared at several events with both Colbeck and Cortis and has worked closely alongside protest booster Gatt, is on the board of the Michigan Conservative Union. This organization appears to share a phone number, email address, and contact person with the group Michigan Freedom to Work ├втВмтАЭ the same organization that Pannebecker has stated in past media reports to have been a spokesperson for. Again, this does not suggest a massive, centralized conspiracy orchestrated by the DeVos family to activate a past network of right-to-work activists to oppose restrictions on COVID-19 public health measures. What these connections instead show is that a small group of zealous activists identified by our database do not credibly represent the voice of grassroots citizens untouched by political influence. These individuals (as evidenced by their past activism) and the infrastructure they control (as evidenced by its creation for another political purpose) mobilized not for their objection to lockdowns specifically. Instead, the primary effect of their efforts by design seems to be energizing Trump├втВмтДвs base in an election year.   On June 11, 2019, a local Republican organization, the Michigan 10th Congressional District GOP, hosted its annual Ronald Reagan Dinner ├втВмтАЭ a fundraiser headlined that year by National GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale. None of the attendees could have possibly known that a pandemic would be declared nine months later, necessitating a global wave of stay-at-home orders that would grind the global economy to a halt and fundamentally transform daily life in America and across the world. Yet virtually everyone identified in our dataset as boosting the anti-lockdown protests on Facebook, or associated with the Michigan Conservative Coalition, was in attendance at that dinner. Present were flash-mob attendee and protest booster Doetzel, Detmer campaign director protest booster Holland, Operation Queen├втВмтДвs Castle organizer and protest booster Hall, Trump Unity Bridge driver and protest booster Cortis, and Autoworkers for Trump├втВмтДвs Pannebecker. The Michigan Conservative Coalition├втВмтДвs Maddock, Sheridan, and Ponkowski were all there as well. So was Matt Seely, the current president of the Michigan Conservative Coalition. In his keynote address, Parscale accused Democrats of a litany of offenses related to immigration, healthcare, and environmental policy, telling the roused audience that, ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs patriots like you who are going to stop them.├втВм┬Э At the Michigan lockdown protest dubbed the ├втВм┼УAmerican Patriot Rally├втВм┬Э less than a year later ├втВмтАЭ attended by many who were in the audience of the Ronald Reagan Dinner ├втВмтАЭ an armed militia entered the Michigan Capitol Building demanding the revocation of laws that health officials and epidemiologists say remain necessary to prevent further catastrophe. Another group organized an event that day alongside the Michigan Conservative Coalition├втВмтДвs efforts, and this second group may have been the one responsible for the armed protesters. But for many of the activists ├втВмтАЭ armed or not ├втВмтАЭ among the crowds gathered at the Patriot Rally, Operation Queen├втВмтДвs Castle or Operation Gridlock, these demonstrations were evidently a single battle in a years-long war whose previous fronts have included flash mobs, billboard-painting parties, anti-impeachment rallies, and Kid Rock concerts. To be sure, hundreds of people attended both Operation Gridlock and the American Patriot Rally. Many likely had no connection to previous activism and were motivated to attend out of a genuine frustration at the stay-at-home measures and a fear of economic uncertainty. Anti-lockdown sentiment has been ├втВм┼Уgenerated by people who are really angry and scared [and who] really see their governors and mayors as the problem behind this,├втВм┬Э Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and co-author of the book ├втВм┼УThe Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,├втВм┬Э told us in a phone interview. On the other hand, as we have demonstrated in this investigation, the spark that ignited the movement owes itself in no small part to a small coterie of activists whose messaging appears to have been honed ├втВмтАЭ at least in in some cases ├втВмтАЭ in conservative activist training programs, and whose use of a political action machine exists thanks to millions of dollars of funding from a handful of billionaires. This ├втВм┼Уmixture of grassroots and top-down organizing├втВм┬Э is what made the Tea Party movement of the early 2010s such a success, Williamson told us. ├втВм┼УI am worried about that,├втВм┬Э she added, ├втВм┼Уespecially for the upcoming election, because if this movement basically generates more enthusiasm, they could become a force politically well beyond this one particular issue.├втВм┬Э Whether the anti-lockdown movement will become a force to be reckoned with is unclear. Polls suggest a majority of Americans support the lockdown measures and oppose the lockdown protests, even when only people who have lost their jobs and are suffering economic hardship are polled. What is clear, though, is that the movement has already expanded well beyond one particular issue, and those issues are becoming dangerously divorced from reality. The Michigan Conservative Coalition├втВмтДвs website, at the time of this reporting, showcases the objectively false anti-vaccine conspiracy video ├втВм┼УPlandemic.├втВм┬Э The Facebook groups dedicated to the anti-lockdown cause are a fever swamp of conspiracy theories ranging from Bill Gates├втВмтДв desire to track the global population through microchips in COVID-19 vaccines to the notion that a cohort of patriots under the leadership of someone referred to as ├втВм┼УQ├втВм┬Э will overthrow the ├втВм┼Уdeep state.├втВм┬Э A $250 Facebook ad buy from the DeVos-linked Michigan Freedom Fund did not create this coalition, nor did it single-handedly launch the anti-lockdown movement. The well-connected political action machine that originally created the Michigan Freedom Fund, however, has been objectively successful in presenting the fringe views of that movement as having widespread grassroots support in national media coverage. This increasingly radicalized base, and the tactics that gave rise to Operation Gridlock, will no doubt become a potent messaging tool as the 2020 general election approaches. Reporters seeking the views of Midwest conservatives will need to be aware, among many other things, that Trump supporters other than Pannebecker and Cortis exist in Michigan.

3963,"Trump Salutes Protest Where ""Hang Fauci"" Sign Was Displayed","Menu  SALT LAKE CITY ├втВмтАЭ A protest against police brutality in downtown Salt Lake City Saturday has escalated, leading to response from SWAT teams and the National Guard. The demonstration was one of multiple protests planned in response to the death of George Floyd, who died Monday in police custody after video showed a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe and went unconscious. Organizers also say they are demonstrating for 22-year-old Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City Police one week ago. The department is expected to release body camera footage within 10 days of the incident. The protest was intended by organizers to be peaceful, but it gradually escalated as the Salt Lake City Police Department headquarters building was vandalized with spray-painted messages, and an unoccupied SLCPD vehicle has been overturned, smashed and set on fire at 200 East and 400 South. A Utah Transit Authority TRAX station was also damaged. Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement on the incident: ├втВм┼УWe are in close contact with our department of public safety and receiving regular updates. Our hearts break for the family of George Floyd. We are grateful for the swift actions taken by the state of Minnesota to hold those responsible for his death accountable. We can not, however, condone violence, defacement of public buildings, and destruction of property. We call upon the good people of Utah to engage civilly and to act peaceably as they seek to exercise their first amendment rights.├втВм┬Э He later announced he will be calling in the National Guard.Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, news media, people traveling directly to and from work, traveling directly to and from the Airport, seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or those experiencing homelessness. Police have asked the public to avoid the Salt Lake metro area if possible. Many of the demonstrators have marched to the State Capitol, where Utah Highway Patrol are keeping anyone from going up the stairs leading to the building. SLCPD SWAT teams have now responded downtown along with agencies from surrounding areas. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has announced a curfew at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday morning for the entire city. Mendenhall and SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said no one is allowed to be in public during that time even for traveling, but provided the following exceptions: Mendenhall and Brown held a press conference at 9 p.m. with an update on the curfew, asking the public to stay home and for protesters to go home. Brown also stated that six people had been arrested at the time. One officer was hit over the head with a baseball bat and is recovering in the hospital. Brown said if he had not been wearing a helmet, he would have likely been seriously injured or killed. About Us",1,3,0,0

Mr. Trump has stepped up to the fight and announced that the U.S. is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization over its handling of China├втВмтДвs role in the coronavirus crisis. He also imposed fresh sanctions on Beijing and Hong Kong officials for their security crackdown on the financial hub. The president disclosed over the weekend that he is working to add India, South Korea, Russia and Australia to the Group of Seven nations├втВмтДв annual summit. Aides said the move is partly aimed at confronting China├втВмтДвs rising influence.

The column, written by Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, took aim at the Trump administration for threatening to impose sanctions on China over its new security law in Hong Kong. The newspaper also took aim at Mr. Pompeo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. It mocked a statement Mrs. Pelosi made nearly a year ago that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were ├втВм┼Уa beautiful sight to behold├втВм┬Э at the time. ├втВм┼УNow, the ├втВм╦Ьbeautiful sight├втВмтДв is extending from Hong Kong to over a dozen U.S. states,├втВм┬Э the paper said. ├втВм┼УU.S. politicians now can enjoy this sight from their own windows.├втВм┬Э The demonstrations and, in many cases violent rioting, began last week in Minneapolis, where George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer handcuffed him and knelt directly on his neck for nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. ├втВм┼УA quick question for Pelosi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: Should the Chinese government and National People├втВмтДвs Congress issue a statement to support the protests by African-Americans and the grassroots of U.S. society?├втВм┬Э Mr. Hu wrote. ├втВм┼УIt seems to be what Beijing should do according to the logic of Washington cheering for the rioters in Hong Kong.├втВм┬Э Mr. Pompeo implicitly criticized the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs a different Chinese Communist Party today than it was 10 years ago,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УThis is a Chinese Communist Party that has come to view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideals, Western democracies, Western values, and puts Americans at risk,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УThe list is long, whether it├втВмтДвs stealing American intellectual property, destroying hundreds and millions of jobs here in the United States, further efforts to put at risk sea lanes in the South China Sea, denying commercial traffic.├втВм┬Э White House National Security Adviser Robert O├втВмтДвBrien said the president├втВмтДвs decision to pull the U.S. out of WHO was designed to force the international organization to end its ├втВм┼Уreliance on China.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre going to beat this COVID disease that was unleashed on us and came from China,├втВм┬Э Mr. O├втВмтДвBrien said on CNN├втВмтДвs ├втВм┼УState of the Union.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УBut in the meantime, we├втВмтДвre going to take that $440 million that the U.S. spends, compared to the $40 million that the Chinese spend on the WHO, and we├втВмтДвre going to make sure it gets to front-line health care workers.├втВм┬Э Mr. Trump announced Friday that the U.S. was terminating its relationship with WHO over its handling of the coronarvirus crisis and took actions to punish China for misleading the world on the virus and for its security crackdown on Hong Kong. The president also announced he was ending U.S. preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong. He said Hong Kong is no longer a separate territory because Beijing moved to curb its autonomy. ├втВм┼УChinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world,├втВм┬Э Mr. Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden. ├втВм┼УThe Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside.├втВм┬Э Deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 rose to nearly 104,000 on Sunday. Business shutdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus have thrown roughly 40 million Americans out of work in less than three months. The president said the sudden hardship wrought by the virus was one reason he insisted on attending the first manned space launch in the U.S. in nine years on Saturday in Florida. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs such a great inspiration for our country,├втВм┬Э Mr. Trump said of the Space X launch. ├втВм┼УWe think next year is going to be one of the best years we├втВмтДвve ever had, economically. We suffered something that was terrible. It should have never happened. It should have never come out of China, but it did. They didn├втВмтДвt stop it. They were unable, probably, to stop it.├втВм┬Э The president is imposing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials who are involved in restricting freedoms in Hong Kong. He also is moving to end Hong Kong├втВмтДвs preferential trading status with the U.S. ├втВм┼УHe├втВмтДвs asked us to review every preferential treatment that Hong Kong had and work to eliminate it. It no longer make sense,├втВм┬Э Mr. Pompeo said. The administration also is suspending the entry of ├втВм┼Уcertain foreign nationals from China├втВм┬Э as potential security risks. The president├втВмтДвs move will affect a small percentage of the approximately 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S., including graduate students and researchers with ties to the Chinese military. The president said Beijing├втВмтДвs crackdown on Hong Kong ├втВм┼Уis a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China and, indeed, the people of the world.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УChina claims it is protecting national security, but the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society,├втВм┬Э Mr. Trump said. ├втВм┼УBeijing├втВмтДвs decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of China├втВмтДвs invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty. China has replaced its promise formula of ├втВм╦Ьone country, two systems├втВмтДв with ├втВм╦Ьone country, one system.├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э Rep. Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican and a leading congressional critic of China├втВмтДвs human rights record, said past administrations answered China with ├втВм┼Уcheap rhetoric├втВм┬Э that emboldened its communist rulers. ├втВм┼УPresident Trump, however, is beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do,├втВм┬Э Mr. Smith said. ├втВм┼УFor the sake of oppressed people, the United States ├втВмтАЭ even if we have to go it alone ├втВмтАЭ must impose sanctions.├втВм┬Э The State Department outraged Chinese leaders last week by declaring that U.S. leaders officially assess that Hong Kong no longer has the legal and economic freedom that the Chinese government promised under its treaty with Britain that gave the former colony back to Beijing in 1997. Chinese media accused Mr. Trump of hypocrisy with his sanctions over Hong Kong├втВмтДвs protests. ├втВм┼УTrump really had the nerve to make the announcement when a group of furious Washington citizens were storming toward the White House,├втВм┬Э the Global Times column said Saturday. ├втВм┼УWashington must have failed to anticipate that retribution could come that fast. It should be thinking about it though.├втВм┬Э In classic pro-China propagandist fashion, the Global Times column characterized the U.S. demonstrations as equivalent to protests against Chinese communist authoritarianism that have been rocking Hong Kong in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets in the territory to push back against the Chinese communist government├втВмтДвs gradual moves to strip the global financial hub of freedoms and governmental autonomy. Citing the clashes in American cities, the Global Times claimed that it is ├втВм┼Уas if the radical rioters in Hong Kong somehow snuck into the U.S. and created a mess.├втВм┬Э The column suggested that the U.S. protests were a kind of punishment for Mr. Trump over his policy on Hong Kong and said the U.S. political system is ├втВм┼Уdeclining├втВм┬Э at an ├втВм┼Уaccelerating├втВм┬Э rate. It sought to cast the authoritarian communist government in Beijing as superior. ├втВм┼УThe odds of outbreaks of riots in the U.S. are much higher than they are in China,├втВм┬Э it claimed. ├втВм┼УHow could politicians in Washington possibly define the disturbances in other countries as ├втВм╦Ьbeautiful sights├втВмтДв publicly? It is stupid to do so simply because they want to attack China. Let├втВмтДвs wait and see which country will encounter more chaos.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┬в Tom Howell Jr. and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.  Copyright ├В┬й 2021 The Washington Times, LLC.

4038,Australian anti-vaxxers label Covid-19 a 'scam' and break distancing rules at anti-5G protests,"├В┬й First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Donald Trump praised protesters who harassed a journalist on Long Island this week at a rally where one man called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci. The president of the United States voiced his support on Saturday for a protest against New York state├втВмтДвs public health orders that was backed by an anti-government militia and anti-vaccine activists who called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation├втВмтДвs senior immunologist. The ├втВм┼УRe-Open NY├втВм┬Э rally on Thursday in Commack, New York was organized by a group of Trump supporters who call themselves the Setauket Patriots, but also endorsed by anti-vaccination activists and the Long Island branch of the Oath Keepers, a national organization of current and former law enforcement officers and military veterans who think they are defending the nation from a range of imaginary threats posed by the federal government. Amid a sea of American flags and Trump banners, several of the signs waved by the protesters referenced conspiracy theories promoted by radical anti-vaccine activists that demonize Fauci and the philanthropist Bill Gates. A protester at a rally in Commack, New York on Thursday displayed a sign calling for the execution of the nation├втВмтДвs leading immunologist and a billionaire philanthropist. Photo: News 12 Long Island In addition to placards calling for New York to open businesses, others displayed at the rally channeled conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists who believe that Bill Gates is somehow behind the crisis. ├втВм┼УJust Say NO to Bill Gates,├втВм┬Э read one sign. Another, with idiosyncratic punctuation, read: ├втВм┼УMy Son├втВмтДвs Are Not Lab Rats For Bill Gates Vaccine.├втВм┬Э The protest outside a shuttered department store was attended by just a few hundred people, but it drew national attention after a local news reporter, Kevin Vesey, posted video of himself being harassed by demonstrators. The level of anger directed at the media from these protestors was alarming. As always, I will tell a fair and unbiased story today. pic.twitter.com/5jCR0YY9VH The protesters echoed the president├втВмтДвs anti-media harangues by complaining to Vesey that his channel, News 12 Long Island, had ├втВм┼Уstopped airing the Trump briefings,├втВм┬Э and taunted him with the chant, ├втВм┼УFake news is not essential.├втВм┬Э One woman told the reporter, ├втВм┼УYou├втВмтДвre the virus.├втВм┬Э Another accused him of ├втВм┼Уdestroying Suffolk and Long Island├втВм┬Э through his reporting on the coronavirus crisis. Suffolk County, where the protest took place, has been among the worst hit in the United States, with 37,942 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,733 deaths as of Saturday. That means the suburban New York county of just under 1.5 million people has a mortality rate more than 4 times the national average. One of those cases was News 12├втВмтДвs Vesey, who tested positive last month and recently recovered from a relatively mild case of the illness. During a longer Facebook Live report from the demonstration, Vesey was menaced at close range by a man in a Trump hat and shirt who was not wearing a mask but said that he did not need to keep his distance because, ├втВм┼УI got hydroxychloroquine; I├втВмтДвll be fine, bro.├втВм┬Э The man held a sign that called on one side for New York├втВмтДвs Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, to be deposed, and on the other accused his brother, Chris Cuomo, of lying about his bout with Covid-19. Another protester held up a sign saying Fauci ├втВм┼Уhas to go├втВм┬Э and falsely asserted that he ├втВм┼Уworks for├втВм┬Э for the World Health Organization. The television report Vesey filed on Thursday evening included video of one of the demonstrators displaying a sign for the camera that read: ├втВм┼УHang Fauci, Hang Gates, Open Up All Our States.├втВм┬Э I'll probably never forget what happened today.I was insulted. I was berated. I was practically chased by people who refused to wear masks in the middle of a pandemic.All the while, I was there to tell THEIR story. Here's the finished product. pic.twitter.com/HV2Hrcs7gi On Saturday morning, in a tweet that echoed his infamous praise for white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville in 2017, Trump described the protesters who had harassed the reporter as ├втВм┼УGreat people!├втВм┬Э James Robitsek, a leader of the pro-Trump Setauket Patriots group that organized the protest, confirmed in a Facebook message on Saturday that his call for opponents of the lockdown to rally had been supported by the local chapter of the anti-government Oath Keepers militia. ├втВм┼УThey copied my post and made up their own for their group,├втВм┬Э Robitsek said of the Oath Keepers. ├втВм┼УThey come to our events and vice versa. We all share events, our group is only 40-50 members.├втВм┬Э Thursday├втВмтДвs gathering, he said, included ├втВм┼Уmany people from other groups, or who just saw the post and wanted to come down.├втВм┬Э The Oath Keepers├втВмтДвs name is a reference to the belief of its members that they are bound by their pledge to ├втВм┼Уdefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,├втВм┬Э even if that means defying the government. As Justine Sharrock reported for Mother Jones in 2010, a year after the group was founded, some of the group├втВмтДвs first members were convinced then that it would not be long ├втВм┼Уbefore President Obama finds some pretext ├втВмтАЭ a pandemic, a natural disaster, a terror attack ├втВмтАЭ to impose martial law, ban interstate travel, and begin detaining citizens en masse.├втВм┬Э In an open letter posted online last month, the Long Island branch of the militia group echoed that belief, by declaring that the state├втВмтДвs orders to shut down businesses, churches and public gatherings were the acts of ├втВм┼Уan overbearing government acting under the guise of benevolence├втВм┬Э and had created ├втВм┼Уan untenable situation├втВм┬Э that justified resistance. ├втВм┼УAny government, or governing representative which acts in such a manner, attempts to act outside of the Constitution, and must be put on notice as doing such,├втВм┬Э the group wrote. The national group├втВмтДвs founder, Stewart Rhodes, a libertarian trial lawyer and former Ron Paul staffer, mocked Trump earlier this week for tweeting in support of protesters in Pennsylvania who want to re-open businesses. ├втВм┼УUh, they are using YOUR Admin├втВмтДвs guidelines, including the Orwellian ├втВм╦Ьessential/non-essential├втВмтДв paradigm, which is like something out of the USSR,├втВм┬Э Rhodes tweeted back at the president. On Twitter, Rhodes has also shared anti-vaccine conspiracy theories related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including one meme that described Gates as a ├втВм┼Уvaccine pushing globalist eugenicist├втВм┬Э and urged readers ├втВм┼Уto REFUSE to take ANY vaccine he funds, ├втВм╦Ьmandatory├втВмтДв or not.├втВм┬Э He also encouraged his followers to listen to a podcast in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attacked Gates and boosted a conspiracy theory about Fauci. The baseless smear on Fauci was first made by a discredited scientist who claims, without evidence, that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director buried her research about how vaccines can damage people├втВмтДвs immune systems. Those false claims about Fauci and Gates have been spread widely by the pro-Trump conspiracy group QAnon and by prominent anti-vaccine activists who have taken a leading role in recent protests demanding an end to the emergency public health orders in California, Texas and New York. Robitsek, the Setauket Patriots├втВмтДв leader, insisted that three of the people seen in Vesey├втВмтДвs video harassing the reporter were ├втВм┼Уnot associated with our group├втВм┬Э and suggested that at least one of them ├втВмтАЭ the man who had refused stay away from the reporter ├втВмтАЭ might have been ├втВм┼Уa plant by left leaning groups in the area who were against our rally coming to Commack.├втВм┬Э If so, the man has been under deep cover for some time, since a photograph on the Setauket Patriots Facebook page shows that he was also at a previous protest at the same spot two weeks ago. On that occasion, which was also covered by Vesey for News 12 Long Island, the man made no attempt to harass the reporter and did nothing to tarnish the reputation of the protesters. As for the woman who told Vesey he was the virus, Robitsek called her ├втВм┼Уa wacko,├втВм┬Э and noted that she travels to protests all across the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut provoking confrontations and filming them for her group├втВмтДвs Facebook page. Robitsek, who said that he has been unemployed for almost nine weeks and is yet to receive any payment from the state, cast the rally as a non-partisan attempt to push New York to let people earn a living. ├втВм┼УWe all need to work,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УGive me my unemployment, and I├втВмтДвll stay home then but I need to pay my bills and eat. People are getting desperate.├втВм┬Э Anxious to counter the negative publicity generated by Vesey├втВмтДвs video, Robitsek also suggested that a ├втВм┼Уlocal moms group├втВм┬Э that was opposed to the rally had been ├втВм┼Уin cahoots with the media before it even started.├втВм┬Э But the only evidence he could cite for that was a screenshot of a Facebook post from a member of the group Commack Parents Network, in which she had simply passed on an interview request from Vesey, saying that he would like one or more of them to explain why they were opposed to the re-opening protest taking place in their town. Robitsek also said that his group had agreed not to wave Trump flags, in a bid to be bipartisan, but many members of other groups who came to the rally did so. For his part, Robitsek wore what appeared to be one of Trump├втВмтДвs red caps, albeit a more understated one ├втВмтАЭ with ├втВм┼УUSA├втВм┬Э stitched on the front and ├втВм┼У45├втВм┬Э on the side ├втВмтАЭ and a mask, while carrying an American flag. In addition to his group and the Oath Keepers, Robitsek said, members of the Conservative Society for Action also attended the rally, as did, ├втВм┼Уa bunch of anti-vaccine people.├втВм┬Э Updated: Monday, May 18 1:12 a.m. PDTThis article was updated with a new headline. Robert Mackey[email protected]├втВмтА╣theintercept.com@RobertMackey The findings sparked a media sensation and led to a change in federal law. The insurance giant├втВмтДвs role was surprisingly common. Democracy Forward and the Union of Concerned Scientists say the Trump-era statement is biased, inaccurate, and runs afoul of federal law. The state├втВмтДвs fusion center, which coordinates police intelligence-sharing, enacted the policy after critical stories in the news media. ├В┬й First Look Institute. All rights reserved",1,3,0,0

4591,"Dallas man loses eye to ""non-lethal"" police round during George Floyd protest, attorneys say","May 31, 2020, 6:31 am* For the past several days and nights, protests have sprung up in numerous cities against police brutality and state violence against black men and women. They began in Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd was killed by Officer Derek Chauvin, who leaned on Floyd├втВмтДвs throat for eight minutes as he begged to be released, saying he could not breathe. The horrific scene was caught on tape and widely shared. As peaceful protesters were met with even more violence, including tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, tensions exploded. A police precinct was taken over and set on fire. Riots and looting took over many areas. Soon the city was put under a curfew, but it was too late to quell the rebellion. People all across the U.S. are fed up with the violence perpetrated by cops, especially racially motivated attacks against black citizens. Protests have sprung up in almost every state, in numerous cities. While most of these protests have started out as peaceful marches and gatherings, many have escalated as militarized police forces turn their weapons on the people, seemingly with impunity. Journalists have been arrested and targeted, even while cameras are running. There is a stark contrast of enforcement responses to anti-lockdown #protests where armed white civilians stormed gov├втВмтДвt buildings & others are on camera shoving police vs. nationwide #protests against police violence, where targeted arrests & use of force are deployed by police. https://t.co/rCcqBR9O7C ├втВмтАЭ Dreisen Heath (@dreisenheath) May 30, 2020  It├втВмтДвs unclear how things will end, but after months of lockdown and over 100,000 people dead of a virus the government has failed to contain, plus a looming depression, people are not going to be placated by platitudes anymore.

4621,"Even In Coronavirus Crisis, WHO Believes That Public Protests Are Important : Goats and Soda : NPR","The former president wrote about how to use this moment to make ""real change."" Communities come together in wake of George Floyd├втВмтДвs death Former President Barack Obama published a piece on Medium on Monday addressing the protests nationwide following the death of George Floyd -- and, specifically, how he thinks people can move forward to ""sustain momentum to bring about real change."" ""Ultimately, it├втВмтДвs going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe there are some basic lessons to draw from past efforts that are worth remembering."" His message overall stressed the importance of voting and participating in politics, particularly at the local level, where decisions on ground-level criminal justice and police practices are formed. The ""bottom line,"" he wrote, is that ""if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn├втВмтДвt between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."" The nation's first and only African American president began by acknowledging that ""the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States,"" noting that most people demonstrating have been ""peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring."" He also noted that ""police in cities like Camden and Flint have commendably understood"" that the protesters ""deserve our respect and support."" He also addressed the violence that has broken out at protests in several cities, although the exact root of that violence has been disputed, especially as it differs between locations. In his post, Obama requested people ""not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" From there, Obama addressed the importance of participating in politics and voting in every election, saying that ""the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels."" He said reform agendas will vary from place to place but should be tailored to each community and that it's up to organizers to educate themselves of what strategies work best. ""The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away,"" he wrote. Obama concluded his letter by acknowledging the pain in America, amid protests and a pandemic. ""I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting -- that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,"" he wrote. ""But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful."" He said the next moment in American history can be ""a real turning point"" if ""we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action."" The post also linked up to a toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, based on a task force on policing Obama formed while at White House, and also to resources at the Obama Foundation, he said, ""to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action."" Later Monday, Obama summarized the essay in a series of tweets, saying in part: ""Ultimately, it├втВмтДвs going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times."" This is the second time the former president has written something on the nation's unrest in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America,"" Obama wrote in a statement posted to Twitter Friday. ""It can't be 'normal.' If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has taken a different approach, facing some criticism for failing to address and unify the nation as protests grew over the weekend. Hours before Obama issued a statement Friday, Trump tweeted about the protests in Minneapolis, saying that ""thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd"" and, referencing the military, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet was flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence."" Trump on Sunday blamed ""ANTIFA"" for the protests turning violent and said he would label it as a terrorist organization, although his authority to deem a domestic group a terror organization remains unclear. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",1,3,1,3
4703,Undercover Investigation - Minneapolis Riot Was Preplanned,"Watch CBSN Live  Updated on: June 4, 2020 / 3:40 PM / CBS News Dallas ├втВмтАЭ Brandon Saenz was in a crowd protesting police brutality Saturday when he says he became a victim of it. ""All I heard was a boom. I got hit,"" Saenz said. ""I put my hands up, and I put my hand on my eye, and then I took off running,"" he said. The 26-year-old said he did nothing to provoke being shot with a non-lethal sponge round, but as a result, attorneys say, he lost his left eye, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. ""It is ironic that a protest about excessive use of force and police brutality ends with excessive use of force and police brutality,"" said Jesuorobo Enobakhare, who chairs the Dallas Police Oversight Board. Protesters have called for the Police Oversight Board to resume regular meetings that stopped during the coronavirus shutdowns. Next week it will. On its agenda will be votes on whether to investigate how the Dallas Police Department handles protests, as well as an incident that happened Monday night when hundreds of protesters walked onto the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. CBS DFW said it heard bangs and saw smoke, and saw a protester being carried away. ""She was flash-banged by police officers for walking peacefully,"" said the person helping her from the scene. Dallas Police Oversight monitor Tonya McClary, who reports to the board, said her office has seen a surge in complaints in the last two days. ""Our voicemail is almost full. We're still going through emails. What we've been able to get through right now is about 100,"" she said. Some cases, like Saenz's, have been fast-tracked and are already under investigation. McClary said some complaints against officers may be tossed out. Others could lead to discipline. The most serious cases could result in criminal investigations of officers involved. She said her office will independently review the department's decisions and, if it disagrees with any, can launch its own investigation. She and the board will also be able to look at the bigger picture and recommend any policy changes for the Dallas Police Department as a whole. The board is asking for photos, videos and first-hand accounts from the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge protest. First published on June 4, 2020 / 1:07 PM ├В┬й 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

4736,Buffalo police riot squad quit to back officers who shoved man,"Pien Huang Allison Aubrey In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization took time at its daily press conference to address another pressing issue: the wave of protests against police violence and racial injustice. The demonstrations began in the U.S. when George Floyd died on May 25 after a police officer had pressed a knee into his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds while detaining him in Minneapolis. The protests are now spreading around the world to Europe, Africa and other regions. ""WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on June 8. The demonstrations have prompted fear that the close contact of thousands of marchers could lead to a spike in case counts ├втВмтАЭ which hit a new high on Sunday, with 136,000 cases reported that day. Modelers say it's difficult to assess how the protests will influence COVID-19 infections. Because COVID-19 generally has an incubation time of up to two weeks, public health officials think it will take a couple of weeks before they see the impact. But it's clear that a key ingredient for transmission is present at many of these rallies: close contact. The images of protesters standing shoulder to shoulder ├втВмтАЭ some wearing face masks, others not ├втВмтАЭ raise concerns, especially in cities with higher rates of infection. To that end, Tedros recommends that protesters follow the guidance of local health officials and take precautions to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. ""We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely,"" he said, ""Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."" He also advised people to maintain a safe distance from others ├втВмтАЭ and to stay home if they are sick. ""The riskiest situation to be in is to be in close proximity to a case, particularly a symptomatic case, of COVID-19,"" said Michael Ryan, director of WHO's health emergencies program at the Monday press conference, so healthy people protesting next to one another may not meet the definition of coming in contact with the disease. However, it's become clear to researchers that the new coronavirus can be spread by people who aren't showing symptoms of it. ""Local public health official[s], on the basis of abundance of caution, could advise people either to quarantine or to get tested [after attending a mass gathering],"" Ryan said. Local officials have expressed similar worries about the interplay of the protests and the pandemic. Last week Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was concerned about what mass gatherings in the streets ""could mean for spikes in our coronavirus cases later."" She urged protesters to consider their exposure and consider being tested. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced free tests for demonstrators. Officials in Atlanta and New York have suggested testing as well. ""Testing everyone that participated in demonstrations would be useful in communities where many new cases are being reported every day. These new cases indicate that transmission is occurring at a high rate in the communities,"" said Bill Miller, an epidemiologist and physician at Ohio State University. He said an alternative to testing everyone would be active contact tracing. ""With new cases, the tracers could ask about demonstration participation, including days and times,"" Miller said. Then, if cases are linked to a demonstration, a call could go out to get everyone who participated in that event to be tested. Being outdoors seems to reduce the risk of exposure because the virus can't survive long in sunlight and there's better air circulation, but it's no guarantee against infection. Health experts warn that some activities linked with the protests ├втВмтАЭ such as riding public transportation to attend rallies or getting arrested and jailed indoors with others ├втВмтАЭ could increase a person's risk of getting exposed to the virus. Meanwhile, protests are expected to continue in the days ahead. George Floyd's burial service will take place on Tuesday at a private service in Houston.

4757,"Democrats Block Republican Police Reform Bill, Kill Hope Of Passing Legislation Amid Protests","HOME ACCESS GALLERY NEWS SHOP CONTACT More We have sources imbedded within these groups to get to the bottom of where all this leftist radicalization is coming from. We got their plans, manuals, intercepted internal communications, and have recordings of their zoom chats. What you are about to see is part of a two year undercover investigation into the leftist radicalization imbedded within the climate justice movement that contributed to the riots in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this first video, we are going to show how the Sunrise Movement played a preemptive role in carrying out the mayhem, taking advantage of George Floyd's death and using it as a trigger point, to further push their Green New Deal agenda and promoting the abolition of the police. We didn├втВмтДвt expect to find organizers radicalizing middle school and high school children teaching them military tactics and preparation for high risk actions. Some of these tactics include escalation provocation techniques, blocking freeway traffic, and how to get arrested bogging-down law enforcement in the name of destroying capitalism to make way for the Green New Deal. What some parents may have though were innocent youth organizations genuinely fostered and ran by children are actually top-down monolithic structures with private intelligence, military contractors, and foreign interests influencing children to carry out their subversive objectives. The events that erupted in Minneapolis, Minnesota were not a spontaneous reaction to the murder of George Floyd. These were well planned events anticipating some perfect trigger point to bring about the ├втВм┼Уnew normal├втВм┬Э - a world without police, without borders, without industry, without wealth, without private property, without an economy - a world based on communist ideals imbedded within the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is not about climate change, it is about climate justice - a radical new ideology hellbent on destroying western civilization under the false pretense that white supremacy is the leading cause of climate change, social injustice and all problems globally. The organizers of these Youth Non-government Organizations, or Youngos, embellish white supremacy as a systemic problem, hyper-focusing on statistically rare instances of racial inequality and injustice, while ignoring great strides of progress the United States has made over the past century towards equal opportunity and criminal justice reform. However, in order to normalize radical policies put forth by the Green New Deal, crises have to be capitalized on to further their agenda while destroying the great accomplishments of civil rights movements of the past.

4808,Thousands march in peaceful anti-racism protest in Montreal,"An entire tactical unit of a US police department has quit after two officers accused of brutality were placed on unpaid leave, reports local media. In a video that went viral on Thursday, officers in the city of Buffalo, New York, were seen shoving an elderly man to the ground. The 75-year-old was seriously injured, and taken to hospital. All 57 officers in the riot squad have now reportedly resigned in protest at their two colleagues' suspension. According to the Buffalo News, the members have stepped down from the Emergency Response Team, but not the police department itself. John Evans, president of the local police union, told the newspaper: ""Our position is these officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square. ""It doesn't specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40. They were simply doing their job. I don't know how much contact was made. He did slip in my estimation. He fell backwards."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday the two officers should be fired, and called for the incident to be investigated for ""possible criminal charges"". In a statement, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said: ""We can confirm that contingency plans are in place to maintain police services and ensure public safety within our community."" He added that Buffalo police are continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies. The officers were enforcing a curfew as a result of protests that have spread nationwide since the death in Minneapolis last month of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The man is seen approaching a group of riot police as they advance. Two of the officers appear to push the 75-year-old, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had ""tripped"" and fallen during a ""skirmish involving protesters"". Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident. His name is Martin Gugino, and authorities said he was taken to hospital, where he was in a stable but serious condition on Friday. Mr Gugino is a longtime social justice activist in Buffalo, according to advocacy group Push (People United for Sustainable Housing). He ""has been a tireless fighter against injustice of all types for many years in our city both with Push and other grassroots organisations,"" they said in a statement, condemning police for his treatment.

4839,Justin Trudeau takes a knee at anti-Black racism protest in Ottawa,"Democratic Senators have blocked a Republican police reform bill, leaving the legislation dead on the floor of Congress and likely defeating any Federal attempt to address police reform as a whole. The bill failed before its text ever made it to the floor. Democrats were able to marshal their caucus to defeat a vote designed to bring the issue to the floor for debate and killed the bill 55-45. A total of 60 votes would have been necessary to move the bill forward. ├втВм┼УRepublicans had 53 votes, but not enough Democrats joined them,├втВм┬Э Fox News reports. Only Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) crossed partisan lines. Democrats fought the Republican bill, led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which they said did not go far enough in addressing critical issues at the crux of police reform. The bill did not ban the use of chokeholds outright, preferring instead to warn departments to craft their own policies against the practice or risk losing federal funds. The bill also shied away from outlawing so-called ├втВм┼Уno-knock├втВм┬Э warrants, preferring instead to establish a national database to track those warrants├втВмтДв use and abuse. The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has its own bill which the Democratic caucus plans to bring to the floor there on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was apoplectic about the situation in an interview that took place just after the procedural vote failed. ├втВм┼УThe Senate was supposed to officially take up police reform on the floor today. Instead, our Democratic colleagues are poised to turn this routine step into a partisan impasse,├втВм┬Э he told reporters, adding that the bill could have been the subject of debate and compromise, but Democrats refused to come to the bargaining table. McConnell called Democrats├втВмтДв strategy in proposing the bill ├втВм┼Уbizarre,├втВм┬Э particularly given that they refused to even agree to debate the measure. ├втВм┼УThey don├втВмтДвt want a debate, they don├втВмтДвt want amendments, they├втВмтДвll filibuster police reform from even reaching the floor of the Senate unless the majority lets the minority rewrite the bill behind closed doors in advance,├втВм┬Э McConnell said. The lead up to Wednesday├втВмтДвs vote has been acrimonious, sometimes to a shocking degree. Speaking late Tuesday, Pelosi accused Republicans, including Scott ├втВмтАЭ the first black man to serve in both the House and Senate ├втВмтАЭ of ├втВм┼Уtrying to get away with murder, actually ├втВмтАЬ the murder of George Floyd.├втВм┬Э When pressed on the fact that her statement could be considered racially charged, Pelosi refused to apologize. On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked McConnell directly, warning the ranking Republican that he did not have ├втВм┼УCivil Rights leaders├втВм┬Э on his side. Since it is unlikely that the Senate will take up any House bill on the issue of police reform, it├втВмтДвs likely that efforts have ended to pass federal legislation on the matter, despite a nationwide movement.

5335,BLM Protests Spark calls for Dixie Chicks to Change Their Name,"President Donald Trump announced a crackdown on nationwide anti-racism protests in a surreal speech Monday from the White House Rose Garden while police flash-bang explosions could be heard nearby. Speaking as police deployed tear gas on protesters just outside the White House, Trump vowed harsher action against protesters. The president made no mention of violent actions taken by police in recent days against protesters, nor did he make any call for national unity. Instead, he said he would mobilize ├втВм┼Уall available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights.├втВм┬Э He specifically called on governors across the country to deploy the National Guard and vowed to deploy the U.S. military if states refused to comply. ├втВм┼УMayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,├втВм┬Э Trump said. Activating the military would require Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy active-duty military on U.S. soil. The statute was last used during the 1992 uprising in Los Angeles over the acquittals of police officers involved in the brutal beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist. Protesters were peacefully gathered outside the White House even as Trump began speaking. Authorities, however, fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades in an attempt to move them away from the area before the president├втВмтДвs address began. We can hear the explosions from the streets as Trump is speaking in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/yRporcjN0T Here's the moment where police fired teargas into a crowd of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park, just minutes before Trump's address in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/KPjxMKdDyx The public areas around the White House, particularly Lafayette Square, have been host to demonstrations for four days. On Sunday night, peaceful gatherings turned violent as police clashed with some protesters and several nearby buildings were vandalized or burned. Calling himself ├втВм┼Уyour law-and-order president,├втВм┬Э Trump pledged to escalate efforts to clamp down on the protests in Washington. ├втВм┼УAs we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,├втВм┬Э Trump said. As his remarks ended, Trump said he was leaving to go pay his respects ├втВм┼Уto a very, very special place.├втВм┬Э He later walked through Lafayette Park, which had minutes earlier been filled with demonstrators, on his way to St. John├втВмтДвs Church, where he posed for a photo while holding up a Bible and then left. Trump holds up a bible, literally shushes reporters trying to ask him about his threat to use the military against citizens, poses for a photo, and leaves. pic.twitter.com/w2lPWWjMKu The president├втВмтДвs remarks came amid nationwide protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of American cities demanding justice for Floyd and other Black victims of police brutality. In many of those cities, police have deployed violent tactics to attempt to quell demonstrations, including firing rubber bullets and tear gas, pepper-spraying crowds and hitting people with batons. Trump has been at odds with several governors as protests over Floyd├втВмтДвs death have spread across the nation. In a call on Monday, he said state leaders were ├втВм┼Уweak,├втВм┬Э urging them to arrest demonstrators and ├втВм┼Уput them in jail for 10 years.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УYou have to dominate. If you don├втВмтДвt dominate, you├втВмтДвre wasting your time,├втВм┬Э the president said during the call. ├втВм┼УThey├втВмтДвre going to run over you. You├втВмтДвre going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.├втВм┬Э The language built on Trump├втВмтДвs vocal denouncements of demonstrators as ├втВм┼Уthugs.├втВм┬Э In a widely criticized missive on Twitter, the president threatened violent intervention and said he would send in the National Guard should protests continue. ├втВм┼УAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,├втВм┬Э he said of the rising protests in Minneapolis at the time. Twitter quickly appended a note to the tweet, saying it violated rules about glorifying violence. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here├втВмтДвs how.",1,3,0,0
5357,"Chinese firm bids lowest for Delhi-Meerut project, RSS wing protests","Following weeks of protests about police brutality and racism, many activists have begun calling out the band Dixie Chicks to change their name, claiming the word ├втВм┼УDixie├втВм┬Э harbors ├втВм┼Уthe epitome of white America.├втВм┬Э The Dixie Chicks, a band composed of Natalie Maines and twin sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer, is a country band that was started in 1989. The Chicks soared to popularity until a comment by Maines about President George W. Bush in 2003 sent their career on a downward spiral from which it never fully recovered. In London for a concert, Maines told the crowd in 2003, ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.├втВм┬Э They were instantly dropped from multiple country radio stations and boycotted by most of their fans. With the announcement of a comeback album called ├втВм┼УGaslighter,├втВм┬Э slated to release in July 2020, the band was asked about changing its name because of the alleged racial connotations tied to it. According to dictionary.com, the word ├втВм┼Уdixie├втВм┬Э describes ├втВм┼Уthe southern states of the United States, especially those that were formerly part of the Confederacy.├втВм┬Э The origin of the word ├втВм┼Уdixie├втВм┬Э being used to describe the southern states is unknown, but some believe it could have been after Jeremiah Dixon, one of the men who established the Mason-Dixon Line, or after ├втВм┼Уdix├втВм┬Э which was the name of a Louisiana $10 bill before the Civil War. Other theories are that it could have come about due to the song ├втВм┼УDixie├втВм┬Э that was written by Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859, or that a slave owner named ├втВм┼УDix├втВм┬Э was so kind to his slaves that when they left, they had fond memories of living in ├втВм┼УDixie├втВмтДвs Land.├втВм┬Э Variety has a different approach, saying that dixie is ├втВм┼Уthe epitome of white America, a celebration of a Southern tradition that is invisible from Black Slaves and those grand plantations where they were forced to toil for free.├втВм┬Э As of this writing, the Dixie Chicks have not released a statement regarding their name. The Chicks are not the only band that has been pressured to make a name change. Popular country band and five-time Grammy award winners Lady Antebellum recently changed their name to Lady A because of the meaning of ├втВм┼Уantebellum.├втВм┬Э The band, comprised of Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood, posted a statement on its Instagram page. It partly reads, ├втВм┼УWe feel like we have been Awakened, but this is just one step. There are countless more that need to be taken. We want to do better. We are committed to examining our individual and collective impact and making the necessary changes to practice antiracism.├втВм┬Э The word ├втВм┼Уantebellum├втВм┬Э is Latin and means ├втВм┼Уbefore the war.├втВм┬Э While it seems vague, many agree that it is referring to the Civil War specifically. While the band├втВмтДвs name change was met with some praise, not everyone was happy. Rogan O├втВмтДвHandley, a lawyer and journalist, tweeted, ├втВм┼УI would love to say I├втВмтДвm now boycotting Lady Antebellum b/c of their cowardice, but I never liked their music anyway.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УLove your music. Now it is tainted to me forever. How easy it is to follow the sheep,├втВм┬Э one fan said. Another fan responded to the news, ├втВм┼УYep I├втВмтДвm out. You just don├втВмтДвt have what it takes.

5453,"18-Year-Old Activist Had Teeth Knocked Out By Police At Columbus Statue Protest, Officials Say","By Rem Rieder and D'Angelo Gore Posted on June 1, 2020 President Donald Trump has made false statements and implications about how three Democratic officials responded to violent protests that followed George Floyd├втВмтДвs death in police custody in Minneapolis: The inaccuracies come as the president has scolded state and local officials, often singling out Democrats, for not being tough enough in dealing with protests. In a conference call June 1, Trump told the nation├втВмтДвs governors they were ├втВм┼Уweak├втВм┬Э and said they needed to act more aggressively in quelling violent behavior. The president, in a series of tweets May 30, praised the Secret Service for its work protecting the White House as an unruly crowd of more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the White House early that morning. At the same time, Trump charged that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser wouldn├втВмтДвt let the D.C police help protect him. Trump, May 30: On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn├втВмтДвt let the D.C. Police get involved. ├втВм┼УNot their job.├втВм┬Э Nice! But the D.C. police were involved in the protection during the tumultuous protest, as this Washington Post article makes clear. ├втВм┼УBowser and D.C. police Chief Peter Newsham said city police had in fact joined with Secret Service and U.S. Park Police on Saturday to control the demonstrators on Pennsylvania Avenue, even supplying the Secret Service with extra protective gear,├втВм┬Э the article says. The Post also said its reporters covering the protests saw that D.C. Police were there. And the Secret Service said in a statement about the episode, ├втВм┼УThe Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.├втВм┬Э Trump also was off-base on May 31 when he tweeted that Philadelphia officials should call in the National Guard to help deal with widespread looting in the city, suggesting their failure to do so reflected a general weakness in the way Democrats dealt with civil unrest. But the guard had been called in hours before Trump├втВмтДвs 4 p.m. tweet. Trump, May 31 tweet: Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. The guard was already on the way. At a noon press conference of city officials that day, Philadelphia Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said, ├втВм┼УWe have requested support from the Pennsylvania National Guard.├втВм┬Э At a 6 p.m. press conference, Philadelphia Managing Director Brian Abernathy reiterated that the National Guard was en route and was expected later that night. He said the guard├втВмтДвs role would be to support the local police and act as a ├втВм┼Уforce multiplier.├втВм┬Э National Guard troops began arriving in Center City Philadelphia around 1 a.m. June 1 and were on patrol by dawn. Trump also suggested ├втВмтАЭ falsely ├втВмтАЭ that members of Minnesota├втВмтДвs National Guard didn├втВмтДвt arrive in Minneapolis to assist local and state law enforcement control crowds until the evening of May 30. ├втВм┼УCongratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night,├втВм┬Э Trump tweeted May 31. ├втВм┼УThe ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!├втВм┬Э At least some Minnesota National Guard soldiers and airmen had been deployed to Minneapolis for duty the night of May 28. Early that day, after a second day of demonstrations in Minneapolis over Floyd├втВмтДвs death became increasingly violent, including looting, fires being set and a fatal shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey officially declared a local emergency and called for the state├втВмтДвs National Guard to be deployed to his city. (Frey├втВмтДвs office told us he actually asked for that help May 27, as the Star-Tribune reported.) But it was up to Minnesota├втВмтДвs governor, Tim Walz, to authorize the activation of the state├втВмтДвs National Guard, which he did by signing an executive order the afternoon of May 28. (At a roundtable discussion with business executives May 29, Trump left the inaccurate impression that he had called in National Guard troops to Minneapolis, saying ├втВм┼Уwe brought in the National Guard today.├втВм┬Э) After Walz signed the order, the Minnesota National Guard tweeted late on May 28 that it had ├втВм┼Уactivated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities.├втВм┬Э It├втВмтДвs true that Walz called for a fuller mobilization of the guard├втВмтДвs soldiers and airmen on May 30. In a tweet late that day, the Minnesota National Guard said, ├втВм┼УWe now have more than 4,100 ├втВмтАЭ quickly moving toward 10,800 ├втВмтАЭ Minnesota Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen supporting our friends and neighbors in the Twin Cities.├втВм┬Э That was ├втВм┼Уa significant increase over the 700 on-duty├втВм┬Э as of May 29, the tweet said. A public affairs official for the guard told us that about 7,000 members had been deployed as of June 1. Editor├втВмтДвs Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

5512,'Mitch better have my money': Unemployment benefits protest held outside McConnell's home,"Become a member Learn more Activist Miracle Boyd of GoodKids MadCity was injured by police in an attack caught on video. ""You beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue?"" Ald. Jeanette Taylor said. GRANT PARK ├втВмтАЭ An 18-year-old activist who had just spoken to a crowd protesting at the Christopher Columbus statue in Grant Park had several front teeth knocked out by a Chicago Police officer Friday evening, according to video and multiple elected officials. An outraged Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) said Miracle Boyd, 18, of the group GoodKids MadCity was assaulted by a police officer during the tense Friday night protest where police pepper-sprayed protesters trying to tear down a towering, nearly 90-year-old statue of Columbus. Taylor, who knows Boyd, said the rising young activist was injured by police. Boyd was filming the encounter, in which she argued with officers away from the Columbus statue. At the end of her recording, her phone appears to be knocked away. A second video, posted to Twitter from someone filming across the street, shows an officer wearing shorts and a bike helmet swinging his left hand at her. She flees after he swings. .@chicagosmayor we now have the video of Miracle being sucker punched by CPD! They don├втВмтДвt keep us safe!

Taylor said watching video of the attack horrified her. Taylor├втВмтДвs daughter is good friends with Boyd. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm going to tell you right now, if this was my kid ├втВмтАЭ and Miracle is one of mine ├втВмтАЭ I would burn this city to the ground,├втВм┬Э Taylor said. ├втВм┼УYou beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue? ├втВм┼УThey├втВмтДвre so busy protecting white supremacy, they├втВмтДвre so busy protecting a Christopher Columbus statue that they beat her.├втВм┬Э On Sunday, Boyd told Block Club she had been trying to assist a protester she saw being arrested when two officers approached her, one with dark gray facial hair and sunglasses. ├втВм┼УHe walked up to me and smacked me,├втВм┬Э Boyd said Sunday. ├втВм┼УI don├втВмтДвt know if the phone hit me in the mouth, I don├втВмтДвt know if his hand hit me in the mouth. ├втВм┼УBut the way that I was recording, I think that he tried to smack the phone in my hand and he hit me at the same time, and the phone hit me in the mouth, and it knocked my tooth out and I was bleeding.├втВм┬Э RELATED: Protesters Try To Tear Down Columbus Statue In Chicago As Clashes Between Police, Activists Turn Violent GoodKids MadCity tweeted in the aftermath, showing Boyd suffered multiple injuries to her face and chipped teeth. They later tweeted the video footage they said showed a police officer beating Boyd in the face. Essence Gatheright, a 16-year-old member of Chicago Freedom School├втВм╦Ьs youth leadership board who was at the protest, said Boyd spoke at the rally earlier that night. Gatheright helped get Boyd get medical attention at the Freedom School after she was hit. ├втВм┼УHer teeth came out, it was really bad,├втВм┬Э Gatheright said. ├втВм┼УShe was bleeding, she kept crying and sobbing. It was a really messed up situation. ├втВм┬ж We were able to walk her and others to the school and provide her with support and make sure she got home safely.├втВм┬Э Ald. Taylor said Boyd is ├втВм┼Уa good kid, a CPS graduate├втВм┬Э who has helped raise money for the most vulnerable in her community. ├втВм┼УI don├втВмтДвt care if you become the president, the mayor, the garbage man ├втВмтАЭ you are not exempt from this country and what its racist ass will do to you,├втВм┬Э Taylor said. Through tears, Taylor said she was tired. ├втВм┼УHow many more times are we going to go through this?├втВм┬Э State Sen.

She said more policing is not the answer and demanded that Mayor Lori Lightfoot divest from the Chicago Police Department and direct the money to communities instead. ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre the people of the community. I don├втВмтДвt see you [Mayor Lightfoot] out here organizing people,├втВм┬Э Boyd said. ├втВм┼У├втВм┬ж We are the ones in our community that have to deal with the trauma.├втВм┬Э She was recently featured in a Block Club Chicago story about the Washington Park protest. She also co-wrote a story about activism in Injustice Watch. Friday evening├втВмтДвs protest ended in in clashes between police and demonstrators, some of whom attempted to pull down the statute of Christopher Columbus in the southern edge of the park. Police eventually converged on the area, using pepper spray to push back protesters. Video tweeted from reporters and demonstrators shows multiple physical confrontation. In a statement, the Chicago Police News Affairs office said it was not aware of the Boyd incident. ├втВм┼УThe Chicago Police Department strives to treat all individuals our officers encounter with respect,├втВм┬Э according to the statement. ├втВм┼УWe do not tolerate misconduct of any kind and if any wrongdoing is discovered, officers will be held accountable. Anyone who feels they have been mistreated by a CPD officer is encouraged to call 311 and file a complaint with COPA, who will investigate allegations of misconduct.├втВм┬Э During the protest last week in Washington Park, Boyd and other activists detailed proposals about reducing violence in their communities, calling on the city to reallocate 2 percent of the Chicago police budget to services like robust mental health, schools and grocery stores. That money would help support violence interrupters and other residents doing ground-level work to keep communities safe through direct action with gang members. Peace treaties, accountability, trauma-healing and a restorative justice process are all part of the plan, Boyd said. You can donate to help Boyd with needed medical care here.

5649,Multiple churches ├втВм╦Ьburned and vandalized├втВмтДв across US as cops investigate possible links to statue protests,"A Northeast Florida Sheriff facing a competitive primary used department resources to make a self-promotional video this week under the guise of combatting civil unrest. The message to would-be protesters: ├втВм┼УYou├втВмтДвve been warned.├втВм┬Э (The message to political opponents, meanwhile, is one of the power and prerogatives of incumbency, especially in a crowded field of candidates.) Clay County Sheriff Darryl Daniels released Tuesday a red meat video vowing to, if needed, deputize gun owners in the event Black Lives Matter protesters came into the county. ├втВм┼УSomebody has to step up in front of the camera and say ├втВм╦Ьenough is enough,'├втВм┬Э said Daniels, vowing that ├втВм┼Уif we can├втВмтДвt handle you ├втВм┬ж. I├втВмтДвll make special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county.├втВм┬Э The warning (not a ├втВм┼Уthreat,├втВм┬Э Daniels says repeatedly), is especially interesting, given that Camp Blanding, from which the National Guard could deploy as it did during riots in actual cities, is in the county. The three-minute video is full of the kind of bluster that traditionally plays well in Clay. ├втВм┼УIf you threaten to come to Clay County and think for one second we├втВмтДвll bend our backs for you, you├втВмтДвre sadly mistaken,├втВм┬Э Daniels said. ├втВм┼УYou can threaten all you want, you can say ├втВм╦Ьlet├втВмтДвs go to Clay County├втВмтДв,├втВм┬Э but ├втВм┼Уyou├втВмтДвll have something waiting for you you don├втВмтДвt want,├втВм┬Э he added. ├втВм┼УThe second you step out from under the protection of the Constitution, we├втВмтДвll be waiting for you, and you├втВмтДвll have everything you want. All the publicity, all the pain, all the glamour and glory, for all that five minutes will give you,├втВм┬Э Daniels promised, in a video that plays up contrasts between Clay County and urban areas, with a little flash for Fox News should they pick it up. ├втВм┼УGod is absent from the media├втВмтДвs message or Black Lives Matter or any other group out there that├втВмтДвs making themselves a spectacle,├втВм┬Э Daniels theorized. Wherever God is or isn├втВмтДвt, Daniels himself picked up earned media at the right time, running fourth in the money race for the August primary. Daniels, who has $38,514 on hand, trails opponents Ben Carroll, Michelle Cook, and Mike Taylor. Cook said Daniels was acting like a ├втВм┼Уreality show sheriff├втВм┬Э and called the video a ├втВм┼Уpolitical scam.├втВм┬Э However, in a seven-way race, the ability to leverage the public resources with the needs of a corporate media starved for any content that affirms the social order has a value that won├втВмтДвt show up in campaign finance, but could show up in October. Despite an FDLE investigation dating to last summer, polling this spring showed Daniels well positioned in August, with strong approval numbers. This video probably won├втВмтДвt hurt those numbers.

July 3, 2020 at 12:12 am huh? he said he is protecting the constitution not stepping out from it. sheesh you people already twisting words July 1, 2020 at 12:02 pm This man is an utter disgrace. Of course, the fact that he feels comfortable indulging in such barbaric campaign speech is itself a reflection of the mindset of the plurality of voters he├втВмтДвs pandering to. Has he forgotten about his adulterous comings and goings with a former JSO corrections officer that he seemingly had arrested under false pretenses to cover up his dirty tracks? Some voters surely haven├втВмтДвt forgotten. A pitiful joke, he is. Its time for Clay to elect a new sheriff.

Tearing up businesses, destroying historical monuments, attacking police and civilians is a felony and should be treated as such!

You should be fired. July 1, 2020 at 12:21 pm EXACTLY! These liberals are so dense they have blurred the lines between legitimate peaceful protestors and rioters and looters! To think that rioters and looters have the same Constitutional right to destroy property and harm citizens is INSANE! No one, NO ONE is going to stop ME from protecting myself, my family, my property, and the public property that my tax dollars support! NO ONE! July 2, 2020 at 9:27 pm Amen July 1, 2020 at 12:32 pm Bunch of cry babies in these comments. Stay out, stay away or else. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Fair warning. Enough is enough.

July 1, 2020 at 1:44 pm Well the first paragraph of this article certainly makes it clear which side the author is on. I am so sick and tired of the gd media and their support of the lawless and violent rioters, looters, and vandals that are desecrating monuments, destroying businesses and private property in our cities. I say hooray for this sheriff and if I was in Clay I would gladly volunteer to become a deputy in his service. As is it I am ready and waiting for these maggots to come to my neck of the woods. Got my Mossberg 12 gauge pump and 100 rounds of ammo ready and waiting. Bring it scumbags! July 1, 2020 at 1:47 pm Good for the residents of Clay county. July 1, 2020 at 1:50 pm boy bye├втВм┬ж July 1, 2020 at 3:00 pm What and idiot! Deputies any and everybody with a gun. That makes perfect sense. We see what happens when trained people are given a weapon a and badge. What could possible go wrong with a bunch of hyped up hot heads walking around with guns ready to shoot. July 1, 2020 at 3:27 pm Would you rather the sheriff sit back and let the rioters and looters come in and burn down businesses and let them beat and kill the people that lives there?or shoot the police officers that are trying to protect us? I guess I├втВмтДвm one of them hyped up hotheads cause I will shoot anyone that tries to harm my family or property! What would you do if they came after you and your family?? July 1, 2020 at 4:03 pm What ├втВм┼УAND├втВм┬Э idiot? You must be talking to yourself. Deputize <├втВмтАЭ not Deputies Also if you paid any attention to the video, he said he would deputize every ""LAWFUL GUN OWNER"" in the county. One other thing, please take note, this is a duly elected BLACK man speaking out against the terrorist organization BLM. More power to him. July 1, 2020 at 3:57 pm AMEN!!!!! That├втВмтДвs how things get back in order. Way to go Sheriff. July 1, 2020 at 4:22 pm About time a politician took steps to protect the voting public, as opposed to pandering to looters and rioters. He stated that he might deputize ├втВм┼Уlawful gun owning citizens├втВм┬Э. I would guess he is referencing gun owning concealed carry permit holders. Those same honest citizens whose finger prints, photo and background checks have been performed. Of course the ultra liberal snowflakes oppose this. That is until they are threatened├втВм┬ж July 1, 2020 at 4:44 pm Not from Clay county, but definitely armed and will defend our property.

I want to move to Clay County. I admire the sheriff├втВмтДвs thinking. Enough lawlessness! July 1, 2020 at 6:32 pm Wow├втВм┬жI see a few leftists have found their way here. I guess it can├втВмтДвt be helped as the writer of this article is one of them. These ├втВм┼УUrnalists├втВм┬Э have enabled outright terrorism in our communities when they conflate peaceful protesters with rioters. His goal is to indoctrinate and activate the leftists. They need economic upheaval in order to beat Trump├втВм┬жand that├втВмтДвs when the fun really begins. The true goal is to eliminate the Electoral College so States like New York and California dictate who runs the country. The key players never get caught as there are useful idiots that will do their job for them. Have you ever noticed Antifa leading a pack of rioters only for them to disappear when the police show up? That of course brings us to the crux of the problem here├втВм┬жProtecting your homes, family, and neighbors are simply unacceptable to them. These are the same people not 6 months ago were screaming for you to disarm. First it was we just want the AR-15├втВмтДвs├втВм┬жthen they wanted all ├втВм┼Уassault rifles,├втВм┬Э and finally they claimed everyone├втВмтДвs semiautomatic weapons was their true target. Any real gun owner will tell you that 95% of all firearms in the US are semiautomatic. Then the so called ├втВм┼Уpeaceful protests├втВм┬Э broke out. Seattle was having their very own Woodstock love in. Accept that├втВмтДвs not exactly how it went down is it leftists? You had the warlord of Chaz (never call it Chop) handing out AR-15├втВмтДвs to drug addicts, felons, and 14 year old children (it├втВмтДвs been recorded). Where oh where were the anti-gun nuts when all of this was happening? That├втВмтДвs right, they were fueling the defund the police movement. You leftists have crossed a line you will never return from. We know what you├втВмтДвre trying to do and we see everyone of your cities collapse before our very eyes. We know that you├втВмтДвre nothing more than social vampires bleeding this nation of its resources. Too those in Clay County├втВм┬ж.do you honestly think they won├втВмтДвt come for you? At current the leftists are attempting to push into every conservative run city, county, and municipality. It├втВмтДвs only a matter of time before they make a stop in your town. Addendum- ├втВм┼УAssult rifle├втВм┬Э is a made up buzzword from the Clinton era. The ├втВм┼Уprotesters├втВм┬Э are anything but peaceful. Too those that watch the mass media today├втВм┬жthey├втВмтДвre all lying to you. If you want the real truth seek independent media. Tim Pool on YouTube is a great place to start.

5721,Florida sheriff: I'll deputize gun owners if violent protests erupt,"Laurel Wamsley As protests for racial justice in Portland have continued for more than 50 nights, striking new images and tactics have emerged ├втВмтАЬ particularly in resistance to the federal law enforcement officers whose actions have earned the ire of Oregonians who want them to leave. A group of women who call themselves the Wall of Moms has drawn national attention, clad in bike helmets and goggles. They link arms to form a protective barrier between law enforcement and Black Lives Matter protesters who took to the streets after the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. In a recent moment captured on video, a large crowd of the yellow-garbed women sing as if a lullaby, ""Hands up, please don't shoot me."" Moms sing lullaby ├втВм┼Уhands up please don├втВмтДвt shoot me├втВм┬Э pic.twitter.com/GJhj8ymn12 Members of the Wall of Moms say they follow the directions of Black leaders, and that their driving vision is that ""we moms would take some physical hits in hopes our Black and Brown kids, friends, neighbors, and loved ones will be spared some pain."" In another video, also taken by freelance journalist Sergio Olmos, a protester uses a hockey stick to push back a canister of tear gas. Another uses a leaf blower to blow back the gas, a tactic used last year by protesters in Hong Kong. A protester uses a hockey stick to swing tear gas canister back, another uses a leaf blower pic.twitter.com/GSdFeErinC State and local leaders have repeatedly called for federal agents to leave the city, arguing that their presence has made an already-tense environment worse. ""The federal police have their marching orders on how they're going to do things,"" Portland Police Association President Daryl Turner told NPR on Tuesday. ""And that coordination was not made with Portland police."" In response to both the federal actions in Portland and the implied threat by President Trump to deploy federal officers to other U.S. cities, more than a dozen U.S. mayors have sent an open letter to Attorney General William Barr and Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The letter calls on the Department of Justice and DHS to withdraw the forces from American cities and halt plans to send any more. ""Deployment of federal forces in the streets of our communities has not been requested nor is it acceptable. While U.S. Marshals have had jurisdiction inside federal courthouses for decades, it is unacceptable and chilling that this administration has formed and deployed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Rapid Deployment Unit and is sending federal authorities to conduct crowd control on city streets and detain individuals,"" the mayors write. They point to the federal officers' use of less-lethal munitions against protesters that have caused serious injury and to the grabbing of people off the street and pulling them into unmarked vehicles. ""These are tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes ├втВмтАЬ not our democracy,"" the mayors write. On Tuesday, Wolf said, ""Portland is unique,"" arguing that local officials and police hadn't done enough to control what he said was violence stemming from the nightly protests, and saying those protests increasingly threaten federal buildings downtown. Asked about Trump's threat to send federal officers into other cities, Wolf said reporters could ""ask the White House."" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the situation in Portland had been starting to calm before federal forces arrived. ""The harsh reality is, this is about scoring political points with [Trump's] base,"" Brown told PBS NewsHour on Monday. ""This is about political theater. If they were really interested in problem-solving or in public safety, they would be willing to de-escalate and engage in dialogue."" She added, ""Instead, they bring more troops to the streets. They take peaceful protesters off into unmarked cars. And, unfortunately, last weekend, they almost killed a peaceful protester. This is absolutely outrageous. It is a violation of the principles on which this country was founded."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",1,3,0,0
5834,FEMA denies Minnesota├втВмтДвs request for aid for protest cleanup,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. A NUMBER of Catholic churches have been torched and vandalized in the US as cops investigate whether this is linked to the ongoing statue protests. Houses of worship are being burned after George Floyd's police custody death in Minneapolis on May 25, which sparked widespread outrage and anti-racism rallies. Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King urged demonstrators to ""tear"" down Jesus Christ statues and murals because he said they are ""a form of white supremacy"" on Twitter. While Confederate monuments are being taken down all over the country, Christian statues are reportedly being vandalized and churches have been set on fire. In the city of Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mission, a 249-year-old Catholic church, was engulfed in flames in the early hours of Saturday morning. CNN reported that firefighters and emergency responders fought the blaze for three hours as the ancient ceiling and roof began to cave in. The church was preparing to mark its upcoming 250th anniversary celebration before the alleged arson attack, causing severe water and smoke damage. It came under criticism because of the surrounding statues of St Junipero Serra, which have been toppled by BLM protesters in other areas. Critics say the 18th-century Franciscan priest was complicit in an imperial conquest that oppressed Native Americans. ""One of the factors investigators are taking into account is the recent vandalism to the statues of the saint, specifically in the Los Angeles region,"" San Gabriel Fire Department fire captain Antonio Negrete said. ├втВм┼УThis will be another box that they├втВмтДвre going to check off,├втВм┬Э he told Fox11. ""It's a tragic loss for our city. It's our city identifier."" Elsewhere, in San Diego, the police department├втВмтДвs Metro Arson Strike Team are investigating a ""suspicious"" 12.30 pm blaze at Calvary Baptist church on Sunday. Although it's a historically Black church, it has become a ├втВм┼Уmulti-cultural faith community,"" as per its website. Around the same time as the LA blaze, a man in Florida mowed his vehicle into the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala ahead of morning Mass on Saturday. Steven Anthony Shields, 24, from Dunnellon allegedly poured gasoline in the foyer, set the building on fire, and drove off, as per the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was arrested and charged with attempted murder, arson, burglary, and evading arrest. Shields described the incident as ""awesome,"" saying he was on a ""mission"" as he smiled and laughed, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Ocala Star-Banner. He cited issues with the Catholic Church but Shields also reportedly has schizophrenia and isn't taking his medication. Nevertheless, Mass was celebrated Saturday and Sunday, local outlets said, despite the damage to the foyer. Elsewhere, Missouri authorities are looking into a suspected arson attack in Johnson County, where a 100-year-old church went up in flames. Harmony Baptist Church was burned to the ground at 11.22 pm on July 5, according to Johnson County Fire Protection District. It took over two hours for firefighters from four stations and 50,000 gallons of water to get a handle on the raging blaze, which caused between $400,000 and $500,000 of damage. Security camera footage shows the arson suspect parking outside and then entering the building before setting the building alight, local reports said. ├втВм┼УThe loss of the historic church will have a lasting effect on the rural community and members of the church,"" Fire Chief Larry Jennings told The Sun. ""It will take a community effort to identify those responsible for the fire and to help the congregation as they move forward.├втВм┬Э It isn't known if this arson attack is connected with the ongoing protests and Jennings said there is no current evidence to suggest it is related as the probe continues. But it's not just churches that are going up in flames. In Massachusetts, cops are investigating a suspected arson attack on a statue of the Virgin Mary on Saturday night. Catholic News Agency reported that the statue is located outside St Peter├втВмтДвs Parish in Boston├втВмтДвs Dorchester neighborhood. Police responded to a fire on Bowdin Street at around 10 pm on July 11. The statue of Mary sustained heavy damage after an unknown individual set fire to the plastic flower's in the statue's hands. This caused smoke and flame damage to the face, head, and upper body of the statue. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Boston described the unknown culprit as ""a troubled soul."" ""Boston Fire Department has just begun its investigation, so we don├втВмтДвt have a sense what was the reason behind this action,"" Terrence C. Donilon, their Secretary for Communications & Public Affairs, told The Sun. ""That said, whoever is responsible for the desecration of the Holy Mother├втВмтДвs statue is clearly a troubled soul. ""Mary represents all that is good and pure in our world. We have confidence in local law enforcement to investigate this matter. We pray for the person or persons responsible."" Another Blessed Virgin Mary statue outside Cathedral Prep School and Seminary in New York City was desecrated on July 10 with the word ├втВм┼УIDOL."" The NYPD confirmed that they are investigating the vandalization of the statue, which occurred shortly after 3am on Friday, July 10. On the security footage, someone can be seen approaching the 100-year-old statue and spray painting the word across it, before fleeing the scene. The NYPD have appealed to the public for help in identifying the culprit of this ""criminal mischief incident."" Rector and president of Cathedral Prep Fr James Kuroly told The Sun this vandalism was ├втВм┼Уan act of hatred"" on Tuesday. ""I don't think there's a connection per say [with the protests] like it's organized,"" he said. ""I do think it's where we are as a society and as a country where there has been so much division and so much focus on what separates us and when we focus on that division, it leads to ignorance and it leads to acts of hatred. ""It really does symbolize the state of affairs that we are in right now as a society,"" he added. ""There has certainly been an outpouring of support [from the local community].""

5890,Virginia state officials order large American flag taken down amid July 4 protest fears,"Minnesota, you├втВмтДвre on your own. About a week after Gov. Tim Walz wrote to President Trump requesting federal aid to repair widespread damage in Minneapolis and St. Paul from the fiery George Floyd protests, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rebuffed the request for a financial helping hand. The state has estimated total damages at more than $500 million, and Walz specifically wrote in his July 2 letter that $15 million in cleanup and repair costs could be eligible for federal reimbursement. ├втВм┼УThe governor is disappointed that the federal government declined his request for financial support ... to help Minnesota rebuild after civil unrest damaged public infrastructure and caused extensive fire damage in the wake of George Floyd├втВмтДвs death,├втВм┬Э spokesman Teddy Tschann said in a statement. ├втВм┼УAs we navigate one of the most difficult periods in our state├втВмтДвs history, we look for support from our federal government to help us through,├втВм┬Э he said. Hundreds of buildings in the Twin Cities were destroyed by fires, looted or damaged during the nightly protests following Floyd├втВмтДвs May 25 death beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis cop. A local police precinct was among the structures torched during the demonstrations. Walz noted in his letter that it was ├втВм┼Уthe second most destructive incident of civil unrest in United States history after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.├втВм┬Э The governor noted the state budget was further crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an anticipated $1.5 billion surplus morphing into a projected deficit of $2.4 billion. FEMA, in a statement provided to Minnesota Public Radio, said the turndown came after a ├втВм┼Уthorough review├втВм┬Э of the state├втВмтДвs request for the funds as a major disaster area. ├втВм┼УIt was determined that the impact to public infrastructure is within the capabilities of the local and state governments to recover from,├втВм┬Э the statement concluded. Minnesota officials now have 30 days to appeal the federal rejection, with the governor├втВмтДвs spokesman saying his office was ├втВм┼Уexploring more options├втВм┬Э to resolve its dire financial situation.",1,2,0,0
5999,"When the American public thinks the US military has assumed a law enforcement role in quelling protests, 'It creates the perception that the U.S. military is being used to suppress the American people,' said retired Marine Col. David Lapan.","A Black Lives Matter rally, billed to attract thousands in Sydney, was shut down by police before it began and its organiser arrested. The event in The Domain, which almost 5000 people had registered on Facebook to attend, came to nothing as NSW Police ordered protesters to disperse, 15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin at midday on Tuesday. See police shut the protest down in the video above Hundreds of police were on duty at the park and six arrests were made. Of the six, five were fined $1000 each and a sixth person, a 25-year-old woman, was issued a criminal infringement notice for offensive language. Organiser Paddy Gibson was one of those arrested and said supporters were asked to gather in groups of fewer than 20 after they failed on Monday to overturn a NSW Supreme Court decision prohibiting the protest. Gibson said organisers directed protesters to leave peacefully and without confronting police after being told mass arrests would otherwise occur. He said he├втВмтДвd been told by police that despite The Domain├втВмтДвs size, only 20 people would be permitted in the park. ├втВм┼УWe weren├втВмтДвt allowed to give it a run even though Westfield is allowed, as well as the casino and the NRL,├втВм┬Э the 37 year old said. ├втВм┼УPeople are allowed to come together to make profits but they├втВмтДвre not allowed to come together to say black lives matter - that├втВмтДвs a disgraceful situation in NSW. ├втВм┼УThey don├втВмтДвt want to see us build unity, build power, demand accountability and demand justice from this government because it├втВмтДвs too politically sensitive.├втВм┬Э Gibson said protesters would challenge any fines handed out. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing warned that protesters who intended to rally outside NSW parliament on Tuesday would be arrested. Justice Mark Ierace on Sunday accepted the police argument that the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19 arising from the Sydney rally made the event too risky. The appeal court, which will hand down its reasons soon, on Monday dismissed a challenge to Justice Ierace├втВмтДвs decision. Organisers previously said they would risk arrest and go ahead with the rally before delivering a 90,000-strong petition to NSW Parliament calling for justice for Indigenous man David Dungay Jr. Mr Dungay, aged 26 and a diabetic, died in December 2015 after five prison officers stormed his Sydney jail cell to stop him eating biscuits.

Virginia state officials ordered the removal of an American flag from the construction site in Richmond, citing concerns that the flag would become a ""target"" for protesters this Fourth of July.

6034,Iowa teachers 'Drive for Lives' to protest Reynolds' back-to-school requirements,"'They need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.' By Jeff Schogol | Published Jul 25, 2020 2:02 PM You can be forgiven for thinking that U.S. troops have been dispatched to the streets of Washington, D.C., Portland, and other cities in recent weeks. The news has been rife with concerning videos and images of little green men kitted out with military gear as they confront ├втВмтАЬ and sometimes beat ├втВмтАЬ protesters, including at least one U.S. Naval Academy alumnus. var siteRootDomainParts = window.location.host.split("".""); var siteRootDomain = window.location.host; if ( siteRootDomainParts.length >= 2 ) { siteRootDomain = siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 2] + ""."" + siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 1]; } cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: ""3c020dea-a94e-40a8-be0a-8a3170cc7c1b"", customParam1: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId + """", customParam2: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + """", customParam3: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + """", settings: { advertising: { macros: { cust_params: ""site="" + siteRootDomain + ""&targeting_article="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.externalId + ""&targeting_section="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + ""&targeting_keyword="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + ""&article="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, article: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, category: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section, keywords: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords, } } } }).render(""404a5343b1434e25bf26b4e6356298bc""); }); But the U.S. government has not declared martial law. The people wearing military camouflage uniforms ├втВмтАЬ and, in some cases, carrying M4 carbines ├втВмтАЬ are from federal law enforcement agencies. They are border patrol officers, U.S. Marshals, and other civilian police officers. They are not U.S. service members, no matter how much they may resemble them. ├втВм┼УWhen people who have served in the military for a long time have to look very hard at the photos and video from Portland and places like that to tell who these individuals [federal agents] are, then the average citizen is going to easily confuse what they see as a militarized response rather than a law enforcement one,├втВм┬Э said retired Marine Col. David Lapan, a former spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of Homeland Security. Indeed, some media outlets have erroneously referred to federal officers as troops ├втВмтАЭ and that misperception that the military has assumed a domestic law enforcement role is bad for democracy, according to Lapan ├втВм┼УIt creates the perception that the U.S. military is being used to suppress the American people.├втВм┬Э Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters on Wednesday that border patrol officers are wearing camouflage in Portland because that├втВмтДвs the uniform they wear when they are deployed to the southwestern border. ├втВм┼УThat is their everyday uniform and it is completely appropriate,├втВм┬Э Wolf said at a news briefing. ├втВм┼УThey have insignia on their uniforms that read police and they have patches ├втВм┬ж that indicate which agency they are from.├втВм┬Э Related: Stop what you're doing and watch this interview with the badass Navy vet who went viral in Portland Meanwhile, the U.S. Marshals in Portland who are wearing military uniforms belong to the agency├втВмтДвs Special Operations Group, said U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman Michelle Coghill. ├втВм┼УSOG relies on established Department of Defense research to ensure the best economic value for taxpayers and a high level of protection for its personnel, and sometimes procures specialized equipment also used by U.S. military forces, including uniforms, helmets, gas masks and protective gear for tactical operations,├втВм┬Э Coghill told Task & Purpose. The Defense Department doesn├втВмтДвt just provide equipment to the U.S. Marshals Service. Under the 1033 Program, the Defense Logistics Agency transfers a variety of excess military equipment to local police departments, including MRAP-All Terrain Vehicles. Related: A West Virginia town of 8,400 people just picked up an MRAP for some reason However, both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have stated that police should be distinguishable from U.S. service members so that the general public does not mistakenly think the military is performing law enforcement duties. The issue first arose during protests in Washington, D.C., in June after National Guardsmen and some federal authorities appeared in similar uniforms, Milley told the House Armed Services Committee recently. ├втВм┼УYou want a clear distinction ├втВмтАЬ visually ├втВмтАЬ visual distinction between that which is police and that which is military because when you start introducing [the] military, you├втВмтДвre talking a different level of effort there,├втВм┬Э Milley said during the July 9 hearing. During the 15 years that I├втВмтДвve had the honor to tell service members├втВмтДв stories, I├втВмтДвve learned that troops have no desire to serve as a national police force on American soil. As one crusty noncommissioned officer told me years ago, the military├втВмтДвs mission is ├втВм┼Уto go to where the terrorists live and f├втВмтАЬk up their neighborhoods.├втВм┬Э Still, active-duty troops have been used in response to civil unrest in the past, such as during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. It is also true that service members take an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic. If that├втВмтДвs the case, then why is it bad for democracy if Americans have a hard time distinguishing between domestic law enforcement agents and troops? One reason is that the public is generally not in favor of blurring the lines that separate the roles of police and the military, Lapan said. And while the Oath of Enlistment mentions domestic enemies, it was changed around the time of the Civil War because the Southern states had launched an insurrection. Related: Army grounds crew of helicopter that flew low over protests amid official investigation ├втВм┼УI think the context of ├втВм╦Ьdomestic enemies├втВмтДв lends itself more to the idea of someone that would try to overthrow the government,├втВм┬Э Lapan said. ├втВм┼УWe├втВмтДвre talking about that type of activity, not protests ├втВмтАЬ not even criminal activity.├втВм┬Э Normally, U.S. troops are used for humanitarian missions inside the United States, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Lapan added. In fact, when Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honor├Г┬й took command in New Orleans following the devastating 2005 hurricane, one of the first things he did was instill in every first responder that they were not in a war zone. ├втВм┼УPut those damn weapons down,├втВм┬Э Honor├Г┬й barked at both troops and police officers alike. ├втВм┼УI'm not going to tell you again, goddamn it! Get those goddamn weapons down!├втВм┬Э Related: Meet the former soldier who gave National Guardsmen in DC an impromptu phalanx lesson in this viral video Now retired, Honor├Г┬й was just as blunt when he told Task & Purpose that federal law enforcement officers have misappropriated military uniforms in order to look intimidating. ├втВм┼УLaw enforcement should not be wearing military uniforms,├втВм┬Э Honor├Г┬й said. ├втВм┼УMilitary uniforms are designed to blend into the terrain and it├втВмтДвs a function of identifying our soldiers on the ground.

More info Boris Johnson explained he doesn't want the public to be forced to take the knee by protesters. The Prime Minister highlighted that it would be difficult for police officers to do so after being verbally and physically attacked by Black Lives Matter protesters. Mr Johnson suggested he wouldn't take the knee out of fear it would make another person's life difficult. Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't believe in gestures, I believe in substance. I believe in doing things. ""If you look at what this Government has done over the last few years, when I was running this city, I massively increased black and minority representation in the Metropolitan Police. ""I want to see that happen across the country. ""What we've seen in the last 10 years is young black kids doing the toughest subjects in school, we've seen more young black kids going to the best universities in this country and that's what I want to see."" READ MORE: Boris Johnson ends furlough: PM says no more taxpayer support   Mr Ferrari pressed the Prime Minister for an answer on whether he would take the knee. He added: ""I don't want people to be bullied into doing things that they don't necessarily want to do at any given moment. ""If you think what happened with those police officers standing at the Cenotaph, they were being insulted in quite aggressive terms by some members of the crowd and being told to take the knee. ""Some of them did and it was very difficult then for the others who didn't.  ""I think it's very important that you don't do things that make life difficult or embarrassing for others."" His comment comes as Dominic Raab sparked backlash after saying he would only ""take a knee"" for the Queen and his wife when asked if he would take part in the symbolic gesture. He was torn apart on Twitter after saying he would only take a knee for the Queen or when proposing to his wife. It comes as the death in Minneapolis of a black man, George Floyd, after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes has sparked protests around the world, with many demonstrators kneeling in streets and squares to protest against racism.

Mayor Naheed Nenshi, alongside health and government officials, has repeatedly stressed the importance of wearing a mask when in a crowded indoor space. However, as more businesses continue their operations, Nenshi noted the need is bigger now than ever to stop a resurgence of the virus so the city can continue to rebuild its economy. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs not mask-wearing or the economy. It├втВмтДвs wearing a mask to save the economy,├втВм┬Э Nenshi said Thursday. A crowd also gathered in Edmonton, where protesters carried signs with slogans disparaging mask use. In a news conference Saturday, Premier Jason Kenney also addressed the anti-mask rallies. He noted that while some residents have their reservations about wearing masks, the alternative outcome of a second wave could have devastating effects on the province. ├втВм┼УMy pitch to those folks, if they├втВмтДвre upset about mask usage, is that that the alternative will inevitably be more widespread suspensions of economic activity if we get a second outbreak,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УI think the responsible exercise of personal freedom through mask usage, where people cannot physically distance, is a lot better than suspending businesses or social activity.├втВм┬Э A protest against making the use of face masks mandatory is underway at the #AbLeg. #YEG pic.twitter.com/8jcYAqL0qS ├втВмтАЭ Chris Chacon (@ChrisAChacon) July 19, 2020  Kenney added that while his government doesn├втВмтДвt want to strong-arm the public into wearing face coverings, he hopes residents will take the threat of the virus seriously. ├втВм┼УAll it takes is the exponential growth of a highly-infectious virus of this nature for it to perspectively come back and overwhelm our health care system,├втВм┬Э Kenney said. ├втВм┼УI would much rather that we prevent that through the widespread use of masks rather than the government big-footing in and suspending the operation of all sorts of businesses that would have massive social and economic consequences.├втВм┬Э But Eskesen is concern about other social consequences. ├втВм┼УThere are so many people out there that have issues with masks for different reasons, one being claustrophobia. People who are claustrophobic can get a lot of anxiety over wearing a mask, same with people with other anxiety issues, people on the spectrum,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УPeople with spectrum disorders can have a lot of issues with masks, not just wearing them but interacting with people who have them on, it makes them uncomfortable a lot of the time.├втВм┬Э Read more: Masks in the mountains: Banff considers mandatory face coverings during COVID-19 pandemic With Calgarians expressing their concerns for mandatory face mask policies at Sunday├втВмтДвs rally, Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, noted that many people├втВмтДвs reservations on the subject stem from ├втВм┼Уconspiracy theories├втВм┬Э and inaccurate information.

6301,"Trump: ├втВм╦ЬIf You Can Protest In Person, You Can Vote In Person├втВмтДв","A Minnesota Representative and trucking company owner is asking federal authorizes to withhold transportation funding if cities continue to allow protests to occur on highways. In a Facebook video, Minnesota Rep. Cal Bahr said that he sent letters to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Gov. Tim Walz, Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner Margaret Anderson Kelliher and Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington requesting they withhold funding transportation if cities continue to allow protests on highways. ├втВм┼УToday I sent a letter to Attorney General Barr and Governor Walz urging them to put an end to allowing protesters to gather on our interstates. In the past few months, we have seen two of our primary interstates blocked by protesters, putting many lives in danger. The lack of penalties for these actions has encouraged others to protest in this same way,├втВм┬Э the Facebook post states. ├втВм┼УI encourage you, your office, along with other federal agencies, to use every tool at your disposal up to and including withholding federal funds if these actions are allowed to continue.├втВм┬Э ├втВмтАЬ Rep. Cal Bahr, the Facebook post states. In his letter, Bahr, a CDL holder and trucking company owner, referenced the May 31st incident that involved a tanker truck encountering protesters on the highway. ├втВм┼УAs someone who has a commercial driver├втВмтДвs license myself, I know firsthand how dangerous this situation is for all concerned. On May 31st, a fuel hauler named Bogdan Virechko was trapped on the I-35W Bridge, blocked by protesters, which MNDOT had failed to secure properly. MNDOT has cameras everywhere along that road, and knowing that they had been unable to restrict traffic in that area, they allowed protesters to block it anyway. ├втВм┼УThe situation could have resulted in many deaths but for the actions of Mr. Virechko, who was beaten by protesters and jailed for his trouble. I don├втВмтДвt need to tell you that allowing situations like this to develop in Minnesota and other states strike at the heart of our interstate commerce system and our rights as citizens to move freely about the country and engage in transactions of all kinds.

6369,Frankie Banali Dead: Quiet Riot Drummer Dies at 68,"NEW YORK (AP) ├втВмтАЭ There is little evidence that the protests that erupted after George Floyd├втВмтДвs death caused a significant increase in U.S. coronavirus infections, according to public health experts. If the protests had driven an explosion in cases, experts say, the jumps would have started to become apparent within two weeks ├втВмтАЭ and perhaps as early as five days. But that didn├втВмтДвt happen in many cities with the largest protests, including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. In what├втВмтДвs considered the first systematic look at the question, a team of economists determined that only one of 13 cities involved in the earliest wave of protests after Memorial Day had an increase that would fit the pattern. It was Phoenix, where experts say cases and hospitalizations surged after a decision by Gov. Doug Ducey to end Arizona├втВмтДвs stay-at-home order on May 15 and eased restrictions on businesses. Arizona residents who were cooped up for six weeks flooded Phoenix-area bar districts, ignoring social distancing guidelines. In many cities, the protests actually seemed to lead to a net increase in social distancing, as more people who did not protest decided to stay off the streets, said that study├втВмтДвs lead author, Dhaval Dave of Bentley University. ├втВм┼УThe large-scale protests can impact both the behavior of the protesters and the behavior of the non-protesters,├втВм┬Э said Dave. The paper was released last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, but has not been published by a peer-reviewed journal. Drawing from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, The Associated Press reviewed trends in daily reported cases in 22 U.S. cities with protests. It found post-protest increases in several cities ├втВмтАЭ including Houston and Madison, Wisconsin ├втВмтАЭ where experts say other factors were more likely the main drivers. Health officials are still investigating case surges in different states, and more data may come in. But experts believe that if the protests did have a big impact on cases, stronger signs would be apparent now. Floyd was killed on May 25 by a Minneapolis police officer who used his knee to pin Floyd├втВмтДвs neck to the ground. The killing of a Black man at the hands of a white officer touched off protests around the United States. Coincidentally, some states had begun to lift social distancing restrictions in late May. Dave and his colleagues counted protests over three weeks in 281 cities with populations of at least 100,000. Most had protests lasting more than three days, and many had protests that had at least 1,000 participants. It's not clear how many protesters participated, let alone how many of them wore masks or got tested after. That may have varied from place to place. Houston is among a number of Texas cities that have recently seen steep increases in cases and hospitalizations. Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the county health department, believes it was likely some cases could be traced to the protests. ""We just don't know how much,├втВм┬Э he said. But it's hard to measure the protests' precise impact for a number of reasons, Shah and others said. Earlier business reopenings and more willingness to shrug off social distancing guidelines started the trend in the Houston area, Shah said. Another factor: Many people don't get tested unless they feel symptoms. Many protesters were young adults, who generally are less likely to get severe illness, and therefore may not have gotten tested, experts said. And some who do get tested may still not answer all the questions they are asked by outbreak investigators. ├втВм┼УI know of three people who told us ├втВм╦ЬYes, I was at a protest.├втВмтДв That doesn't mean there was not another 25 or more who did attend a protest and just did not share that with us,"" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, the public health commissioner for the city of Columbus, Ohio. That city has seen increased cases in the last month, but health officials say they can't attribute it to any particular reason other than people socializing and returning to normal activities without wearing masks or taking other precautions. So far, protests don't seem to be a real factor. ├втВм┼УMost of the protests, at least in my jurisdiction, were outside,├втВм┬Э and the virus does not spread as well outside, Roberts said. ""And I would say 50% of those at the protests were wearing a face mask."" ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute├втВмтДвs Department of Science Education.

In November 2019, Banali opened up about his diagnosis. He said his decision to keep performing live stemmed from the fact that he had ├втВм┼Уeverything to win and everything to lose in this situation. I intend to treat it the way I treat everything, which is to put everything into it and fight it all of the way to the end.├втВм┬Э Regina shared some of Banali├втВмтДвs biggest career moments as a musician in her statement.

He spent about a year in New Steppenwolf, which was an offshoot of the hard-rock legends led by their former bassist Nick St. Nicholas. In 1979, Banali left to begin working with singer Kevin DuBrow, whose band, Quiet Riot, had broken up after guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Rudy Sarzo left to play with Ozzy Osbourne, according to ultimateclassicrock.com. The prolific drummer is survived by his daughter, Ashley, whose mother was Banali├втВмтДвs first wife Karen, who died in 2009. Banali is also survived by his second wife, Regina, who directed him in the 2015 documentary Quiet Riot: Well Now You├втВмтДвre Here, There├втВмтДвs No Way Back.

Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by Kenosha Police Department officers in front of his children on August 23 following a domestic violence call. Kenosha police officers were responding to a domestic incident near 28th Avenue and 40th Street around 5:11 p.m, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Attorney General. Jacob was trying to break up a fight between two women when he was tased and then shot by police, The Kenosha News reported. In a graphic video posted on social media, two officers are seen following Jacob to a gray van with their weapons drawn. As Jacob enters the vehicle, one of the officers is seen grabbing and pulling on Jacob├втВмтДвs shirt and shoots multiple shots into his back. A woman in the video is seen frantically screaming and jumping up and down following the shooting. The 29-year-old was sent to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition, according to The Kenosha News. NBA Agent and Jacob├втВмтДвs childhood friend, Daniel Poneman, wrote on Twitter that Jacob was out of surgery and currently in the ICU fighting for his life. ├втВм┼УHe is out of surgery and in the ICU.

Following the shooting, demonstrators gathered outside the scene of the shooting to protest, WDJT-TV reported. The city of Kenosha issued a city-wide curfew until 7 a.m. on August 24 because of the protests. ""It goes back to the Emmett Tills. We're tired of it. Rodney King. We're tired of it. And right now, this is the wrong generation that this is happening to. The frustration is boiling to the top and we're sick and tired,"" said Clyde McLemore, founder of Black Lives Matter of Lake County, Illinois, told the news station. The shooting comes just days after the fatal police shooting of Trayford Pellerin in Louisiana and anti-racism protests following multiple police-involved deaths. Who is Jacob? Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Jacob and his family, posted on Twitter that he is a father whose three sons witnessed the shooting while sitting in the backseat of the vehicle Jacob was trying to enter. ├втВм┼УJacob Blake├втВмтДвs 3 SONS were IN THE CAR he was getting into when @KenoshaPolice shot him tonight.

Text to Speech CNN -- the network where Brian Stelter preaches that the Republicans and Fox News are guilty of ""asymmetric lying"" -- was dramatically bending reality in the 5 am hour on Tuesday.

Before turning to Jimenez, co-host Laura ""daughter of Valerie"" Jarrett explained ""There were protests in several other cities yesterday as well, most of them peaceful, although an officer was attacked with a cane in San Diego."" OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Laura, what you're seeing is one of multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the course of the night, a second night since Jacob Blake was seen shot in the back seven times by a police officer. And what you are seeing now, these images came in stark contrast to what we saw over the course of the daytime hours in Kenosha and into the early evening, which were largely peaceful demonstrations in the face of law enforcement. It wasn't until night fall that things begun to get a little bit more contentious. Things were thrown back and forth. Police started using some of those crowd dispersal tactics like tear gas, even playing really loud sounds to push them. And then what you're seeing, a common theme that ties all of this together is an expression of anger and frustration over what people feel really like has become an all too familiar story playing out in places from across the country not just here in Kenosha, Wisconsin -- Christine, Laura. Jimenez is the 26-year-old CNN reporter who was wrongly arrested by police in Minneapolis during the George Floyd-spurred rioting. CNN then turned that mistake into an ad about their own heroic riot coverage. As Tristan Justice at The Federalist noted, Jimenez was also the reporter on scene on Monday's Situation Room where the CNN chyron was briefly accurate -- ├втВм┼У8PM Curfew Ordered After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsin├втВм┬Э -- until they nixed the V-word after a few seconds.

KENOSHA, Wis. - Three vehicles, a black school bus, bread truck and tan minivan were stopped by Kenosha police Wednesday evening, Aug. 26 after police said officers suspected the occupants ""were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest."" This, on the fourth night of protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, and a night after two people were fatally shot during demonstrations. Police said this began with a citizen tip that the vehicles planned to meet in a remote lot near State Highway 50 and Green Bay Road. Officers began surveilling the vehicles after locating them, assisted by U.S. Marshals -- and confirmed the out-of-state plates. Police said officers followed them to a gas station near Washington Road and 30th Avenue, where officers observed the occupants of the bus and bread truck exit and attempt to fill multiple fuel cans. Credit: Jenna Sykora At this point, ""suspecting that the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest,"" officers attempted to make contact and investigate. Police noted, ""the officers exited their vehicles, identified themselves, were wearing appropriate identification and then detained the occupants of the bus and bread truck."" The driver of the minivan tried to pull away, but the vehicle was stopped and police forced entry -- arresting the occupants. According to police, the vehicles contained various items that included helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks and suspected controlled substances. The nine individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct and are pending charging decisions by the Kenosha County district attorney. ├втВм┼УJacob did nothing to provoke police. He was a great father and was only intending to get his children out of a volatile situation. Witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didn├втВмтДвt threaten officers in any way,"" Benjamin Crump said in a statement Thursday on the shooting of Jacob Blake by Kenosha police. Investigators haven├втВмтДвt explained why police drew guns on Blake and why the officer opened fire. They say a knife was found in the SUV, but they have said nothing about what role it may have played.

Late Saturday into Sunday morning, police said people who identified themselves as ├втВм┼Уpress├втВм┬Э threw objects at police.

6899,Police Reportedly Committed 125 Human Rights Violations During BLM Protests,"A Florida teacher responded to her district├втВмтДвs plans to reopen for in-person classes during the coronavirus pandemic by writing her own obituary. Whitney Reddick, who teaches special education in Jacksonville, Florida, posted the mock death notice to Facebook Aug. 4. In it, she proclaims that she died ├втВм┼Уwhile alone in isolation and on a ventilator at a Duval county hospital├втВм┬Э last week at age 33. ├втВм┼УEven though she shouted from the rooftops, attempted to be unemotional, and educated herself in facts and science, she succumbed to the ignorance of those in power,├втВм┬Э the obituary reads. ├втВм┼УShe returned to work, did her best to handle all the roles placed on her shoulders; educator, COVID-security guard, human shield, firefighter, social worker, nurse, and caregiver but the workload weakened her, and the virus took hold.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УWhitney was taken from us,├втВм┬Э it continues. ├втВм┼УYes, of course too soon, but we are the ones left with holes in our hearts, missing how big hers was.├втВм┬Э Mourners are then encouraged to send ├втВм┼Уcondolences├втВм┬Э to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) and the Duval County school board and superintendent. According to its website, Duval County public schools are slated to reopen next Thursday with both in-person and remote learning options for students. Though Reddick said in an interview she├втВмтДвll return to her classroom as scheduled, she added that she├втВмтДвd prefer her district keep classes for all students remote, given that coronavirus cases in Florida continue to surge. ├втВм┼УI felt the gravity of the situation and the obit took that on,├втВм┬Э she told ├втВм┼УThe Today Show├втВм┬Э last week. She said that in the debate over reopening schools, educators ├втВм┼Уno longer became people who had families and loved ones, we became a tool in restarting an economy. I wanted it to hit home that teachers are people and have families and loved ones.├втВм┬Э And Reddick, the mother of a 1-year-old boy, said she├втВмтДвs mostly concerned about what would happen to her family if she were to contract COVID-19. ├втВм┼УI love my job so much,├втВм┬Э she told CBS Jacksonville. ├втВм┼УWhat if I go on a ventilator? What if my husband gets sick? ... Who takes care of our son? What if I pass away? What if he passes away?├втВм┬Э In an email, Duval County Superintendent Diana Greene told HuffPost she and her staff planned to ├втВм┼Уrise to the challenge├втВм┬Э of teaching amid the pandemic. ├втВм┼УTeaching is a public service, but it is unlikely any of us thought about a long-term global pandemic when we chose this path to serve children,├втВм┬Э she said. ├втВм┼УI empathize with the fears some teachers have expressed, and I also empathize with the needs of 130,000 children and their families.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УWith the resources and guidance available to us, we must move forward with every feasible precaution to support our employees and to serve those students who need us in classrooms,├втВм┬Э she added.

6915,Trump furious that he can't do rallies in Florida after its GOP governor made COVID spread 'worse': report,"By Ariel Zilber and Rachel Sharp For Dailymail.com and Associated Press Published: 08:48 EDT, 29 August 2020 | Updated: 12:00 EDT, 29 August 2020  1.1k View comments  One of the two protesters fatally shot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night by a 17-year-old vigilante gunman from Illinois was filmed taunting a group of armed individuals moments before he was killed. ├втВм╦ЬShoot me, n*****,├втВмтДв 36-year-old Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men during the unrest that followed last Sunday's police shooting of 29-year-old black man Jacob Blake. One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum. He then walks past Rosenbaum without incident. Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, has been charged with fatally shooting Rosenbaum and 26-year-old Anthony Huber and wounding a third - Gaige Grosskreutz, 26. Rittenhouse shot one of his victims five times including in the head, the criminal complaint reveals - but his attorney has claimed it was he who was 'attacked' and insisted he was acting in self-defense. Rittenhouse's attorney Lin Wood said the 17-year-old vigilante was 'attacked' with 'lethal force' and 'had the right to defend himself' when he shot dead the two Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man, Grosskreutz. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, one of two people killed during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, was filmed shortly before his death taunting a group of armed individuals. Rosenbaum is seen on the right in the reddish-brown t-shirt ├втВм╦ЬShoot me, n*****,├втВмтДв the 36-year-old Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap (left) and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum Attorneys representing Rittenhouse have said he acted to defend himself. Kenosha County prosecutors said in court records this week that Rosenbaum was the first person Rittenhouse shot at around 11:45pm on Tuesday. Prosecutors said Rosenbaum followed Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him. The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin, back and left hand. The wounds fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead. The two men who were killed were Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, (left) and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, (right) about 15 miles west of the city. Huber's devastated girlfriend broke her silence over his 'murder' Friday, saying her 'heroic' boyfriend died trying to save the lives of her and other protesters Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, pictured with his fianc├Г┬йe and a young daughter, died Tuesday evening Gaige Grosskreutz (left) - the suspected killer's third and only surviving victim is pictured in hospital recovering after the shooting. On right is his left arm where he was shot Grosskreutz pictured clutching his bloodied arm after Rittenhouse shot him at close range Tuesday night Grosskreutz getting medical attention after the shooting. Grosskreutz, aged 26, was legally permitted to be carrying his handgun. Rittenhouse meanwhile is 17 and so was illegally carrying the AR-15 rifle he used to shoot Grosskreutz and the two other victims Friends have told local media that Rosenbaum was originally from Texas and previously lived in Arizona before moving to Wisconsin this year, where his young daughter lives. According to his Facebook page, he worked at a Wendy's restaurant in Kenosha. Rosenbaum is survived by a fiancee and a young daughter. ├втВм╦ЬMay you forever be with the angels and rest easy bro. I love you!├втВмтДв his sister wrote on Facebook. After shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone, before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and video footage. Huber, of Silver Lake, Wisconsin, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrestle the gun away from Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Hannah Gittings, Huber's girlfriend, told WBBM-TV that he pushed her out of the way before chasing after the man others on the street had identified as the shooter. Huber├втВмтДвs friends gathered at a Kenosha skate park this week to remember him and his passion for skateboarding. According to court records, Huber had a skateboard in his right hand and used it to ├втВм╦Ьmake contact├втВмтДв with Rittenhouse├втВмтДвs left shoulder as they struggled for control of the gun. Other protesters remembered Huber on Wednesday night near the spot where he was shot, and Gittings told the group that he was an amazing person. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, has been charged with first degree intentional homicide following the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha on Tuesday. Social media photos show the teen had a strong admiration for law enforcement and guns Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter - the movement that supports police. He also previously participated in a youth public safety cadet program (pictured), according to social media ├втВм╦ЬHe took down an armed gunman with nothing but his (profanity) skateboard,├втВмтДв Gittings said, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Kenosha News reported that local protest organizers said both Rosenbaum and Huber had participated in demonstrations this spring and summer, beginning with the May death of George Floyd after a Minnesota police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed man's neck. ├втВм╦ЬThey came out here every time with us,├втВмтДв said Porche Bennett, a Kenosha resident who has organized protests. ├втВм╦ЬSweet. Loving. They were the sweetest hearts, souls. I called Anthony my hippie guy. They were sweet guys.├втВмтДв Bennett said she was particularly grateful to Huber, who stood in front of her when authorities used tear gas during protests outside the Kenosha County Courthouse this week. According to court records, Huber has a criminal record that includes several arrests for battery, drugs and other charges. At the time of his death, Rosenbaum had an open criminal case on battery, disorderly conduct and domestic abuse charges. The third man to be shot was wounded in the left arm. Court records said Grosskreutz appeared to be holding a gun when he approached Rittenhouse after he shot at Huber. Grosskreutz is an activist who volunteered as a medic during the Kenosha demonstrations, according to Milwaukee activist Bethany Crevensten. Jacob Blake (pictured) was shot seven times in the back by a cop in front of his three young children Sunday. Outrage is building over the cops' response to white teen Rittenhouse compared to black man Blake The image above shows the moment a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer fired at least seven shots into the back of Jacob Blake as he was getting into an SUV in a residential neighborhood The images above show the moments leading up to the shooting. Blake (seen in the white shirt) walks away from a police officer who has his gun drawn She said Grosskreutz was part of a group of roughly two dozen activists who have demonstrated around Milwaukee in the wake of Floyd├втВмтДвs death and went to Kenosha to protest. Grosskreutz, who was wearing a backpack and cap labeled ├втВм╦Ьparamedic,├втВмтДв was shot in the arm, Crevensten said. ├втВм╦ЬHe was a hero and he is a hero,├втВмтДв she said. Grosskreutz, of West Allis, was recovering after surgery and was not yet giving interviews, Crevensten said this week. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Grosskreutz is a senior at Northland College in Ashland and the college registrar's office said he is set to graduate in December. Kyle Rittenhouse's (pictured Tuesday night) attorney has claimed he was 'attacked' and was acting in self-defense when he shot dead two unarmed Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man in the streets of Kenosha Tuesday night, as new video reveals a different angle to one of the attacks The video shows the vigilante shooting his third and only surviving victim Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm as the 26-year-old was carrying a handgun. This came moments after Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, and called a friend to say 'I've killed someone' Grosskreutz is armed with a handgun in his right hand and appears to come towards Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse opens fire at Grosskreutz at close range shooting him in the left arm. Wisconsin is an open carry state, meaning people aged 18 and over are legally allowed to carry a gun. Grosskreutz is over 18, Rittenhouse is not A grab of Rittenhouse's extradition hearing on Friday morning. He did not show his face The paper also reported that he previously worked as a special events coordinator, wilderness medical instructor and sea kayak guide at Lost Creek Adventures in Cornucopia, according to an online LinkedIn profile. The company offers kayak tours, rentals and programs on wilderness skills within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Rittenhouse, a police-obsessed Donald Trump supporter, appeared before a judge briefly on a Zoom call on Friday. His extradition hearing has been pushed back another month. He will return to court on September 25. The teen is faced with murder charges while outrage builds nationwide over the different treatment by cops of the white armed teen compared to their treatment of Blake. Rittenhouse faces five felony charges that include first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, and a misdemeanor charge for possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.

Our editorial content is not influenced by any commissions we receive. ├В┬й Complex Media, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Complex.com is a part of Find him on Twitter. Share This Story Amnesty International is urging law enforcement to reform its policing policies, after identifying 125 human rights violations during the Black Lives Matter protests. On Tuesday, the organization released a report in which it documented alleged abuses committed by federal, state, and local police officers between May 26 and June 5 across 40 states. After analyzing police responses to the demonstrations sparked by George Floyd's death, Amnesty concluded that law enforcement had violated people's rights to peaceful assembly through the use of intimidation and violence. The organization specifically noted the use of tear gas, smoke, and percussion grenades, which were not only used against protestors, but also bystanders and journalists. Per the report: Using heavy-duty riot gear and military-grade weapons and equipment to police largely peaceful demonstrations intimidates protesters exercising their right to peaceful assembly. Equipping officers in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable rather than possible and may escalate tensions between protesters and police ... As seen in many countries, inappropriate or excessive police interventions can actually lead to violence and disorder rather than reducing tensions. Indeed, police will have a propensity to use the weaponry they are deployed with and so should not be deployed with weapons that are inherently inappropriate for the operation they are conducting. Amnesty also launched an interactive map that marked instances of police violence during the demonstrations. The map was a result of an extensive investigation that included the analysis of 500 videos and photos posted on social media as well as consultation with weapons and law enforcement experts. In some of these cases, Amnesty was able to interview the victims and confirm police conduct with local authorities. Related Stories STORY CONTINUES BELOW ""The analysis is clear: When activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets in cities and towns across the USA to peacefully demand an end to systemic racism and police violence, they were overwhelmingly met with a militarized response and more police violence,"" said Brian Castner, senior crisis advisor on Arms and Military Operations at Amnesty International. ""The time for applying band-aids and making excuses for a few ├втВм╦Ьbad apples├втВмтДв has passed."" Amnesty is calling on federal, state, and local officials to make sweeping changes to the way law enforcement responds to protests. The organization has urged lawmakers to limit the use of lethal force and ""ensure that everyone under their jurisdiction can enjoy their human rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression."" Amnesty has also demanded each law enforcement agency to revise the policing policies in accordance with international human rights standards, including those laid out in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials. ""What├втВмтДвs needed now is systemic, root-and-branch reform of US policing that brings an end to the scourge of police use of excessive force and extrajudicial executions of Black people,"" Castner said. ""Communities should not live in fear of being harmed by the very officers that have sworn an oath to protect them. Officers responsible for excessive force and unlawful killings must always be held accountable."" Join the conversation on Complex today! Share This Story",1,3,0,0
6961,Thousands of people protest after Lukashenko landslide win in Belarus election,"President Donald Trump is reportedly furious at one of his allies for taking his advice. According to Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman, the president is angry that he can't hold any of his trademark campaign rallies in Florida amid its weeks-long surge in COVID-19 cases. What's more, Sherman's sources say Trump is putting the blame for this predicament at the feet of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been eager to follow the president's commands to reopen state economies even as the country records more than 50,000 infections and 1,000 new deaths from the novel coronavirus every day. ""He thinks Ron has made it a lot worse,"" one Republican who spoke with Trump said. Trump was forced to cancel his planned RNC acceptance speech in Jacksonville after public health officials told him there was no way to safely hold a mass gathering in the city without risking mass COVID-19 infection. Nonetheless, one aide tells Sherman that ""rallies are his jam"" and that ""Trump won├втВмтДвt be happy until he is doing multiple rallies a day."" The novel coronavirus crisis in Florida continues to grow more and more dire. As flagged by Bloomberg News' Steven Dennis, Florida has once again smashed its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations and now has 15,169 residents hospitalized with the disease. Even more alarming is the fact that nearly 47 percent of all intensive care unit beds in the state are being taken up by COVID-19 patients, which Dennis says is the highest percentage in the nation right now. The latest numbers mark a major jump from just two days ago, when Florida reported having 13,793 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has so far completely refused to enact any measures that could possibly slow down the spread of the disease and has even threatened to withhold pay from school administrators who want to implement mask mandates for students and faculty. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has similarly banned school districts from enforcing mask or vaccination requirements, is now asking hospitals to postpone all elective surgeries while he looks for out-of-state health workers who can help his state cope with the deadly pandemic. Earth has warmed 1.09├втАЮ╞Т since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report also found escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth, and every facet of the weather. The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November. The IPCC is the peak climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. It is the global authority on the state of Earth's climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment. Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today. But there is still time to avert the worst damage, if humanity chooses to.  For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally ├втВмтАЭ leaving absolutely no room for doubt ├втВмтАЬ humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans. The IPCC finds Earth's global surface temperature warmed 1.09├втАЮ╞Т between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29├втАЮ╞Т warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1├втАЮ╞Т of the increase is due to data improvements.) Read more: Monday's IPCC report is a really big deal for climate change. So what is it? And why should we trust it? Trump-loving podcaster and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Tuesday said that America's founders would have launched a military strike against ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" events if such things existed in the late 18th century. In his podcast, Kirk sought to dispel what he called ""lies"" about America's founders and their tolerance for what Kirk considers to be sexual deviancy. ""One of the lies about the founding fathers is that they were strictly small-l libertarians,"" he said. ""And that's just not true... For example, let me just tell you this: If Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, or John Adams saw drag queen story hour, they would mobilize the Minutemen."" It is unclear what about transgender people reading stories to children would require a military response, but Kirk insisted that such an attack would have been within the framers' conception of human liberty.

6972,Thousands protest against coronavirus measures in Berlin,"Demonstrators set a Portland, Oregon, police precinct on fire Sunday evening as the event was declared a riot by the law enforcement agency. On Monday morning, the Portland Police Department released a statement along with footage of the unrest that erupted several hours prior. According to the police department├втВмтДвs statement, a crowd of approximately 200 protesters gathered in the streets of Portland late Sunday evening at around 9:41 p.m. Shortly after the gathering began, it intensified to protests, and ├втВм┼Уsomeone lit a canopy against the building on fire.├втВм┬Э The law enforcement agency detailed how the fire erupted. ├втВм┼УThe fire began to burn to the siding of the building, so officers on the roof got a fire extinguisher to try and put it out. As they were putting out the fire, multiple people pelted the officers with rocks,├втВм┬Э the statement read. ├втВм┼УA lieutenant was struck with a chunk of ceramic, causing a cut to his hand. A second awning was also lit on fire close to a tree. That caused damage before it was extinguished.├втВм┬Э  Amid the precinct fire, the police department detailed a number of other incidents that occurred on Sunday evening. According to the department, the majority of participants wore ├втВм┼Уarmor, helmets, gas masks, all-black clothing, and carried shields.├втВм┬Э The statement also indicated that the riot began when a dumpster was set on fire and pushed into an intersection. Law enforcement officials also claim the burning dumpster was used to shield to protect rioters as they hurled multiple objects at officers including: ├втВм┼УAlmost immediately, from behind the shields and elsewhere, individuals began throwing chunks of ceramic, rocks, and glass bottles in the direction of the officers. Green lasers, which are capable of causing permanent eye damage, were shined at officers. At least one balloon filled with feces was thrown at officers on the roof of the building.├втВм┬Э At one point, a commercial-grade firework, paint bombs, rocks and even ├втВм┼Уmarbles were launched by at least one wrist rocket style slingshot,├втВм┬Э according to the police department. As a result of the fire, ├втВм┼УTwo North Precinct awnings were lit on fire, and officers were targeted by protesters with sharp chunks of ceramic, rocks, mortars, and powerful lasers during a riot Sunday evening into Monday morning.├втВм┬Э We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

7033,"Thousands protest in Mauritius over dead dolphins, demand resignations","Authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko has won another term - but there are concerns that the election was not run fairly. Monday 10 August 2020 10:24, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Police and protesters have clashed in the capital of Belarus and other cities after a contested presidential election which saw the country's long-time leader secure a landslide victory. Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, won the election with 80% of the vote, the election commission said - according to preliminary results. However, there is widespread suspicion that the election was not fair, with two opposition candidates denied places on the ballot before one of them was jailed and the other fled to Russia.  On Monday morning Reuters reported that at least one person was killed and 120 protesters had been detained, citing the Viasna human rights group. Many were injured in clashes with riot police who were deployed on the streets to disperse protesters. ""It was a peaceful protest, we weren't using force,"" said 23-year-old protester Pavel Konoplyanik, helping a friend to hospital who had a plastic grenade fragment stuck in his neck. ""No one will believe in the official results of the vote, they have stolen our victory."" The main opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was targeted during the weekend: eight members of her staff were arrested and one of her aides fled the country. Ms Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher and wife of a jailed opposition blogger, had received large displays of support leading up to the election - unusual in a country where dissent is rarely tolerated. But opposition supporters said they expected election officials would manipulate the election results in favour of Mr Lukashenko. After the vote on Sunday, thousands of protesters gathered in Minsk where police used truncheons to beat them and flash-bang grenades in an effort to get them to leave. Protesters tried to build barricades with rubbish bins. There were also demonstrations in the cities of Brest, Gomel, Grodno and Vitebsk and police fired tear gas at people in Brest, according to news reports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is unclear how many people were injured or arrested but the Association Press quoted Ales Bilyatsky of Viasna as saying there had been several hundred arrests. Among them were three journalists from an independent Russian TV station and an AP journalist was beaten by police and taken to hospital. But for some voters, Lukashenko's long, hard-line rule was a plus. ""He is an experienced politician, not a housewife who appeared out of nowhere and muddied the waters,"" said retiree Igor Rozhov. ""We need a strong hand that will not allow riots."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, Ms Tsikhanouskaya said she did not believe the polls, saying: ""I will believe with my own eyes. The majority was for us."" After voting earlier in the day, she had said: ""I hope that everything will be peaceful and that the police will not use force."" As he voted, Mr Lukashenko had said: ""Do you want to try to overthrow the government, break something, wound, offend, and expect me or someone to kneel in front of you and kiss them and the sand onto which you wandered? This will not happen."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mr Lukashenko has been in power since July 1994 but many have become frustrated with his authoritarian rule, the struggling economy and his failure to recognise the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. He has dismissed the illness as ""psychosis"" and advised people to ""drink vodka"" and ""go to saunas"" to ward off the virus. Two weeks ago, the 65-year-old said he had caught COVID-19 and recovered ""on his feet"" without showing any symptoms.  He has not brought in any restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, despite more than 68,500 confirmed cases and 580 deaths - numbers that critics say are manipulated. Ms Tsikhanouskaya tapped into this frustration as she campaigned across the former Soviet country of 9.5 million people.

7040,Georgia grad students and faculty hold 'die in' demonstration to protest reopening,"In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals ├втВмтАЬ all in one place.      Demonstrators ignore hygiene rules to rally in German capital. Thousands of people, packed close together and not wearing face masks, protested in Berlin on Saturday against official measures intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Police said they would file charges against the organizer of the gathering as demonstrators had not followed hygiene rules such as maintaining social distancing or wearing a mask covering nose and mouth. Some 17,000 people took part in the demonstration at its peak, according to police. The gathering was organized with the title ""The end of the pandemic ├втВмтАЭ day of freedom."" Some demonstrators chanted ""the biggest conspiracy theory is the pandemic,"" according to German media reports. A Stuttgart-based organization called Querdenken 711 ├втВмтАЭ which roughly translates as ""thinking outside the box 711"" ├втВмтАЭ organized the rally. The interior minister for the city of Berlin, Andreas Geisel, said on Friday that neo-Nazi organizations had also called for people to participate in the march. German media outlets noted that ""Day of Freedom"" was also the name of a Nazi propaganda film documenting the party's 1935 party congress in Nuremberg. One banner at the march called for politicians such as German Health Minister Jens Spahn, Bavaria's state premier Markus S├Г┬╢der, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leading virologist Christian Drosten to be ""locked away."" Protesters also ""aggressively asked"" journalists to remove their masks by protestors, newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported. A video by Querdenken 711 before the march said the group was peaceful and called on attendees to be polite to journalists. Sawsan Chebli, a senior official in the Berlin city government, called the protest ""a disaster."" ""I just came from abroad and see these pictures. Many look to Germany, and admire us for how we have dealt with corona. Such pictures are a disaster. They destroy everything. They endanger human lives and destroy livelihoods. They scare me,"" she tweeted. ├втВм╦ЬI don├втВмтДвt want to do without it,├втВмтДв the German ex-chancellor said about the popular sausage dish.

7083,Joe Biden Supporters Protest Jo Jorgensen Rally,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Giulia Paravicini 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in the Mauritius capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into an oil spill from a Japanese ship and the mysterious death of at least 40 dolphins that have been found near the site of the spill. Environmentalists have called for an investigation into whether the dolphins died as a result of the spill caused when the bulk carrier, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. One protestor held a banner with a dolphin covered in oil reading ├втВм┼Уour lives matter├втВм┬Э and another held one calling for the government to resign. Mauritian flags were waved across the packed square of St Louis Cathedral. ├втВм┼УWe do not trust the government and the diluted information they├втВмтДвve been feeding us regarding the management and responses to the oil spill,├втВм┬Э Fabiola Monty, 33 a Mauritian environmental scientist, told Reuters from the square. The government has said it will carry out autopsies on all the dead dolphins and has set up a commission to look into the oil spill. Two investigations are being carried out: one by the police on the crew├втВмтДвs responsibilities and one by a senior Shipping Ministry official on what happened to the ship. So far veterinarians have examined only two of the mammals├втВмтДв carcasses, which bore signs of injury but no trace of oil in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, according to Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry. Local environmental group Eco-Sud, which took part in Saturday├втВмтДвs protest, said in a statement on Friday that representatives from civil society should be present during the autopsies and called for a second opinion from independent specialists.

Older adults are typically more prone to severe coronavirus infections, although individuals with weakened immune systems are also at high risk. The demonstrators have a list of demands corresponding to the protest, including petitions for more COVID-19 testing and offering faculty members the liberty to teach remotely. Currently, faculty must seek permission from the school to teach remote online courses. The group submitted a petition with 1,002 signatures along with the list of demands to an employee in the administration building. Graduate student Bryant Barnes said the school's current testing plans would not be enough to accommodate consistently testing all students and employees. Sujata Iyengar, a professor at the school since 1998 who joined protesters, said she thinks university officials ""have not thought this through,"" adding that more classes should be held outside rather than indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. ""We have affirmatively addressed the core of these concerns through our comprehensive planning over the summer,"" the school said in the statement, adding that the university has committed $250,000 for emergency funds to aid students who have critical and sudden financial emergencies.

7162,Thousands join pro-democracy protest in Thailand,"PROTESTS NOT ALLOWED: The Chicago Police Department has banned protests near Mayor Lori Lightfoot├втВмтДвs home. REASON: In July protesters rallied near the Mayor├втВмтДвs residence and due to threats she reportedly receives daily, heightened security was put in place. WHY IT├втВмтДвS HYPOCRITICAL: Protests have been allowed to dominate business and residential areas since May. Vandalism of property, arson, blockades, looting, violence, and organized acts of terrorism have all been watched by certain Democrat officials. Often supported without condemnation. Now that the wildfires of anarchy are seemingly uncontrollable, officials that could have and should have stopped it earlier are protected. Yet businesses, properties, and people├втВмтДвs daily lives continue to suffer. BANNED: What├втВмтДвs most hypocritical is that according to a report, not even peaceful protests are allowed near the Mayor├втВмтДвs home. CHECK OUT: Watch the Portland Mayor protected by private security after the anarchists he stood with surge and get aggressive. Back in July, a report surfaced saying that the police had banned protests from the Logan Square neighborhood, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot lives. It referred to a directive from Melvin Roman, the Shakespeare District Commander, written to officers under his command. It stated that once the order to move was given by police officers, any protesters who remained should be arrested. The directive did not differentiate between peaceful or violent protests. The Mayor should just put signs up saying ├втВм┼УProtests Not Allowed.├втВм┬Э CHECK OUT: Mayor on the hunt for criminal mastermind who wrote hate speech on a road sign. The sign read ├втВм┼УAll Lives Matter.├втВм┬Э Both the Mayor and Police Chief apologized for the act. Some might say that this move by the Mayor and Chicago Police Department is against the First Amendment, it isn├втВмтДвt. It only seems that way because of the chaos, violence, and ignorance shown by some elected officials. By law, officials can define times and places protests take place. If done so neutrally and reasonably. However, the keyword is peaceful. A violent protest is not legal. CHECK OUT: Child shot by anarchists, at an anarchist barrier that a Mayor was negotiating over. Subscribe: Apple / Google / Spotify / Stitcher / RSS Mayor Lori Lightfoot said: ├втВм┼УI think that residents of this city, understanding the nature of the threats that we are receiving on a daily basis, on a daily basis, understand I have a right to make sure that my home is secure.├втВм┬Э If only every resident of Chicago could use taxpayer├втВмтДвs money to make sure their homes, businesses, and property were secure. She continued: ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm not going to make any excuses for the fact that, given the threats I have personally received, given the threats to my home and my family, I├втВмтДвm going to do everything I can to make sure they├втВмтДвre protected. I make no apologies whatsoever for that.├втВм┬Э Remember, this is the Mayor who while the rest of Chicago was in lockdown, was out getting her hair done. It is pure hypocrisy.

Mr. Wheeler took some of the blame himself, saying he and other leaders have allowed the city├втВмтДвs reputation for protest to be hijacked by rioters bent on violence, swamping what should have been a thoughtful conversation on racial justice and policing. ├втВм┼УThey├втВмтДвre intent on creating mayhem and attacking and harming people, not just property,├втВм┬Э the mayor said in an online press conference Wednesday night. ├втВм┼УThat├втВмтДвs a line that we can├втВмтДвt allow our community to cross. Not anymore. Enough is enough.├втВм┬Э TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestreamNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill The mayor is the latest figure on the left to condemn rioting that has started to dominate the racial justice conversation sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The final straw appears to have been when rioters brought their violence to his doorstep. After weeks of smashing windows and lighting small fires at police buildings, the federal courthouse and other public offices, protesters marched on Portland├втВмтДвs city hall Tuesday night, breaking in and scrawling graffiti. Hours later, Mr. Wheeler said it was time to put an end to that side of things. ├втВм┼УPulling people from their vehicles and beating them in the streets is a horrific, violent crime,├втВм┬Э he said, describing an assault caught on video from earlier this month, for which a protester has been arrested. Mr. Wheeler, who also serves as police commissioner, rejected demands for a $50 million cut to the police budget as a first step to assuage protesters. He said his goal is to rethink policing and to have the broadest conversation possible. He said he├втВмтДвs been trying to get a sense for the myriad sets of demands from those who are protesting ├втВмтАЭ most of whom are peacefully marching, but several hundred of whom nightly pick targets for mayhem. ├втВм┼УI had a meeting last week where a group of people frankly just shouted expletives at me. That was how they wanted to use their time. I had to end it a little early because my daughter was in the room,├втВм┬Э Mr. Wheeler said. Mr. Trump this week renewed his call for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown to request him to deploy the National Guard. Ms. Brown, on Twitter, said the state├втВмтДвs National Guard is fighting forest fires and said Mr. Trump could better use his time trying to assist the state in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. ├втВм┼УOregon isn├втВмтДвt interested in a role in your political theater,├втВм┬Э she told the president. But Ms. Brown, a Democrat, also signaled that she, too, is worried that the protests are beginning to stain Portland and the racial justice debate. ├втВм┼УLet me be clear: It├втВмтДвs time for the violence and vandalism to end so Portland can focus on the important work to be done to achieve real change for racial justice. Those who have committed acts of violence will be held accountable,├втВм┬Э she said. Wednesday night, after Mr. Wheeler held his press conference, was the first night this week that police did not declare a riot. That doesn├втВмтДвt mean things were calm. Demonstrators marched on the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, disabling security cameras, vandalizing the building and pelting federal police with bottles and fist-sized rocks. Demonstrators also tried to blind the officers with lasers. About 200 people were involved, the Portland Police Bureau said. Seeing the violence, the local officers moved in, declaring the gathering an unlawful assembly ├втВмтАЭ a level below a riot ├втВмтАЭ and pushing the crowd away. The Portland officers said they, too, were pelted with rocks. After they├втВмтДвd pushed the crowd away from the ICE building, they disengaged, and the protesters started back toward ICE. Portland police say they moved in to make targeted arrests. One protester used pepper spray on police, and a fire was ignited, police said. Local police made 11 arrests, including charging one 26-year-old with unlawful use of pepper spray.  Copyright ├В┬й 2021 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

7313,"Seattle closes park ahead of Christian prayer rally, so supporters hold 'worship protest' outside instead","Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, cost the city an estimated $2 million to city property alone, according to one city official who believes, by the end of an ongoing assessment, the cost will be much higher. ├втВм┼УThe city├втВмтДвs public works director, Shelly Billingsley, provided the estimate to local leaders Monday night on what it would cost to replace garbage trucks, street lights, and traffic signals, among other things that were destroyed or damaged in the unrest over the last week,├втВм┬Э ABC News reported Tuesday. The city is insured, but as Minneapolis, Minnesota, residents are now finding out, insurance coverage for riot damage is limited, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, where ├втВм┼Уdozens├втВм┬Э of business owners are now finding out that demolition costs, particularly, won├втВмтДвt be reimbursed in full. The damage to city services may also hinder Kenosha├втВмтДвs public works department in the long term. According to Billingsley, the garbage and utility trucks that were destroyed or damaged in the riots that followed an officer-involved shooting that left 29-year-old Jacob Blake in critical condition, function as snowplows in the winter, and the city may not be able to replace them before the first snowfall which, in Wisconsin, could come as early as October. Those trucks ├втВм┼Уwere parked downtown to provide security and limit movement by protesters, were set on fire during the demonstrations.├втВм┬Э Kenosha├втВмтДвs mayor said Monday that he plans on asking the state and federal governments for assistance, and his initial request is $30 million, with the understanding that that number could climb significantly. Individual businesses, now picking up the pieces following three nights of nearly unrestricted rioting, looting, and arson, are also finding that the cost to rebuild may be more than anticipated. According to Fox Business, the used car dealership that rioters burned during the first night of unrest, sustained $1.5 million in damages by itself. ├втВм┼УThe owners of Car Source in Kenosha told local affiliate FOX 6 Milwaukee the business suffered $500,000 in property damage plus between $900,000 and $1 million in inventory damage during the first night of civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man,├втВм┬Э the outlet reported. ├втВм┼УMore than 50 cars were reported to have been damaged in the early Monday morning blaze.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УAnother local business, Dale├втВмтДвs Jewelry, lost $200,000 worth of jewelry and incurred another $200,000 in property damage,├втВм┬Э Fox 6 Milwaukee added. That├втВмтДвs just the beginning. Local media reports include information about dozens of businesses affected by the unrest, and more than a dozen internet fundraisers, designed to help family-owned businesses recover and eventually rebuild, are now active. President Donald Trump, defying requests by the Wisconsin governor and other Democratic officials to stay away from the riot-torn area, will tour Kenosha on Tuesday and survey the extensive damage left from last week├втВмтДвs unrest. His opponent, Democratic 2020 presidential nominee, Joe Biden, addressed the riots in a speech on Monday but neglected to condemn the violence specifically, instead opting to blame Trump├втВмтДвs rhetoric for ongoing, national demonstrations and subsequent damage.

7375,Portland police declare riot on 100th straight night of protests as 'fire bombs' hurled at officers,"'They can't stop the Church of Christ from worshipping' The city government in Seattle closed down a public park ahead of a planned Christian prayer rally, so the supporters held a ""worship protest"" service outside of the fences installed at the park instead.  Organizers planned the worship service at Gas Works Park on Labor Day, but the city said it would shut the service down ""due to anticipated crowding that could impact the public health of residents,"" over the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Seattle Parks and Recreation does not allow unpermitted public events to take place in Seattle parks and asks the public continue to adhere to current public health guidelines so that we can keep our parks open,"" the city added. Sean Feucht Ministries condemned the decision and called out the city's hypocrisy on political rallies. ""This is the height of hypocrisy for the City of Seattle to turn a blind eye to riots, looting, and AntiFa, while refusing to let Christians gather in a public park to sing and worship,"" said Feucht in a statement on Facebook. ""First the government shuts down churches. Now it's shutting down parks to stop us from worshipping. Time to stand up church!"" he added. Hundreds of his supporters heeded the call and showed up on Monday to the ""protest worship"" service. Feucht, a missionary and musician, led the event, and later posted a statement to his social media account. ""America was founded on the freedom to worship. Politicians can write press releases. They can make up threats. They can shut down parks. They can put up fences,"" he wrote.

7403,Some Protests Against Police Brutality Take a More Confrontational Approach,"Police said ""fire bombs"" were thrown at officers during the protest overnight. Tensions boil over during protests on both coasts The 100th consecutive night of protests in Portland quickly escalated into a riot Saturday as people hurled ""multiple fire bombs, mortars, rocks and other items"" at officers, police said. One of the homemade bombs caught a community member on fire. Medics offered treatment at the scene, and the injured individual was later taken to a hospital by a private vehicle, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau. ""This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot,"" the law enforcement agency said in a statement early Sunday. More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said ""it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor. The unrest in Oregon's largest city erupted following the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck as three other officers watched. Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting ""burn it down"" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association. Last weekend, a pro-Trump supporter was shot to death during dueling demonstrations in downtown Portland. The suspected gunman was killed during an encounter with authorities Thursday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",1,3,1,4

7631,Woman Arrested For Facebook Post Promoting Anti-Lockdown Protest in Australia,"Advertisement Supported by The protests are moving into white residential neighborhoods, where activists demand that people choose a side. By Nellie Bowles PORTLAND, Ore. ├втВмтАЭ Terrance Moses was watching protesters against police brutality march down his quiet residential street one recent evening when some in the group of a few hundred suddenly stopped and started yelling. Mr. Moses was initially not sure what the protesters were upset about, but as he got closer, he saw it: His neighbors had an American flag on display. ├втВм┼УIt went from a peaceful march, calling out the names, to all of a sudden, bang, ├втВм╦ЬHow dare you fly the American flag?├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э said Mr. Moses, who is Black and runs a nonprofit group in the Portland, Ore., area. ├втВм┼УThey said take it down. They wouldn├втВмтДвt leave. They said they├втВмтДвre going to come back and burn the house down.├втВм┬Э Mr. Moses and others blocked the demonstrators and told them to leave. ├втВм┼УWe don├втВмтДвt go around terrorizing folks to try and force them to do something they don├втВмтДвt want to do,├втВм┬Э said Mr. Moses, whose nonprofit group provides support for local homeless people. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm a veteran. I├втВмтДвm for these liberties.├втВм┬Э Nearly four months after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, some protesters against police brutality are taking a more confrontational ├втВмтАЭ and personal ├втВмтАЭ approach. The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come ├втВм┼Уout of your house and into the street├втВм┬Э and demonstrate their support. These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause. That includes a diner in Washington who refused to raise her fist to show support for Black Lives Matter, or, in several cities, confused drivers who happened upon the protests. But the tactics are dividing supporters of Black Lives Matter, with some worried that the confrontational approach will antagonize people who would be otherwise be receptive to the message, or play into conservatives├втВмтДв critique of the protests, which have been largely nonviolent nationally. Others, frustrated that little has changed since Mr. Floyd was killed, say that sitting idly and watching a protest without participating nowadays is to show tacit support for racism. ├втВм┼УWe don├втВмтДвt need allies anymore,├втВм┬Э said Stephen Green, an investor and entrepreneur in Portland who is Black. ├втВм┼УWe need accomplices.├втВм┬Э In Rochester, N.Y., protesters have confronted people at outdoor restaurants, shaking dinner tables. Marchers in Washington also accosted people eating outside, urging everyone to raise their fists to show their allegiance to the movement. The more personal tactics echo those being used against elected officials, with activists showing up not only outside mayor├втВмтДвs offices but their homes as well. The apartment building where the mayor of Portland lives has been vandalized. Protesters lit fires outside, ignited fireworks and broke into one of the businesses in the building on his birthday. In San Jose, Calif., demonstrators graffitied and egged the mayor├втВмтДвs house and lit an American flag in front of it, according to the police. In Rochester, people have recently posted police officers├втВмтДв home addresses and information about their families, according to a police spokeswoman. In Portland, Jessie Burke, a local business owner who has Chinese ancestry and identifies as biracial, said the message of the movement was getting lost as the protests escalate and target ordinary residents in their homes. ├втВм┼УEveryone was looking for solutions at first, but now it├втВмтДвs just a nightly fight that has gotten progressively more violent ├втВмтАЭ and every neighborhood worries that the fight will come to their neighborhood,├втВм┬Э Ms. Burke said. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs: ├втВм╦ЬWake up, wake up, you need to be in the street protesting if you stand for this.├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э Still, Mr. Green argued that the tactics were working, even as they inconvenienced him and his family. He described the smell of tear gas and wail of sirens as the marches came to his neighborhood, which he said kept his 7-year-old daughter awake. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs one thing if you can see something on TV, but if you can hear it and you can smell it in your house, that brings it home,├втВм┬Э said Mr. Green, who grew up in Portland. ├втВм┼УWe need people willing to say, ├втВм╦ЬI├втВмтДвm down to lose this friend because stuff needs to change. I├втВмтДвm down to make my neighbor uncomfortable.├втВмтДв Being nice wasn├втВмтДвt changing anything.├втВм┬Э Lindsey E. Murphy agreed. She marched with the protesters through one of Portland├втВмтДвs wealthiest neighborhoods on a recent night and found it deeply moving. She watched white demonstrators shouting at white residents that Black lives matter ├втВмтАЭ and the residents joining in with the chant. ├втВм┼УThe crowd was ├втВмтАЭ I won├втВмтДвt even say mostly white ├втВмтАЭ I├втВмтДвll say it was an almost exclusively white crowd marching through the whitest neighborhood in Portland shouting ├втВм╦ЬBlack lives matter├втВмтДв and ├втВм╦ЬBlack lives are magic,├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э said Ms. Murphy, who is Black and hosts an educational children├втВмтДвs YouTube series. ├втВм┼УWhat I was witnessing was a lamenting prayer, a cry of remorse and shame among the white people. That├втВмтДвs what I saw. It was healing.├втВм┬Э The American flag that generated controversy is displayed in Kenton, a neighborhood of Portland with small bungalows, lush front gardens and ripe fruit trees. Weeks after the confrontation, the husband and wife who fly the flag said they were fearful of retaliation from the roving protesters, who had found their phone number. But they say they will not be intimidated into removing the flag. ├втВм┼УI will not take my flag down,├втВм┬Э said the husband, who declined to provide his name in a brief interview. The same night the protesters came to the couple├втВмтДвs door last month, they marched into Kenton├втВмтДвs commercial district and used restaurant picnic tables as fuel for fires. They collected the colorful wooden dividers the neighbors had recently built for outdoor dining and set those ablaze as well. Mr. Moses and others in the community ran into the protests with fire extinguishers. Protesters that night broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A man was later seen scrubbing the sidewalk graffiti ├втВмтАЭ a popular message was ├втВм┼УPPB = KKK,├втВм┬Э meaning that the Portland Police Bureau is the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Green said that he opposed the destruction of property, but that he also understood it. And he believes, generally, that the more direct protest tactics in residential areas are working because they make the movement more personal, and reveal who truly supports change. If someone is against the movement, they keep their lights off or refuse to raise their fist, he said, adding that taking the debate into homes and to families is essential. Some residents in Portland say the tactics are escalating as the protests become increasingly dominated by white people, including anarchists and supporters of antifa, the diffuse collection of militant left-wing activists that has a strong presence in the region. The movement is splintered in Portland between more mainstream Black Lives Matter marches and the more aggressive, sometimes chaotic antifa or black bloc protests, where demonstrators dress in black and wear motorcycle helmets or ski masks to make it difficult to identify ├втВмтАЭ or later prosecute ├втВмтАЭ them. One night this month, there were two protests promoted on the Black Lives Matter Portland Events page: a ├втВм┼Уnonviolent protest├втВм┬Э in the city center and ├втВм┼Уan autonomously organized direct action march.├втВм┬Э No one appeared to be at the city center protest. But around 200 people were at the other event. They gathered in an unlit park in a residential neighborhood around 8 p.m. Everyone wore black, including some protesters who had on body armor and motorcycle helmets. They hastily set up picnic tables and supply booths in the dark, using cellphones for light to showcase their goods. There was a food table overflowing with protein bars and Monster energy drinks. A small free literature selection was set up on the grass and overseen by three people in ski masks. It was a popular offering, and people crowded around, craning to see the pamphlets. Titles included ├втВм┼УWhy Break Windows├втВм┬Э; ├втВм┼УI Want To Kill Cops Until I├втВмтДвm Dead├втВм┬Э; ├втВм┼УPiece Now, Peace Later: An Anarchist Introduction to Firearms├втВм┬Э; ├втВм┼УIn Defense of Smashing Cameras├втВм┬Э; and ├втВм┼УThree-Way Fight: Revolutionary Anti-Fascism and Armed Self Defense.├втВм┬Э The energy was something like a carnival in the dark. ├втВм┼УPaint balloons, get your paint balloons,├втВм┬Э someone barked. But around 9:30, the group was in some organizational chaos. They had decided that the neighborhood close by was too racially diverse for them to protest in. They needed to go somewhere whiter. So the protesters caravaned 20 minutes away to Alberta, a more affluent neighborhood that began being gentrified in the 1990s. They reassembled and marched through the streets. Neighbors in impressive Craftsman-style homes pulled down their shades and turned off their lights, though many could be seen peering out of dark windows. One woman stepped out of an expansive home looking angry; upon seeing the crowd, she quickly retreated indoors. A few young couples stood in their doorways. A Black woman driving past honked and cheered. One white man stepped onto his patio clapping and hollering in support of the passing march. The group called for him to join. He smiled and waved them on, still clapping. They began to chant that he was spineless. He looked worried. But the march moved along, and he went back into his house. ├втВм┼УYou├втВмтДвll never sleep tight, we do this every night,├втВм┬Э the protesters chanted. Advertisement",1,3,0,0

7673,"Portland Police Change Tactics: Crowd Control Ahead Of ├втВм╦ЬProtests,├втВмтДв Increased Arrests","Police in Australia arrested a 28-year-old woman on Wednesday for publishing a Facebook post that promotes an anti-lockdown protest in the country├втВмтДвs state of Victoria. Footage of the arrest was captured by her partner and shows police officers handcuffing the woman and saying that she├втВмтДвs being charged with ├втВм┼Уincitement.├втВм┬Э The woman├втВмтДвs phone and computers were also seized. The video, which was livestreamed on Facebook, has gone viral and shows the police eventually taking possession of the phone that was broadcasting the encounter. Over two million people have watched the video so far. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs in relation to a Facebook post, in relation to a lockdown protest you put on just that day,├втВм┬Э detective Adrian Smith with the Victorian Police told the woman as she was handcuffed in her home. ├втВм┼УI wasn├втВмтДвt breaking any laws by doing that,├втВм┬Э the woman said, explaining that she had an ultrasound scheduled in an hour because she├втВмтДвs pregnant. ├втВм┼УYou are actually. You are breaking the law,├втВм┬Э Smith responded. ├втВм┼УThat├втВмтДвs why I├втВмтДвm arresting you.├втВм┬Э The woman and her partner, who reportedly live in the city of Ballarat, according to Australia├втВмтДвs ABC News, can be heard on the video offering to take the Facebook post down. But the detective insists that she needs to be arrested because she ├втВм┼Уalready committed the offense.├втВм┬Э The arrest appears to have involved at least four officers. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm happy to delete the post, this is ridiculous,├втВм┬Э the woman said, pleading with the cops and noting that her two children are watching her get arrested. Victoria, which includes the city of Melbourne, has been under strict lockdown measures for the past month after a covid-19 outbreak caused an alarming spike in deaths. Police in Australia have arrested numerous people who├втВмтДвve tried to stage protests against the lockdown, but this is the first known instance of someone in Australia being arrested for merely posting about a protest on Facebook. ├втВм┼УThe search warrant entitles us├втВмтАЭand we├втВмтДвre required to├втВмтАЭseize any computers, any mobile devices you have,├втВм┬Э Detective Smith says. ├втВм┼УI didn├втВмтДвt realize I was doing anything wrong. This is ridiculous,├втВм┬Э the woman says. The woman can be seen getting very distressed as it becomes clear that she├втВмтДвs really being taken into custody and the detective barks ├втВм┼Уlet me finish,├втВм┬Э as he explains what the arrest warrant allows him to take. ├втВм┼УAny mobile telephone you├втВмтДвve got, okay?├втВм┬Э Smith says, before the police turn their attention to the phone that├втВмтДвs broadcasting on Facebook. The Victoria Police Department issued a statement to Australia├втВмтДвs ABC News, saying that ├втВм┼УAny gathering of this nature is in blatant breach of the Chief Health Officer├втВмтДвs directions and puts Victorian lives at risk.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УThose still thinking of attending the protest [├втВм┬ж] can expect a swift and firm response from police,├втВм┬Э the statement continues. ├втВм┼УWe will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.├втВм┬Э The detective in the video, identified as Adrian Smith by the badge around his neck, appears to have been with Victorian Police since 2001, according to a profile on LinkedIn. Australia remains the only wealthy democracy in the world that doesn├втВмтДвt have anything equivalent to America├втВмтДвs First Amendment protections for free speech. And even though it├втВмтДвs clear lockdowns are sometimes necessary to defeat this global pandemic, it├втВмтДвs hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook. This will likely only inspire covid-deniers to become more ridiculous and radicalized than they already are. Far-right goons on Rupert Murdoch├втВмтДвs TV station Sky News Australia have been complaining for months that many actions to fight the covid-19 pandemic have been too extreme. And in this case, they might finally be right. ├втВм┼У...it├втВмтДвs hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook.├втВм┬Э Maybe not so hard - it├втВмтДвs an incitement to behavior that is counter to the health of the population during a pandemic. Victoria has been under strict lockdown for a month and she is advocating breaking the rules (or laws in this case). fb has a broader reach, so 2 million views occurred instead of a few at some illegal protest gathering. ├втВм┼УOh.

7845,Legislative director for Oregon House speaker arrested in Portland riot,"Portland, Oregon, police offices debuted a new set of tactics Monday night, controlling protests before they turned violent and arresting suspected ├втВм┼Уanti-fascist├втВм┬Э operatives when the smaller march threatened destruction. The techniques took Portland├втВмтДвs protest movement by surprise, Oregon Lives reports, and left some demonstrators angry and confused, as an increased number of black-clad marchers ended up in police custody. Portland├втВмтДвs neighborhoods have suffered from ongoing unrest since late May. Until late August, though, much of the violence and destruction was contained to Portland├втВмтДвs city center, with a federal courthouse as rioters├втВмтДв top target. There, protesters tangled with an elite group of Customs and Border Protection Agents sent in to protect federal property. After the Department of Homeland Security withdrew their troops, protests moved to Portland├втВмтДвs residential neighborhoods, and Portland├втВмтДвs police department has been struggling to contain the unrest, often waiting until a demonstration becomes destructive before beginning the process of clearing streets and detaining individual marchers. Over the weekend, violence came to a head, protesters clashed with police and ├втВм┼Уdozens├втВм┬Э were arrested ├втВм┼Уamid the protests in Portland included one juvenile and people from outside of Oregon, including California, Canada, Minnesota, Washington, and Texas, the Multnomah Co. Sheriff├втВмтДвs Office said Monday,├втВм┬Э according to Fox News. The confrontations triggered Oregon├втВмтДвs Democrat Gov. Kate Brown to press Portland law enforcement to investigate ├втВм┼Уany alleged incidents├втВм┬Э involving officers for signs of police brutality. Monday night, the Portland Police struck first, declaring a planned march to a police administration building ├втВм┼Уunlawful,├втВм┬Э moving through the protesters├втВмтДв camp, and confiscating materials typically used in riots. ├втВм┼УSeveral dozen Portland police moved on protesters gathering in a North Portland park Monday night even before the group started marching,├втВм┬Э Oregon Live reported Tuesday. ├втВм┼УThe armored officers swept through the park, confiscating homemade shields and other articles. A scuffle broke out when officers tried to confiscate a picket sign that read ├втВм┼Уvote,├втВм┬Э multiple videos from the scene showed, and at least one person was detained. Police also deployed pepper spray.├втВм┬Э The raid delayed the march and splintered it into smaller, more manageable factions. When demonstrators eventually regrouped, police immediately declared sidewalks and public roads off-limits. Eventually, Portland police declared the march an ├втВм┼Уunlawful assembly├втВм┬Э and began arresting those suspected of inciting violence. ├втВм┼УTwenty-four people were ultimately arrested. The vast majority are accused of interfering with a peace officer, disorderly conduct, or both charges,├втВм┬Э Oregon Live added. Although the scene became chaotic, for the first time in several weeks, protesters were unable to set the police administration building on fire. Oregon Live notes that Portland police expect that all 24 individuals arrested will be back on the street Tuesday night, given that the Portland District Attorney will not prosecute protesters for small crimes like ├втВм┼Уinterfering with a peace officer├втВм┬Э or ├втВм┼Уdisorderly conduct.├втВм┬Э In some extreme cases, Oregon State Police, also involved in nightly crowed control, can refer certain protesters for Federal prosecution ├втВмтАЭ as The Daily Wire earlier this month, the Oregon State Police were deputized by DHS ├втВмтАЭ but those cases are rare.

In Minnesota, activists say they are prepared for the long fight against injustice. Protesters rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday evening in a collective call for justice for Taylor├втВмтДвs family, and a conviction for former officer Brett Hankison. They are coming down the ramp closing highway 94 East in Saint Paul pic.twitter.com/9I2J3hg4y1 ├втВмтАЭ Dymanh Chhoun (@Dymanh) September 24, 2020  Demonstrators then began marching down University Avenue, before dozens walked onto Interstate 94 in St. Paul after 8 p.m., closing both directions until about 8:40 p.m. (credit: CBS) Minnesota State Patrol squad cars were seen escorting small buses onto the highway, which may have been in preparation for arresting people who didn├втВмтДвt disperse. It is unclear as of late Wednesday night if anyone was taken into custody. After a day of protests in Louisville, rioters started setting fires in the streets at night. CBS News reports that two Louisville police officers were shot, but it is not clear if it was connected to the protests. The grand jury charged Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment. The charges against him were for shooting into neighboring apartments, not directly related to Taylor├втВмтДвs death. Louisville Police shot the 26-year-old EMT in March while executing a no-knock warrant at her apartment during a narcotics investigation. Taylor├втВмтДвs boyfriend fired one shot at police, saying he believed they were intruders. Three officers returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were ever found in her home. ├втВм┼УThe decision before my office as the special prosecutor in this case is not to decide if the loss of Miss Taylor├втВмтДвs life is a tragedy. The answer to that question unequivocally is yes,├втВм┬Э Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said. Many in Minnesota, where George Floyd died while being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, say the grand jury├втВмтДвs decision to charge only one of the three officers involved is not justice for Taylor├втВмтДвs family. Some took to social media to express their concerns over the decision to charge Hankison, but not the other two officers, who still work for the Louisville Police Department. ├втВм┼УI think it was a compromise ├втВм┬ж brought to bear by the protest and national protest, and they felt like they have to do something,├втВм┬Э community activist Mel Reeves, who founded the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, said. ├втВм┼УThe whole thing is just a mess, and again it├втВмтДвs proof positive the system and the way that they do criminal justice is just wrong.├втВм┬Э Reeves says it├втВмтДвs infuriating that the life of the aspiring nurse is not worth charging the people who he says are responsible for her death. ├втВм┼УI think the other two people should have been charged with endangering her life as well, reckless endangerment of some kind,├втВм┬Э Reeves said. He says activists across the country are digging in their heels, ready to take a stand against a system that he and others believe is not fair. For now they rally, march and try and change laws, seeking to create a system that has equal treatment for all. Last week, the city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylor├втВмтДвs family $12 million to settle a civil lawsuit, the most the city has ever paid in a police misconduct case. The mayor also pledged police reforms, including an overhaul of search warrant procedures. The family├втВмтДвs attorney called Wednesday├втВмтДвs decision outrageous and offensive.",0,0,1,3

""Kristina Narayan was arrested for Interfering with a Police Officer after the event became a riot and the crowd was given multiple orders to disperse, which she did not do,├втВм┬Э said Officer Derek Carmon, a Portland Police Bureau spokesman, in a statement to the Hill. Narayan is the legislative director for Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek, according to a report from the Washington Free Beacon. Narayan has worked for Kotek, a Democrat, since 2016.

7901,'Angry Salon Customers' Protest By Hanging Blow Dryers Outside Nancy Pelosi├втВмтДвs Home,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since  Former Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang rallied Asian Americans to vote against Donald Trump in what he said could be a political gamechanger for the often overlooked community. ""If we get out in force and help Joe and Kamala win, this could be the major political awakening that Asian Americans have been waiting for a generation or more,"" Yang said Monday night in a virtual fundraiser for Asian Americans Against Trump. Yang was joined by prominent Asian American leaders and public figures, including Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna and Grace Meng, Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim, Pachinko author Min Jin Lee. The American entrepreneur said Asian Americans have been ""forced to become more engaged"" politically as they continue to suffer attacks from the ""hostility"" targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community during the coronavirus pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been vulnerable to racist attacks, as President Donald Trump has used misleading and racist terms to describe the virus which experts said exacerbates microaggressions targeting the AAPI community. Yang said engaging with politics is a ""non-choice"" and an obligation for AAPI voters. ""We have to roll our sleeves up and do things we have not done as a community as high of a level as, frankly, people in other communities,"" Yang said. ""Our community can be the margin of victory and help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, our first Asian-American and Black woman vice president,"" NY Rep. Meng said. Asian American voters are the fastest-growing voting bloc with over 11 million eligible voters. California Rep. Khanna warned that ""anyone who thinks this election is not going to be very close, [is] underestimating Donald Trump's power to do everything possible to win. He's frankly mobilizing the power of the US government on behalf of his campaign"" and told Asian American voters that ""the only way we overcome that is by a massive turnout."" But to mobilize Asian American voters, the AAPI community must actively dispel the model minority myth, which is ""used by leaders to either be a wedge against other people of color or they are being used as some sort of pestilence,"" Lee said. Stereotyping Asian Americans as educated and hard-working, the model minority myth limits Asian Americans as people who are perfectly suited to be led, but not necessarily lead themselves. At the same time, the model minority myth does not capture the challenges that Asian Americans face and paints them under a monolithic narrative that is used as a wedge to pit them against other minorities. ""We still are in that place where we are expected to be the model minority, we are expected to be the ones who work hard, do really great work but never be the leaders,"" Kim said. ""If we can get the message out to other Asian Americans to have a say and a stake in the country where we live ├втВмтАЭ we will be much more respected, much more powerful, and much more considered when it comes to the politics of our country.""",1,2,0,0
7925,Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad Says Under House Arrest After Protests Over Dalit Woman's Rape In Uttar Pradesh In Hathras,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Matthew Tostevin 4 Min Read BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people joined Thailand├втВмтДвs biggest protest in years on Saturday, cheering calls to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn├втВмтДвs monarchy and for the removal of former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister. ├втВм┼УUnless the monarchy is under the constitution, we will never achieve true democracy,├втВм┬Э protest leader and human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa told the crowd gathered within sight of the Grand Palace in central Bangkok. ├втВм┼УMore, more,├втВм┬Э the crowd chanted after Arnon called for cuts to the royal budget and changes to the constitution to bring the king clearly under its control. The Royal Palace was not available for comment on the protest and the demands for reform. ├втВм┼УPeople can protest but they should do that peacefully and within the law,├втВм┬Э said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri when asked to comment. Arnon said protesters would on Sunday declare ├втВм┼Уthe country belongs to the people, not the monarchy├втВм┬Э and place a commemorative brass plaque, echoing the words of the leaders of the 1932 upheaval that ended absolute monarchy. Protests that have been building in the southeast Asian country of 70 million since mid-July have broken a long-standing taboo by criticising the monarchy as well as seeking a new constitution and elections. Related Coverage  Thai authorities have said criticising the monarchy is unacceptable in a country where the king is constitutionally ├втВм┼Уenthroned in a position of revered worship├втВм┬Э. Lese majeste laws mean those insulting the monarchy can be jailed. ├втВм┼УDON├втВмтДвT TALK ABOUT THE KING├втВм┬Э Conservatives are horrified by attacks on the monarchy. ├втВм┼УYou can drive out the prime minister, but don├втВмтДвt talk about the king,├втВм┬Э commented one Facebook user as speeches were broadcast live from the protest. Reuters reporters estimated there were at least 30,000 people in the demonstration. Organisers said there were more than 50,000, while police said there were 18,000, still enough to make it the biggest since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup. Protesters have said they plan to march to Government House on Sunday morning. The king was not in Thailand and has spent much of his time in Europe since taking the throne from his late father in 2016. Speakers at the protest criticised the king for his absence and for his personal behaviour, comments that until recently would not have been made in public. ├втВм┼УThe people are humans, not dust under your royal feet,├втВм┬Э student leader Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul told the protest early on Sunday. ├втВм┼УThe people want a king who protects democracy, not one who betrays the people├втВмтДвs democracy.├втВм┬Э The military, which proclaims itself the defender of the monarchy and national stability, has carried out several bloody crackdowns on protesters since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 as well as 13 successful coups. Sept. 19 is the anniversary of the coup against the populist then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006. Among the protesters were many of his red shirt followers, veterans of clashes a decade ago with pro-establishment yellow shirts. ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm here to fight for the future of my children and grandchildren. I hope that by the time I die, they will become free,├втВм┬Э said 68-year-old Tasawan Suebthai, a redshirt with amulets round her neck which she hoped would ward off bullets. The latest protests have been peaceful so far, but more than a dozen protest leaders have been arrested and released on bail. None has been charged under the lese majeste laws which protesters want scrapped. They also seek to reduce the king├втВмтДвs constitutional powers and his control over the palace fortune and units of the army.

7929,"BLM rallies, memorial for man killed in Portland shooting - Breitbart","Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad says they will continue to fight over UP woman's rape. (File) Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who was accompanying the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died after being gang raped in Uttar Pradesh, from Delhi to Hathras said on Wednesday that he was detained by Uttar Pradesh police midway and has now been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. ""The whole world saw how our sister was cremated at night in the absence of the family and without their consent, in connivance of the government and the police. The morality of these people is dead. I was detained by their police the night before and now I have been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. But we will fight,"" Mr Azad tweeted in Hindi. He also shared a picture of the notice issued to him by the Saharanpur police, which stated: ""You are being informed that CrPC section 144 is imposed in the district. There are credible inputs that your tours and acts are gathering crowds, which may lead to law and order situation. Any untoward incident may happen. Hence, you are being informed that you will stay in your house only."" The order, issued by the local Fatehpur police station in-charge Manoj Chaudhary, also warned Mr Azad of legal action for violating the instruction. Mr Chaudhary said it was not a ""house arrest"" but Mr Azad has been asked to remain at his home in view of the law and order situation. ""There is no time limit on the order as such,"" he added. According to functionaries of the Azad Samaj Party, which was launched by the Bhim Army chief in March, Azad and Delhi unit head Himanshu Balmiki had gone missing after 10 pm on Tuesday while they were on their way to Hathras, accompanying the family of the woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday. The Azad Samaj Party and affiliates of the pro-Dalit Bhim Army, among others, had joined the protests outside Safdarjung hospital in the national capital on Tuesday to demand justice for the gangrape victim and her family. ""There is no clue about the location of Chandrashekhar Azad and Himanshu almiki after they reached the Jewar toll plaza to get on the lane to Tappal, Aligarh,"" Azad Samaj Party's core committee member Ravindra Bhati said earlier on Wednesday. He alleged that Mr Azad and Himanshu Balmiki were detained during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, but the police were not making it public. The body of the woman was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family members alleging that the local police forced them to perform the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, said that the victim was cremated ""according to the wishes of the family"". Around 12:30 pm on Wednesday, dozens of Azad Samaj Party and Bhim Army activists reached the Tappal police station in Aligarh and staged a demonstration. ""A delegation of our representatives will be meeting senior police and administration officials to inquire about Azad and Balmiki,"" Bhati told the protesters inside the Tappal police station compound. A senior Aligarh police official said: ""I have no idea about this (detention) claim.""  The district police chief and some other senior officers could not be contacted as according to another police official, they have been infected with the coronavirus and are under medication for the last three-four days.

7955,Democrats Praise Peaceful Protests As Violent Riots That Are Trump├втВмтДвs Fault [Satire] | The Daily Wire,"The overwhelming majority of demonstrations this summer were peaceful, according to a new report, which also warns that the upcoming election and President Donald Trump├втВмтДвs incendiary rhetoric ├втВмтАЭ which has placed an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests ├втВмтАЭ could plunge the country into further crisis. The report, published Thursday, is from the U.S. Crisis Monitor, a collaboration between the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Princeton University├втВмтДвs Bridging Divides Initiative, which collects and analyzes real-time data on protest movements, using news reports, social media and other sources. ├втВм┼УThese data reveal that the United States is in crisis. It faces a multitude of concurrent, overlapping risks ├втВмтАЭ from police abuse and racial injustice, to pandemic-related unrest and beyond ├втВмтАЭ all exacerbated by increasing polarization,├втВм┬Э the researchers wrote, warning that ├втВм┼Уthese intersecting risks are likely to intensify├втВм┬Э as the November election draws closer. The report covers data gathered on protests between May 24, the day before police in Minneapolis killed George Floyd, and Aug. 22. During that period, the researchers collected more than 10,600 demonstration events across the country, with more than 7,750 of them related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests peaked in late May and early June, and while they have leveled off since, activists in many places across the country continue to hold largely peaceful demonstrations every day. The overwhelming majority of the protests ├втВмтАЭ more than 10,100 ├втВмтАЭ involved peaceful protesters, the researchers found. In only about 5%, or under 570 of the protests, did participants engage in violence. ├втВм┼УThe vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent,├втВм┬Э the researchers wrote. ├втВм┼УIn more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity.├втВм┬Э In the protests that became violent, they either involved state-sanctioned violence, such as violent intervention from local, state or federal authorities, or counterprotesters from extremist groups. The police or military ├втВм┼Уdisproportionately used force while intervening in demonstrations associated with the BLM movement, relative to other types of demonstrations,├втВм┬Э the researchers found. According to their data, in nearly 10% of BLM protests recorded this summer, police violently intervened by deploying tear gas, rubber bullets and/or pepper spray, as well as assaulting protesters with batons. During this period, the researchers also found an uptick in ├втВм┼Уgovernment violence against journalists,├втВм┬Э collecting over 100 separate incidents in at least 31 states and the District of Columbia. As for why public opinion polling suggests that people think a disproportionate number of the protests were violent when in fact they were not, the report attributes those perceptions to respondents├втВмтДв existing political views, media coverage of violent protests and disinformation campaigns on social media. The report stresses the gravity of the situation, as the sources of this uprising ├втВмтАЭ from racial inequities, to continued police violence, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic ├втВмтАЭ are continuing. It warns that the upcoming election and Trump├втВмтДвs consistent attempts to sow discord and cast doubt on the election results will exacerbate these forces, citing ├втВм┼Уmultiple steps to inflame these tensions├втВм┬Э from Trump and his administration. Trump has made much of his re-election campaign about ├втВм┼Уlaw and order,├втВм┬Э with an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests, racist appeals to white voters and false conspiracy theories about voting by mail. ├втВм┼УIn this hyper-polarized environment, state forces are taking a more heavy-handed approach to dissent, non-state actors are becoming more active and assertive, and counter-demonstrators are looking to resolve their political disputes in the street,├втВм┬Э the researchers wrote. ├втВм┼УWithout significant mitigation efforts, these risks will continue to intensify in the lead-up to the vote, threatening to boil over in November if election results are delayed, inconclusive, or rejected as fraudulent.├втВм┬Э Read the full report here.

7991,SPD watchdog: Sergeant did not intentionally target boy with pepper spray at protest,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) ├втВмтАЭ People gathered for Black Lives Matter rallies Saturday evening in Portland, Oregon, and a memorial was held for the man fatally shot last weekend after a right-wing caravan went through downtown, as daily demonstrations stretched well past the three-month mark in the city. Hundreds of people gathered in a park just north of Portland in Vancouver, Washington, for a memorial service for Aaron ├втВм┼УJay├втВм┬Э Danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer, who was killed Aug. 29. The suspect was himself shot and killed by police Thursday. Families showed up at the event with their kids, lining up for the free BBQ and picnicking on the grass at Esther Short Park. As various speakers addressed the audience on stage, attendees waved their flags enthusiastically, occasionally breaking out into chants of ├втВм┼УU-S-A!├втВм┬Э Many of the crowd were President Donald Trump supporters, wearing MAGA hats and shirts or holding Trump-Pence flags. Some also waved flags and wore T-shirts showing support for the police. Some attendees also wore T-shirts with ├втВм┼УJustice for J├втВм┬Э that were handed out at the event. Several local members of Proud Boys, a far-right group that has been involved in skirmishes at local protests, attended. ├втВм┼УWe honor a man who died for what he believed in,├втВм┬Э said James Johnson, who has been a member of the Proud Boys for two years. Johnson, who is Black, said he disagreed with people who label the group as a white supremacist organization. The crowded regularly erupted in boos with any mention of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, whom Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson demanded apologize to Danielson├втВмтДвs family because they felt he had been unfairly portrayed. ├втВм┼УThis is about truth and lies,├втВм┬Э Gibson said. ├втВм┼УJay was not a white supremacist.├втВм┬Э Authorities released additional court documents late Friday detailing the moments before Danielson├втВмтДвs slaying. The documents included shots of security footage that showed the suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, ducked into a parking garage and reached toward a pocket or pouch at his waist before emerging to follow the victim. Danielson was holding bear spray and an expandable baton and had a loaded Glock handgun in a holster at his waist, according to the documents. Authorities have said they believe Reinoehl, who was fatally shot by law enforcement officers late Thursday in Washington state, killed Danielson. Witnesses told police that just before they heard gunshots someone said something like, ├втВм┼Уwanna go,├втВм┬Э which is frequently a challenge to a fight. Danielson, 39, was shot in the chest and died at the scene. The court documents were filed to support second-degree murder charges against Reinoehl, who was a supporter of antifa ├втВмтАЭ shorthand for anti-fascists and an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events. Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. They have often been marked by vandalism and violence. Black Lives Matter rallies were taking place in the city Saturday evening and night, and BLM supporters drove vehicles through the city earlier Saturday. At one event Saturday afternoon, people stenciled names on a pathway of Black people killed by police. Late Friday protests continued into early Saturday in Portland, with police declaring an unlawful assembly and arresting 27 people. A few hundred demonstrators had met at Kenton Park Friday before making their way to the Portland Police Association building, where officers warned protesters to stay off the streets and private property. Those who refused could be subject to citation, arrest, the use of tear gas, crowd-control agents or impact munitions, police said. The Portland Police Bureau issued a statement Saturday morning saying some officers reported that rocks, a full beverage can and water bottles had been thrown at them, prompting police to declare the gathering an unlawful assembly. Police said one woman who was detained was bleeding from an abrasion on her head, and she was treated by medics at the scene before being transported by an ambulance. The Portland Police Bureau said she jumped out of the ambulance and ran away before it left the scene, however. Most of those arrested were arrested on suspicion of interfering with a peace officer or disorderly conduct, police said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Michael Forest Reinoehl was killed by law enforcement officers, not federal agents. ___ Ding reported from Vancouver, Washington.  .

8070,Massive anti-lockdown protest fills up Trafalgar Square in London,"CNN is now reporting that the mostly peaceful demonstrations for racial justice are all Donald Trump├втВмтДвs fault because they├втВмтДвre violent riots serving no purpose at all. In the cable network├втВмтДвs latest news show, Preposterous Sources, a Volkswagen pulls up and dozens of CNN commentators amazingly yet hilariously pour out onto the set and begin denouncing Trump for the violence that isn├втВмтДвt happening in the mostly peaceful cities that are burning down for some reason that is Trump├втВмтДвs fault. After gleefully honking his red rubber nose, Don Lemon told his viewer, ├втВм┼УLet me pretend to be clear. These cities you see where innocent people are brutalized ├втВмтАЭ this is Donald Trump├втВмтДвs America ├втВмтАЭ or at least those parts of Donald Trump├втВмтДвs America that are governed by Democrats and that├втВмтДвs why they├втВмтДвre mostly peaceful.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УAnd I├втВмтДвm very serious about this as you can tell from the faint moistness in my eyes, which I feel gives me the sensitive look of a graceful doe in a peaceful forest glade,├втВм┬Э Lemon added. ├втВм┼УBut perhaps that├втВмтДвs beside the point.├втВм┬Э Joe Biden has also emerged from his basement to praise the mostly peaceful protests that are actually riots that are Trump├втВмтДвs fault, so he denounces them. Speaking to a broom closet he mistook for a meeting of very thin people re-enacting the Bride of Frankenstein, Biden said, ├втВм┼УC├втВмтДвmon, man! These are people. When I look at them I see the whole history of a kind of thing that we need to do better because do I look like someone who would support radical leftists like my good friend Bernie Sanders or my running mate Kamala Harris? I mean, who do you think I am?├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УNo really, who DO you think I am, because I can├втВмтДвt remember,├втВм┬Э Biden said. ├втВм┼УAnd while you├втВмтДвre at it, where do you think I live, because I├втВмтДвd like to get back in the basement.├втВм┬Э Biden then declared victory in the election and resigned the presidency, which would make Kamala Harris the first woman of color ever to become president in an old man├втВмтДвs imagination.

8117,"Trump rallies may be responsible for roughly 700 Covid-19 deaths, study finds","SEATTLE ├втВмтАЭ Investigators with Seattle├втВмтДвs Office of Police Accountability say officers did not intentionally target a young boy when they hit him in the face with pepper spray during a protest. Video of the boy crying, with milk running down his face to lessen the effects of the spray, went viral after the May 30 protest and led to 13,000 complaints filed with OPA. According to an OPA description released Friday, ├втВм┼У(The boy) and his father moved towards a protester who had grabbed an officer├втВмтДвs baton and was pushing into the police line. An SPD supervisor used pepper spray to move the protester back. In response, the protester ducked, causing the pepper spray to inadvertently affect the boy and his father.├втВм┬Э >>RAW: Family of 7-year-old who was pepper-sprayed during Seattle protest speaks out OPA investigators found the sergeant who used the spray followed SPD policy in response to the protester├втВмтДвs actions, and investigators say their review of the body cameras worn by officers showed the sergeant was not able to see the child. After the incident, many people on social media claimed to identify the officer who used the pepper spray. Scroll down to continue reading But OPA investigators found the complainants identified the wrong officer, and that the pepper spraying was actually done by a sergeant. In another incident caught on camera, OPA investigators found an officer├втВмтДвs use of force was ├втВм┼Уimproper and inconsistent with SPD policy and training├втВм┬Э when he placed his knee on a person├втВмтДвs neck during an arrest for 13 seconds. That case is currently before Interim Chief Adrian Diaz for discipline. OPA received a total of 19,000 complaints regarding officer conduct during protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Most of the complaints referred to the same incidents and the civilian-led oversight office is currently reviewing about 100 cases. The following statement was released on behalf of the Avery family, whose boy was pepper sprayed: ├втВм┼УWe are deeply disappointed, but not surprised, by the result reached by the OPA. Today, they have confirmed that it is the Seattle Police Department├втВмтДвs position that the use of pepper spray in an intentional and reckless manner that it would strike an innocent child exercising their First Amendment rights is ├втВм┼Уwithin policy.├втВм┬Э We understand the OPA has said it is ├втВм┼Уsorry├втВм┬Э for these actions. But ├втВм┼Уsorry├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼Уregret├втВм┬Э is not sufficient. We demand change. OPA did not address the whether the officers could have ta steps to prevent this from happening and, even further, no police officers attempted to render aid to the child making any apology tough to accept. Moreover, the OPA reached its conclusions by analysis and discussion of body camera footage├втВмтАЭtapes that were not provided to the family or their legal counsel before today. The OPA├втВмтДвs also refuses to identify the officers who used force in this incident. All of this undermines the claims of objectivity and transparency that the City purports to value. We continue to demand change, and this confirms that it is still deeply needed because the City of Seattle continues to remain indifferent to the suffering its police, and other City officials, have caused to black and indigenous people of color for decades, including the Avery family.├втВм┬Э More news from KIRO 7 DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP Cox Media Group ├В┬й 2021 Cox Media Group.

8262,Denver shooting at protest leaves 1 dead; news station's private security guard in custody,"The president is most likely a superspreader. A study conducted by four Stanford University economic researchers determined that 18 Trump campaign rallies, the bulk of which took place over the past summer, ├втВм┼Уultimately resulted in more than 30,000 incremental confirmed cases of COVID-19├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼Уlikely led to more than 700 deaths.├втВм┬Э The study examined 18 counties that hosted Trump rallies in locations such as Tulsa, Oklahoma; Phoenix, Arizona; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, held between June 20 and September 22. It then compared the rate of post-rally Covid-19 infections in the host counties to that of comparable counties that did not host a rally. Attendance at individual rallies varied, but Trump often draws thousands of supporters to these events. ├втВм┼УFor the vast majority of county matching procedures we employ,├втВм┬Э the authors wrote, ├втВм┼Уour estimate of the average treatment effect across the eighteen rallies implies that they increased subsequent confirmed cases of COVID-19 by more than 250 per 100,000 residents.├втВм┬Э The researchers ├втВмтАЭ B. Douglas Bernheim, an economics professor at Stanford, and Stanford grad students Nina Buchmann, Zach Freitas-Groff, and Sebasti├Г┬бn Otero ├втВмтАЭ extrapolated that figure to the entire sample, concluding that the rallies led to thousands of new infections and, likely, hundreds of deaths. As the authors acknowledge, trying to identify exactly how many infections resulted from a Trump rally (or any other potential superspreader event) is not easy. Factors such as whether the rally is held indoor or outdoor, whether a large number of infected people attended, whether attendees wore masks, and ├втВм┼Уthe distribution of infected individuals among rally attendees├втВм┬Э can all lead to vastly different rates of infection. Likewise, while the authors estimate Trump├втВмтДвs summer rallies led to more than 700 deaths, they note those deaths were ├втВм┼Уnot necessarily among attendees.├втВм┬Э For example, a rally-goer may become infected with a mild case, but that same rally-goer might give the virus to his wife, who gives it to a coworker, who gives it to their sister, who dies of Covid-19. Nevertheless, the average discrepancies between the number of infections in counties hosting Trump rallies and the infection rates in other, similar counties suggest that at least some of Trump├втВмтДвs campaign events were superspreader events, potentially responsible for hundreds of lost lives. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that Trump was ├втВм┼Уasking for trouble├втВм┬Э by hosting mass political rallies as the number of Covid-19 infections surge. But Fauci├втВмтДвs warning does not appear to have deterred the president, who reportedly plans to host 14 rallies in the final three days of the 2020 campaign. ntribute today from as little as $3.

8308,Gutfeld on Trump's rallies and Biden's seclusion,"Published 10:32, 24 October 2020 BST| Last updated 10:37, 24 October 2020 BST It's been another fairly standard week for Marcus Rashford. Last Saturday he was bagging against Newcastle, on Tuesday he scored the winner against Paris Saint Germain, and since returning to British soil he has been working tirelessly to help feed disadvantaged children during half term. On Thursday, MPs voted against a motion to extend free school meals during the half term break amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But Manchester United and England forward Rashford - or Rashford MBE as we should now call him - did not give up the fight. As well as mucking in to lend a hand at the FareShare warehouse with his mum, the 22-year-old has also been helming a movement on Twitter. Using the hashtag #endchildfoodpoverty, he collated pubs, restaurants and cafes across the country that are stepping up to offer free meals during the half term break. After going at it all day yesterday (23 October), Rashford said he was knocking off with a feeling of 'pride'. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: ""Growing up we didn't have a lot, but we always had the safety net of the community. That community was my family. When we stumbled, we were caught with open arms. ""Even at their lowest point, having felt the devastating effects of the pandemic, local businesses have wrapped arms around their communities today, catching vulnerable children as they fell. ""I couldn't be more proud to call myself British tonight. I am truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. ""You want to talk about 'celebrities' and 'superstars', look no further than my Twitter feed and that's exactly what you'll find."" He's not wrong either - here's just a handful of places that are helping out:  If you head to his Twitter feed you will find many more. In Scotland and Wales, governments have extended free meals during school holidays until Easter, while in Northern Ireland they'll be provided over the half-term break this month. A number of councils in England, including those in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, have also agreed to supply disadvantaged pupils with vouchers. McDonald's is also partnering with FareShare to offer one million free meals. You can find the businesses, services and organisations offering free meals over the school holidays near you by entering your postcode into this school meal finder.

One person was shot and killed, and a local news station's private security guard was in custody Saturday evening after protests between opposing groups turned violent in Denver's Civic Center Park, city police said. ***Must Credit: @rustyyyyy69 via Storyful*** The man who was shot was part of a pro-police ""Patriot Rally,"" according to a report. ""Further investigation has determined the suspect is a private security guard with no affiliation with Antifa,"" the Denver Police Department wrote in a Twitter message. Matthew Dolloff Courtesy Denver Police/ Twitter KUSA-TV, a local Denver news station also known as 9NEWS, reported that a suspect in police custody was a private security guard hired by the station. ""The private security guard was contracted through Pinkerton by 9NEWS,"" the news outlet wrote.

Denver police said they had one suspect in custody and were investigating the incident as a homicide. Police had a large presence at the protests to keep opposing protesters calm. ""There was a large presence because we had two groups with opposing views, and we know that can always get very tense,"" Montoya said. ""There├втВмтДвs always potential for violence, we understand that.

8411,"Community rallies to help Latina leader hit by Covid, now in need of double-lung transplant","CHANNELS TELEVISION Advertisement   The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has dissolved the infamous subunit of the force, the Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS). ├втВм┼УThe Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian Police, otherwise known as SARS, is hereby dissolved across all formations, the 36 state police command and the Federal Capital Territory where they currently exist,├втВм┬Э the IGP said on Sunday. ├втВм┼УAll officers and men currently serving in the unit are to be redeployed with immediate effect.├втВм┬Э The police authorities will be announcing new policing arrangements to address the offences of armed robbery and other violent crimes that fall within the mandate of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad later. Adamu├втВмтДвs announcement followed days of widespread protests by Nigerians demanding scrapping of the unit which had gained notoriety for brutality and human rights violations.   Beyond scrapping the unit, he acknowledged reports of extortion and brutality, announcing a plan for an investigation. ├втВм┼УTo deal with the reports of crimes committed against citizens an investigation team will be constituted which will include civil society organisations for transparency and the culprits will be punished,├втВм┬Э he said.

Witnesses said Isiaq was shot by the police. In contrast with the action of the police including the use of tear gas on protesters and the shooting witnessed, the IGP described the protests ├втВм┼Уas a manifestation of the natural desires of citizens to participate in matters concerning policing and internal security in the nation├втВм┬Э. To better relations between the public and the police, the IGP also announced ├втВм┼Уa citizens and strategic (stake)holders forum will be formed to regularly interface with the leadership of the police at all levels and advice on police activities├втВм┬Э.  #IGPDissolvesSARS pic.twitter.com/A1TvvefbOu ├втВмтАЭ Nigeria Police Force (@PoliceNG) October 11, 2020    The unit was founded in 1992 to combat cases of armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes. But SARS, instead, over time, has gained notoriety for its reckless intimidation of innocent civilians through puerile profiling and wanton abuse of power. Calls for the unit├втВмтДвs disbandment date as far back as 2017 and while the Federal Government and police chiefs have made several pledges to implement reforms, reports of SARS├втВмтДв brutal activities against civilians have not abated. The current wave of protest can be traced to October 3, after another report of extra-judicial killing in Delta State (the police have denied any killing took place). It sparked fresh concerns and anger. Fuelled by this, and the outpouring of tales of traumatic experiences at the hands of officials of the unit, many Nigerians have held protests in many states, including Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory, Kaduna, Osun, Edo, and Imo.   RELATED LIVE: #EndSARS Protests Continue, Gain Momentum #EndSARS: Reps Unveil 30-Day Plan To Tackle Police Brutality   The Speaker House of Representatives, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, has also unveiled some of the plans by the House, aimed at tackling police brutality in the country. In a statement signed personally on Wednesday, Gbajabiamila said over the next 30 days, the House will work with the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), civil society and with Nigerians of good conscience to draft new legislation that establishes a system of independent accountability from the Force. According to him, the new legislation will hold erring members of the Police Force to account for their conduct in the performance of their duties and impose civil and criminal liability for violations of the Police Code. It will also compel the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to take responsibility for the failures of training and discipline that leads to such violations. Advertisement",0,0,0,0

Carmen Lerma, 52, wants to share her story to educate others. Lerma is hospitalized at UW Health in Madison and is on the organ donation list, waiting to receive a double-lung transplant. She contracted coronavirus in July and spent over a month and a half in intensive care. Even though Lerma did not have any underlying medical conditions, doctors say her lungs suffered irreversible damage. ├втВм┼УThat was a hard pill to swallow, because I'm like: ├втВм╦ЬWait, what? What do you mean?├втВмтДв And they said, ├втВм╦ЬYour lungs are not going to get any better unless we do this,├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э she told Milwaukee's NBC affiliate TMJ4 News. On Monday, she was set to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a form of life support that essentially takes the place of the heart and lungs, according to the American Thoracic Society. She hasn├втВмтДвt been able to see visitors for three months. Lerma is director for events and community outreach at United Migrant Opportunity Services (UMOS), a nonprofit advocacy organization providing programs and services to under-served populations. ├втВм┼УIf you think that this virus is a simple flu or that it├втВмтДвs not as bad as it├втВмтДвs seems to be ... listen to my story carefully you will learn the struggle,├втВм┬Э Lerma wrote on Facebook. ├втВм┼УI miss my family, but I get strength in thinking of them├втВм┬Э Lerma said. In Milwaukee, the community is rallying behind her to help with medical expenses. Don Cohen, vice president of community development at Landmark Credit Union in the Milwaukee area, has worked with Lerma for years, partnering with UMOS on a variety of community events. Cohen and Victor Huyke, the owner of El Conquistador, a Latino newspaper, knew Lerma was really worried about the hospital expenses. In response, they created a GoFundMe page that has raised over $27,614 as of Monday afternoon. ├втВм┼УThis really has taken a huge load off her mind,├втВм┬Э Cohen told NBC News in an email. A fundraiser has also been scheduled for Thursday, which will include raffles and live performances. Across the Midwest, coronavirus cases are surging. Wisconsin reported over 3,861 new coronavirus cases on Friday and the state now ranks fourth in a seven-day tally of new cases. Nationwide, more than 220,000 people in the United States have died of Covid-19, according to an NBC News tracker. Carmen Hernandez, 47, has volunteered with Lerma in the past and says ""everyone"" in Milwaukee knows her. Whether it's helping low-income families pay off their utility bills or handing out backpacks with school supplies, Lerma is a welcoming face in the community. ├втВм┼УShe is very kind. She is very loved,├втВм┬Э said Hernandez by phone. ├втВм┼УI feel so bad for her situation right now.

8757,"#EndSars: Priest joins protest in Auchi, Edo State (Photos/Video)","The White House coronavirus task force expressed concern about virus spread stemming from small household gatherings as coronavirus cases rise across the country and colder months approach. The warnings come as President Donald Trump continues ignoring precautions as he gathers thousands of mostly maskless supporters at rallies across the country in the final sprint before the election. Mitigation efforts ├втВмтАЬ wearing a mask, social distancing ├втВмтАЬ in retail settings such as stores and restaurants are working, the task force suggested in its weekly report released to states Tuesday. But the same precautions aren├втВмтДвt being taken as smaller groups of friends and family gather in private home settings, which could be cause for alarm ahead of the winter months and the Thanksgiving holiday. ├втВм┼УWhat we├втВмтДвre seeing as the increasing threat right now is actually acquisition of infection through small household gatherings. And particularly with Thanksgiving coming up, we think it├втВмтДвs really important to stress the vigilance of these continued mitigation steps in the household setting,├втВм┬Э US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield told the nation├втВмтДвs governors in a conference call Tuesday, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN.  That messaging was communicated in reports released from the task force to each state this week. The White House has declined to make the reports public but CNN has obtained reports from several states. For example, reports for Vermont, Washington and Delaware warned against community transmission ├втВм┼Уin smaller gatherings of family and friends where masking and social distancing recommendations are not followed,├втВм┬Э recommending ├втВм┼Уincreased messaging regarding the need to take these measures, especially given the element of prevention ├втВм╦Ьfatigue.├втВмтДв├втВм┬Э The task force warned New Mexico that ├втВм┼Уpeople must remember that seemingly uninfected family members and friends may be infected but asymptomatic,├втВм┬Э which ├втВм┼Уcan easily lead to spread as people unmask in private gatherings.├втВм┬Э And the task force told Pennsylvania and Utah: ├втВм┼УRecent data suggest that smaller, more intimate gatherings of family, friends and neighbors are driving infection, especially as activities move indoors and adherence to face covering and social distancing wanes.├втВм┬Э Based on the reports obtained by CNN, there are at least 26 states in the task force-defined ├втВм┼Уred zone├втВм┬Э for new cases, meaning more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population. A report for Vermont reflected that no state is currently in the task force-defined ├втВм┼Уgreen zone├втВм┬Э for cases. With between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population, Vermont, which has the ├втВм┼Уlowest rate in the country,├втВм┬Э now falls into the ├втВм┼Уyellow zone.├втВм┬Э The task force also sounded the alarms about the possibility of an outbreak in the Northeast region. Vermont has been ├втВм┼Уextraordinarily successful,├втВм┬Э the task force said, but added there is still cause for concern. The task force warned Ohio and New Mexico of reemerging spread, telling Ohio it is ├втВм┼Уshowing early signs of reemergence of significant community spread.├втВм┬Э Utah, home to the fifth-highest new case rate in the nation, was warned that the state├втВмтДвs ├втВм┼Уincidence and test positivity are the highest they have ever been, but restrictions are low to minimal across the state.├втВм┬Э ├втВм┼УClear mitigation policies with effective implementation are critically important, especially in areas with increasing incidence,├втВм┬Э the Utah report said. Idaho, which has the sixth-highest new case rate, was told to have schools take steps to avoid what it described as ├втВм┼УCovid-19 stigma.├втВм┬Э They included: ├втВм┼У(Addressing) Covid-19 stigma related to responsibility for school closing by emphasizing consequences of Covid-19 (morbidity and mortality), posting hospitalization and mortality data on local and state websites, posting local trends in incidence and test positivity by age group (to show how transmission starts in the young and expands to older populations) and encouraging community cohesion and civic responsibility in local messaging.├втВм┬Э The task force encouraged Idaho school districts to ├втВм┼Уdeploy specific messaging on COVID-19 risks and strategies to avoid infection targeted to older individuals and those at risk for more severe disease.├втВм┬Э And in Missouri, which still does not have a statewide mask mandate in place, the task force said community spread continues, in both rural and urban settings. ├втВм┼УMitigation efforts should increase to include mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding crowds in public and social gatherings in private to stop the increasing spread among residents of Missouri,├втВм┬Э the report said. The task force also cautioned that there are ├втВм┼Уsevere outbreaks├втВм┬Э among nursing home residents and staff in Missouri. ├В┬й 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

Irked by the move, more Nigerians trooped to the streets, calling for the rejection of the new unit.

Fake news you can trust, delivered straight to your inbox. WASHINGTON, D.C.├втВмтАЭThe media is scratching their heads today after thousands of angry Trump supporters descended on the capital and were completely peaceful throughout the entire demonstration. ""I don't even know what this is. This is really confusing,"" said D.C. correspondent Cork Dorgen. ""We've seen violent protests and mostly-peaceful protests, but this protest seems all-the-way peaceful and we didn't even know that was a thing."" According to witnesses, a crowd of hundreds of thousands of people peacefully marched while waving flags, singing the National Anthem, and proclaiming their love for the country and the president. Media outlets in turn have condemned the march as ""physically peaceful, but morally violent."" According to several reports, demonstrators were seen wearing shirts with violent and triggering patriotic messages. One reporter witnessed a high-schooler in a MAGA hat smirking very violently at him. ""While we didn't see physical violence here today, we heard violent speech, violent ideas, and violent singing. These people are basically violent,"" said CNN reporter Jim Acosta. ""If they are not stopped, they may violently stop watching news from trusted sources like CNN or violently expose corruption in Joe Biden's administration."" Reporters were even more horrified when it was revealed that 92% of the crowd was planning to violently attend church services and violently sing hymns the next day in spite of the pandemic.

With her vibrant pink hair and signature specs, Seraphine is about as unique as they come in terms of Champions. If a fictional character was based on you, we're pretty sure you'd know about it - but when it comes to ""Stephanie"", she thinks the character has stolen her likeness. Posting on Medium, Stephanie explained her personal journey and why Seraphine is a problematic newcomer to LoL. The crux of the matter goes back to Stephanie's brief relationship with a Riot Games employee in 2019. She's confident this led to her likeness being used to create the K/DA pop princess. In the lengthy story, Stephanie spoke about her relationship with ""John"". She explained, the pair had a mutual love of LoL, while John came up with Stephanie-inspired skin ideas for her favourite character, Ahri. She said she visited the Riot Games studio and was given artist drawings of herself as Ahri, which she said was ""strange"". She continued to claim John wanted her to provide the voice for a top-secret project which she thinks was Seraphine. Despite her and John going their separate ways, Stephanie said she was shocked to see Seraphine's reveal (which was also the same day as her birthday). Stephanie said, ""As soon as I saw what she looked like and realised she was going to be a League champion, I started scrolling through her accounts, completely freaked out. My worries only grew, and my heart sank more and more with every post"". Stephanie went on to point out how a lot of her poses seem to match Seraphine and how she thinks her cat was the inspiration for Seraphine's. Instead of putting the blame at John's door, she's instead pointing at Riot. She concluded, ""It's a quaint idea, but when you think about it more closely, the idea of a marketing team in some office in Los Angeles trying to sell a product by coming up with the most ~relatable~ and marketable things to tweet out of the account of a 'girl' who coincidentally looks like me, and talks like me, and sounds like me, and draws like me? It just makes me sick"". Despite having ""no way to conclusively prove"" Seraphine is based on her, Stephanie is standing by her story. Is there more to this twisted tale though? Stephanie's accusations have caught the attention of Riot Games, which has now issued a statement on the matter.  Despite some thinking there's a lot to Stephanie's claims, Riot maintains there's nothing untoward going on. A Riot spokesperson told PC Gamer, ""Seraphine was independently created by Riot Games and was not based on any individual. Additionally, the former employee [Stephanie] is referring to left Riot more than a year ago and was in a department and role that has no input whatsoever into the creative design process"". In October, Senior Game Designer Jeevun Sidhu cited that his wife was the main influence for Seraphine. Also, last month, Stephanie's lawyer sent a legal demand to Riot Games. The defence has said Stephanie's claim ├втВм┼Уlacks merit├втВм┬Э and has invited her side to ├втВм┼Уfurther discuss the facts"". While Stephanie thinks Seraphine is based on her, Riot is sticking to its guns and is adamant this is just a simple coincidence.

9390,Top DOJ official resigns in protest after AG Barr authorized voting irregularity investigation ├втА╣тАа American Wire,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since President Trump lost support between 2016 and 2020 in most of the areas where he held rallies in the final weeks of the election campaign, according to an NBC analysis of his campaign stops. NBC News analysed Trump's 30 campaign stops made in the two weeks before the final Election Day on November 3 before Biden was projected to have defeated the sitting president by 306 electoral college votes to 232. In 25 of the counties Trump visited, he achieved a smaller margin of victory than in 2016 or lost the county altogether, and he achieved a bigger margin of victory in just 5, NBC reported. The data does not prove whether the campaign stops had a net positive effect or whether his margin of defeat would have been even greater in those counties had he not made those stops at all. However, it does call into question parallel drawn by Trump and his supporters between the size of his rallies and his performance in the election. Campaign figures including Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, have claimed without evidence that the size of Trump rallies provide evidence that Biden was unlikely to have won the election. ""I think it's very hard for people to rationalize that a guy like Joe Biden ├втВмтАЭ who could barely scrape together 12 people to go to a campaign event for him, you know, even a couple of weeks ago ├втВмтАЭ suddenly somehow got around 80 million votes,"" said Lara Trump in November. ""Donald Trump gained 10 million votes from 2016. We all were out working across the country hard. You saw that tens of thousands of people would come to Trump events and then, like, 12 to 20 people showing up to a Joe Biden event,"" she said. The president on Sunday tweeted ""NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION!"" in reference to a video showing a large presence at one of his rallies. The Trump campaign has failed to produce evidence to substantiate its claims of widespread voter fraud in the election. Multiple lawsuits filed by the president's lawyers which contested the election's outcome have also been unsuccessful. The president, who held dozens of rallies throughout this year despite the coronavirus pandemic, told crowds on several occasions during the campaign that he was only holding the rallies because he believed they would boost his vote count. He told a crowd in Michigan at one such rally in October that ├втВмтАЭ were it not for the pandemic ├втВмтАЭ he would not have been forced to speak to the assembled crowd of supporters. ""I probably wouldn't be standing out here in the freezing rain with you. I'd be home in the White House, doing whatever the hell I was doing. I wouldn't be out here,"" he told the audience in Ingham County, Michigan. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before Biden flipped the state back this year. Trump's margin of defeat in Ingham County went on to increase from 27% to 32%, per NBC. The president made similar comments during a campaign rally in Erie County, Pennsylvania ├втВмтАЭ a key swing county in a battleground state ├втВмтАЭ earlier in October. ""Four or five months ago when we started this whole thing ├втВмтАЭ because, you know, before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I have to be honest, there's no way I was coming."" Trump went onto lose the state by 1 point, having won it by 1.6 points in 2016, per NBC. He also lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes. Campaign figures including Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, have claimed without evidence that the size of Trump rallies provide evidence that Biden was unlikely to have won the election.",1,1,0,0

9520,Hundreds march through Brighton in anti-lockdown protest,"By Nomalanga Tshuma Nov 20, 2020 Share this article: Cape Town - ├втВм┼УI don├втВмтДвt mind dying for my country and what I believe in.├втВм┬Э This is according to the man who was arrested at the EFF protest on Friday. Despite numerous calls for Brackenfell residents to not engage with EFF protesters during their protest on Friday in the community, a white resident made his way to the front of the EFF├втВмтДвs makeshift stage in the middle of Frans Conradie and allegedly hurled racial slurs and profanities at the crowd while the party├втВмтДвs general secretary, Marshall Dlamini, was speaking. EFF members responded to the provocation by beating and stomping on the man as he lay screaming at their feet. He was rescued by the police a few minutes later. Police called on the crowd to disperse, which was met with some resistance at first and quickly turned around as the police began firing rubber bullets, throwing stun grenades, released tear gas and utilised water cannon trucks. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: ├втВм┼УOne member of the public was injured after he attempted to disrupt the EFF protest. He was arrested on the scene on a charge of incitement and is also due in court in due course.├втВм┬Э The injured resident said that he had decided to set the EFF crowd straight after their continuous calls for white people to be done away with. He said: ├втВм┼УI am willing to die for my country. What the EFF are saying and doing here is wrong. South Africa is for all who live in it regardless of race and culture. Both Afrikaans people and black people belong here, and I had to let them know that.├втВм┬Э Meanwhile, a few metres away, dispersing protesters began throwing rocks and sticks in retaliation at police officers and law enforcement, vandalising a few businesses, private vehicles and state vehicles, as well as setting alight open fields in the community and surrounding areas. Van Wyk said: ├втВм┼УThe protest action in Brackenfell necessitated police action to maintain law and to disperse the riotous crowd. Eight protestors were arrested on charges of public violence and they are due in court once they have been charged. ├втВм┼УAs the protesters dispersed, they were throwing stones at all Law Enforcement agencies as well as businesses. Several SAPS, Law Enforcement vehicles, windows of businesses as well as private vehicles were damaged. ├втВм┼УThe crowd has since dispersed but the situation in the area is still being monitored. Our forces will remain in the area until we are satisfied that the situation has stabilised.├втВм┬Э Police and some @EFFSouthAfrica members clash in #Brackenfell.#effinbrakenfell#BrackenfellHighSchool├░┼╕тАЬ┬╣ @PJikelo / @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/P549Kjg54F Cape Argus Share this article: Sections on IOL Follow IOL More on IOL Legal Trending on IOL Newspapers ├В┬й 2021 Independent Online and affiliated companies.

9547,Thailand protests: clashes cause chaos outside parliament,"Penguin Random House Canada├втВмтДвs plans to publish a new work by the ├втВм╦Ьprofessor against political correctness├втВмтДв has reportedly prompted numerous complaints Last modified on Thu 21 Jan 2021 11.16 EST The announcement of a new book from Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, the self-styled ├втВм┼Уprofessor against political correctness├втВм┬Э, has prompted dozens of complaints from staff at his publisher in Canada, according to a report. Vice├втВмтДвs story on Tuesday said that the announcement of Peterson├втВмтДвs forthcoming Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, a follow-up to his global bestseller 12 Rules for Life, prompted ├втВм┼Уseveral├втВм┬Э staff at Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) to confront management. Peterson├втВмтДвs views on subjects including transgender rights, gender and race have been controversial. Last year, Cambridge University rescinded its offer of a visiting fellowship to Peterson. Also in 2019, 12 Rules for Life was temporarily pulled from sale in a New Zealand book chain after the terrorist attack on a Christchurch mosque, over perceived links between Peterson├втВмтДвs fanbase and Islamophobia.  At a PRH Canada town hall meeting on Monday, one employee told Vice, ├втВм┼Уpeople were crying about how Jordan Peterson has affected their lives├втВм┬Э. PRH Canada├втВмтДвs diversity and inclusion committee reportedly received at least 70 anonymous messages about Peterson├втВмтДвs book from staff, with only ├втВм┼Уa couple├втВм┬Э in favour of the decision to publish. In response, PRH Canada told Vice that it ├втВм┼Уimmediately├втВм┬Э held the forum after announcing its plans to publish Beyond Order and ├втВм┼Уprovided a space for our employees to express their views and offer feedback├втВм┬Э. The publisher├втВмтДвs statement said: ├втВм┼УOur employees have started an anonymous feedback channel, which we fully support. We are open to hearing our employees├втВмтДв feedback and answering all of their questions. We remain committed to publishing a range of voices and viewpoints.├втВм┬Э Peterson├втВмтДвs daughter Mikhaila tweeted a link to the Vice article. ├втВм┼УHow to improve business in 2 steps: Step 1: identify crying adults. Step 2: fire,├втВм┬Э she wrote. ├втВм┼УIf you don├втВмтДвt think adults willing to cry to get their way in a workplace is a problem ├втВм┬ж you├втВмтДвre clearly not in charge of many people.├втВм┬Э Peterson├втВмтДвs Beyond Order, which is due out in March, promises to deliver ├втВм┼У12 more lifesaving principles for resisting the exhausting toll that our desire to order the world inevitably takes├втВм┬Э. ├втВм┼УIn a time when the human will increasingly imposes itself over every sphere of life ├втВмтАЬ from our social structures to our emotional states ├втВмтАЬ Peterson warns that too much security is dangerous,├втВм┬Э says the publisher. ├втВм┼УWhat├втВмтДвs more, he offers strategies for overcoming the cultural, scientific, and psychological forces causing us to tend toward tyranny, and teaches us how to rely instead on our instinct to find meaning and purpose, even ├втВмтАЬ and especially ├втВмтАЬ when we find ourselves powerless.├втВм┬Э The Guardian understands that no staff at PRH in the UK have complained about the decision to publish Peterson again. The protests in Canada over Peterson├втВмтДвs book follow Hachette├втВмтДвs decision to drop Woody Allen├втВмтДвs memoir after a staff walkout, and reports that staff at JK Rowling├втВмтДвs publisher in the UK were told they could not refuse to work on her new children├втВмтДвs book The Ickabog because they disagreed with her views on transgender rights. This article was amended on 21 January 2021 to remove a statement that the offer to Jordan Peterson was rescinded ├втВм┼Уfollowing criticism from faculty and students├втВм┬Э. Cambridge University has informed the Guardian that the decision was made by the Research Committee of the Faculty of Divinity prior to and independently of the receipt of any external comment on the matter by other university staff or students.",1,3,0,0
9593,End SARS: I will lead next protest ├втВмтАЬ Oluwo - Daily Post Nigeria,"CHANNELS TELEVISION Advertisement  The Nigerian Army has insisted that only blank bullets containing gunpowder were fired at the Lekki Tollgate area of Lagos State on October 20. Commander of the 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo, made this known on Saturday when he appeared before the Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up by the state government to investigate cases of police brutality. He also insisted that the military only fired into the air and not directly at the #EndSARS protesters. While explaining that the blank bullets used cannot cause any damage to the flesh, Brigadier Taiwo said if real bullets were indeed fired, one bullet had the potency to kill three persons at one shot.    RELATED: Reports Of Army Searching For DJ Switch ├втВм╦ЬFurther From The Truth├втВмтДв ├втВмтАЬ Brigadier Taiwo Nigerian Army Denies Shooting Protesters, Says Lagos Govt Requested Military Intervention  He reiterated the Army├втВмтДвs position that they were deployed to the scene on the orders of the state government. While a curfew had been put in place to contain the violence that had broken out in parts of the state by persons who hijacked the peaceful protests, the army said it did not get the update that the timing which had initially been set to commence at 4:00 pm, was shifted to 9:00 pm. Brigadier General Taiwo also maintained that the troops were not only deployed to the Lekki tollgate but also to other areas like Badagry, Ikorodu, Apapa, Alimosho, Epe, Lagos Island and the entire state to restore normalcy. Furthermore, he claimed that after the soldiers left the area, hoodlums went on to destroy the toll gate plaza. Watch Full Video Below   The army had initially described reports of its involvement in the shooting as fake news before admitting to being present at the scene. Viral reports online had insinuated that not only were they present, but they shot at and killed several persons and allegedly hid the bodies. Both the army and the state government have, however faulted the reports, insisting that only two persons had been confirmed dead from the incident. ├втВм┼УTwo dead bodies.

9608,Trump visits Michigan voters in first of five Sunday rallies,"Skirmishes break out between rival groups as police fire water cannon and MPs flee in boats Last modified on Tue 17 Nov 2020 23.36 EST Thailand├втВмтДвs riverside parliament was surrounded by chaos as police repeatedly fired water cannon at pro-democracy protesters, clashes broke out between the demonstrators and royalist counterparts, and MPs abandoned the scene in boats. Five people were treated for gunshot wounds, including at least two students, after the most violent clashes since a youth-led movement emerged in July. A total of 55 people suffered injuries in the protests, according to Bangkok├втВмтДвs Erawan emergency medical centre.  For months, a youth-led protest movement has held escalating demonstrations calling for democratic reforms. They have demanded the removal of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general, and have breached longstanding taboos to call for an accountable and transparent monarchy. Dozens have faced legal charges for taking part in the rallies. On Tuesday, as lawmakers considered whether to debate several proposals to amend the constitution ├втВмтАЬ an issue central to protesters├втВмтДв demands ├втВмтАЬ thousands gathered outside the Thai parliament, which had been blocked off with razor wire and concrete. Protesters outside parliament mocked the military-backed government by bringing giant inflatable ducks to the rally, which some joked would float down the river to an otherwise inaccessible parliament. The ducks, nicknamed by some as their ├втВм┼Уnavy force├втВм┬Э, were instead used to shelter from blasts of water cannon, which in some instances contained chemical irritants. Teargas was also used on pro-democracy protesters, who wore hard hats and goggles for protection. Groups of demonstrators could be seen coughing and pouring water over their faces to ease the stinging. ├втВм┼УStop accusing us of violating the law, you [the police] are violating the law by hurting people,├втВм┬Э Parit Chiwarak, a prominent student leader also known as Penguin, said through a megaphone later in the evening. ├втВм┼УWe are fighting for a better future of our country and for everyone so don├втВмтДвt fire water cannon on us.├втВм┬Э A police spokesman said water cannon were used because protesters were attempting to break into a restricted area. Despite a heavy police presence around parliament, skirmishes broke out between royalists, who wore yellow shirts, and pro-democracy protesters during the afternoon. Both sides threw stones and water bottles after police retreated from one of the barricades, the first major clash between royalists and the student-led movement. Skirmishes occurred again later in the evening, when gunshots were fired. In one video, shared widely on social media and apparently filmed among yellow shirt royalists, a speaker warns the opposing side to control their crowd, and not to throw a firecracker. What sounds like several gunshots are fired. A person close to the camera, far from the front line, watches on saying ├втВм┼Уshoot them, shoot them├втВм┬Э. Mint Suttawan, an MP for the progressive opposition party Move Forward, told the Guardian she had visited two injured students at Rama 9 hospital. Both had been shot in the leg but were conscious, she said. They had attended the demonstration as protest guards for the pro-democracy movement ├втВмтАЬ volunteers who stand on the front line to manage the crowds and ensure demonstrators├втВмтДв safety. Royalists held a counter-demonstration earlier in the day, where they urged lawmakers not to change the constitution. ├втВм┼УAmending the constitution is going to lead to the abolition of the monarchy,├втВм┬Э the royalist leader, Warong Dechgitvigrom, told reporters. Protesters have said they do not want abolition of the monarchy, but believe it should be brought under the constitution. They have also called for the removal of harsh defamation laws that protect the royal family from criticism. Anyone who ├втВм┼Уdefames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir apparent or regent├втВм┬Э can face up to 15 years in prison. Strict l├Г┬иse majest├Г┬й laws make it a crime to criticise, defame or insult members of Thailand's royal family. In practice, this means open discussion or critical reporting about the royal family is considered illegal. The military junta, which seized power in 2014, has been criticised for using the law ├втВмтАЬ which can see people jailed for up to 15 years on each count ├втВмтАЬ to stifle opposition. In 2015, a man was jailed for 30 years over six Facebook posts and the local printer of the New York Times refused to publish an edition with a story on the king. Surrounded by the unrest, several MPs and senators left parliament in the afternoon on boats from a pier behind the building. On Wednesday they are expected to vote on which, if any, of seven constitutional amendment bills should be debated. The most controversial, which aims to undo the changes introduced under military rule, has been put forward by the human rights NGO iLaw. It says the 250 military-appointed senators should be replaced with elected officials, and does not, like other proposals, prevent changes to parts of the constitution that relate to the monarchy. However, despite receiving about 100,000 signatures it is unlikely to pass. The royal palace has not responded to the protests, although the king has said of demonstrators ├втВм┼Уwe love them all the same├втВм┬Э. In recent comments, he described Thailand as the ├втВм┼Уland of compromise├втВм┬Э.",0,0,0,0

President Trump made an appeal to voters in Michigan Sunday ├втВмтАЭ kicking off the first of a marathon five rallies planned for the day. The president addressed a crowd of supporters at the Michigan Sports Stars Park in Washington, where he touted the US economy and bashed his Democratic rival Joe Biden├втВмтДвs policy proposals. ├втВм┼УJoe Biden will shut down your economy,├втВм┬Э Trump said. Speaking outdoors in windy 39-degree weather, the president quipped that he might need to borrow a better jacket from members of the crowd. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs really a contest to see whether we can all stand it,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УAnd we├втВмтДвre loving it.├втВм┬Э Trump also recalled being at a concert where Italian opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti refused to sing because he was uncomfortable ├втВмтАЭ but said he wouldn├втВмтДвt leave over the chilly weather because, ├втВм┼УI├втВмтДвm not a diva.├втВм┬Э Speaking about coronavirus lockdowns, Trump took aim at Michigan Gov.

9730,Ilhan Omar Likens Trump Rallies to 'Klan Rallies' - Washington Free Beacon,"Dozens of demonstrators converged outside the Echo Park home of Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Sunday afternoon to express their displeasure with a new round of COVID-19 restrictions that will take effect Monday. Carrying signs and waving flags, the protesters called on Ferrer to ├втВм┼УOpen L.A.├втВм┬Э and chanted, ├втВм┼УNo science. No data. No shutdown.├втВм┬Э Few of the 50 or so demonstrators were wearing face masks. More people here now, and a bit of a shouting match erupting between the protesters and a resident on this street. pic.twitter.com/SQ6YYZ2FcB   The county├втВмтДвs latest Safer at Home order was announced Tuesday amid an alarming increase in coronavirus cases and COVID-19 deaths. Its slew of restrictions includes a ban on most gatherings, stricter limits on retail businesses, and closures of playgrounds that aren├втВмтДвt part of a school or childcare center. The order will be in effect for three weeks, until Dec. 20. Those restrictions came on the heels of a previously announced rule that suspended outdoor dining at restaurants throughout most of the county. Pasadena, which has its own health department, opted to allow outdoor dining to continue. In addition, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced a statewide curfew that forbids nonessential gatherings with members of other households between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The recent restrictions have drawn the ire of business owners, exhausted parents and others who are simply losing patience with the pandemic way of life. One of the protesters outside Ferrer├втВмтДвs home carried a sign that read, ├втВм┼УNewsom and Ferrer are non-essential.├втВм┬Э Another shouted, ├втВм┼УHow dare you take away our guns and lock us in?├втВм┬Э California L.A. County├втВмтДвs new stay-home order is the strictest in California. Here├втВмтДвs how it works Los Angeles County has issued a new COVID-19 pandemic order in a desperate move aimed at slowing an unprecedented surge of coronavirus infections.   Some of the demonstrators raised other grievances, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Several people brought Trump flags, and one held a sign that declared ├втВм┼УTrump won.├втВм┬Э Several people got into heated exchanges with Ferrer├втВмтДвs neighbors, including one resident who called the protesters ├втВм┼Уfascists├втВм┬Э and Nazis.├втВм┬Э Though noisy at times, the protest remained peaceful until the demonstrators dispersed around 5 p.m. California Photos: Gov. Newsom announces new stay-at-home order as COVID-19 hospitalizations hit record Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced a stay-at-home order affecting most of California.   A Los Angeles Police Department vehicle was parked in Ferrer├втВмтДвs shared driveway to monitor the protest. LAPD officials could not be reached for comment Sunday night. For the most part, L.A. County residents have taken heed of the public health orders intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the community. But patience is wearing thin, and some people have become more vocal in opposing them. The county is now averaging nearly 4,200 new coronavirus cases each day, a tally that exceeds the number of daily cases reported during the summer. Hospitalizations have been on the rise for the past two weeks and are now just shy of 2,200, nearly meeting the previous high from the summer. Over the last week, L.A. County has averaged nearly 28 COVID-19 deaths each day. Times staff writers David Zahniser and Laura Nelson contributed to this report.

9764,"Trump supporters protest outside vote centers in Arizona, Michigan","KTLA by: Associated Press Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of killing two protesters days after Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wis. (Antioch Police Department via AP) A 17-year-old from Illinois who is charged with killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin and whose case has become a rallying cry for some conservatives posted $2 million bail Friday and was released from custody. Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz during a demonstration Aug. 25 that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. He posted bond through his attorney at about 2 p.m., Kenosha County Sheriff├втВмтДвs Sgt. David Wright said. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense. He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesn├втВмтДвt permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they├втВмтДвre hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing. His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for him has attracted millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September. Huber├втВмтДвs father, John Huber, asked Kenosha County Circuit Court Commissioner Loren Keating during a hearing Nov. 2 to set Rittenhouse├втВмтДвs bail between $4 million and $10 million. Huber said Rittenhouse thinks he├втВмтДвs above the law and noted the effort to raise money on his behalf. He also suggested militia groups would hide him from police if he were released. Rittenhouse├втВмтДвs attorney, Mark Richards, asked for $750,000 bail. Keating ultimately set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse was a flight risk given the seriousness of the charges against him. Submit Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

9788,Dozens protest in Jefferson City in support of President Trump,"ADVERTISEMENT SHARE Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) likened President Donald Trump's campaign rallies to Ku Klux Klan rallies in a Monday interview with the Washington Post. Trump ""chose to speak about me at every single rally, didn't really matter where he was, sometimes multiple times in a day, as he held his Klan rallies across the country,"" Omar said to Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart. Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as ""the Squad,"" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as ""a four-year assault"" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party ""isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, ""the Squad"" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) quoted a Klansman to criticize Trump's national security policies in a tweet last year, and failed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared Trump's rallies to Nazi meetings.

9872,"Cricket news: Australia vs India third ODI, Ian Chappell says Glenn Maxwell switch hitting unfair, visitors should protest","NewsNation Now Alexa Mencia PHOENIX (NewsNation Now) ├втВмтАЭ Crowds of supporters for President Donald Trump gathered outside vote centers in Arizona and Michigan Wednesday, expressing concerns about the counting of ballots. In Phoenix, roughly 100 protesters converged in front of the Maricopa County Elections Department, chanting ├втВм┼УStop the steal!├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼УCount my vote.├втВм┬Э Many were without masks and some were armed with rifles and handguns. The rally comes as The Associated Press has declared Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the winner in Arizona, flipping a state that has a long political history of voting Republican. Trump had won Arizona in 2016. The AP called the race early Wednesday morning, after an analysis of ballots concluded that there weren├втВмтДвt enough outstanding to allow Trump to catch up. Gilbert resident Chris Michael, 40, joined protesters outside the Maricopa County Elections Department Wednesday night. Michael told Reuters that he came to make sure all votes are counted.

Period.├втВм┬Э Observers from both major political parties were inside the election center as ballots were processed and counted, and the procedure was live-streamed online at all times. Several sheriff├втВмтДвs deputies blocked the entrance to the building. The vote-counting carried on into the night, Maricopa County Elections Department spokeswoman Megan Gilbertson said. Two top county officials ├втВмтАЭ one a Democrat, the other a Republican ├втВмтАЭ issued a statement expressing concern about how misinformation had spread about the integrity of the election process. ├втВм┼УEveryone should want all the votes to be counted, whether they were mailed or cast in person,├втВм┬Э said the statement signed by Clint Hickman, the GOP chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Democratic Supervisor Steve Gallardo. ├втВм┼УAn accurate vote takes time. ├втВм┬ж This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.├втВм┬Э In Detroit, Trump supporters gathered by a ballot-tallying center shortly before The Associated Press declared that Biden had won Michigan. Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Center and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the counting area. They chanted ├втВм┼УStop the count!├втВм┬Э and ├втВм┼УStop the vote!├втВм┬Э Earlier, Trump├втВмтДвs campaign filed a lawsuit in a bid to halt the count, demanding Michigan├втВмтДвs Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the voting and the counting. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying ├втВм┼Уusing a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately.├втВм┬Э The Trump campaign also filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Georgia Wednesday, laying the groundwork for contesting the battleground states as he slipped behind Biden. The new filings, joining existing Republican legal challenges in Pennsylvania and Nevada, demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and absentee ballot concerns, the campaign said. Protests were also reported in other areas of the country, including in Portland, where a riot was declared Wednesday. Many took to the streets in Seattle and New York City overnight, as well.

Ian Chappell wants shots like this from Glenn Maxwell outlawed.Source:Getty Images It├втВмтДвs only taken two one-dayers for Ian Chappell├втВмтДвs first angry rant of the summer. The former Australian captain has unloaded his frustration at batting tactics employed by Glenn Maxwell and David Warner he believes are blatantly unfair. Maxwell in particular is one of the finest exponents of switch-hitting, where a batsman faces up in his normal position before moving his feet ├втВмтАЬ and sometimes altering his grip ├втВмтАЬ to effectively swap his stance. Chappell conceded it was ├втВм┼Уamazingly skilful├втВм┬Э but insisted it wasn├втВмтДвt fair on the bowler after two run-fests at the SCG to open the series. ├втВм┼УHow can one side of the game, ie. the bowlers, they have to tell the umpire how they├втВмтДвre going to bowl. And yet the batsman, he lines up as a right-hander ├втВмтАЬ I├втВмтДвm the fielding captain, I place the field for the right-hander ├втВмтАЬ and before the ball├втВмтДвs been delivered, the batsman becomes a left-hander,├втВм┬Э Chappell told nine.com.au. ├втВм┼УOne of the main reasons why he├втВмтДвs becoming a left-hander is so he can take advantage of those field placings. I├втВмтДвd love the administrators who made those laws, I├втВмтДвd love them to explain to me how that├втВмтДвs fair.├втВм┬Э Chappell encouraged India to revolt against the practice by challenging the on-field umpire. ├втВм┼УI just can├втВмтДвt believe the players don├втВмтДвt arc-up about it. If I├втВмтДвm captain, I├втВмтДвm going to take the ball myself and I├втВмтДвm going to tell the umpire I├втВмтДвm bowling right-arm over [the wicket], and then I├втВмтДвm going to run in and bowl around,├втВм┬Э he said. ├втВм┼УObviously the umpire├втВм╦Ьs going to complain and I├втВмтДвm going to say, ├втВмтДвWell, you stop him (the batsman) doing something I think is totally unfair and I├втВмтДвll stop doing something unfair├втВмтДв. If the administrators aren├втВмтДвt smart enough to change it, then my attitude always was, ├втВм╦ЬWell, I├втВмтДвll take the law into my own hands├втВмтДв.├втВм┬Э Glenn Maxwell positions himself for a switch hit. (Photo by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images)Source:Getty Images Chappell suggested a solution to the problem that wouldn├втВмтДвt result in the tactic being completely lost from the game. ├втВм┼УIt├втВмтДвs very simple ├втВм┬ж All you├втВмтДвve got to say is that if the batsman changes the order of his hands or his feet [as the bowler runs in], then it├втВмтДвs an illegal shot,├втВм┬Э Chappell said. ├втВм┼У(But) if the batsman├втВмтДвs right-handed and wants to play switch-hit [in advance of the bowler running in], any bowler worth his salt will say, ├втВм╦ЬGo for your life, mate, I├втВмтДвll take my chances├втВмтДв. But when he completely becomes the opposite-handed batsman to what he faces up as, then it├втВмтДвs not fair. ├втВм┼УIf he├втВмтДвs good enough to do it by excellent footwork or whatever other means he can devise, I don├втВмтДвt have a problem with it.

8,Asian American super PAC endorses Joe Biden,"Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden picked up an endorsement on Friday from a super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian American and Pacific Islander voters. тАЬWe believe that Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat Trump and lead our country,тАЭ Shekar Narasimhan, chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund, said in a statement. тАЬOut of all the presidential candidates, he has the most experience and cares deeply about AAPI issues.тАЭ The group says it will spend $2 million on Asian American and Pacific Islander outreach this election season. A super PAC, like the AAPI Victory Fund, can accept unlimited contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals, but are independent and prohibited from coordinating most communications with a candidate committee. The fundтАЩs endorsement of the former vice president comes less than two months before CaliforniaтАЩs early primary on March 3. Asian Americans could play an important role in that contest, as they account for roughly one of every six registered voters in the state, according to AAPI Data. Biden and fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., were neck and neck for favorability among Asian American and Pacific Islander eligible voters in the Golden State, according to the results of a survey conducted last year in part by AAPI Data. In the last presidential election, the AAPI Victory Fund endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, ahead of the California primary held in June 2016. Greg Schultz, Biden For President campaign manager, welcomed the fundтАЩs 2020 endorsement. тАЬTime and time again, Joe Biden has proven himself to be the only candidate who can build the broad diverse coalition necessary to defeat Donald Trump,тАЭ he told NBC News in an emailed statement. тАЬWith the AAPI Victory FundтАЩs support, we are one step closer to doing just that.тАЭ For this yearтАЩs election, the super PAC expects the Asian American and Pacific Islander electorate to play a decisive role in battleground states including Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Arizona. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have tried to win over Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, who accounted for just over 4 percent of the electorate in the last presidential election. ItтАЩs a voting bloc thatтАЩs part of the fastest growing racial group and is expected to double by 2040. ItтАЩs also one thatтАЩs potentially up for grabs, with nearly two in five Asian-American registered voters not identifying as either a Democrat or Republican, according to the 2018 Asian American Voter Survey, conducted by a number of nonprofits. Narasimhan said the AAPI Victory Fund made its endorsement of Biden тАЬwith enormous respect for the three AAPI candidates and others who entered the presidential race.тАЭ тАЬThere is still a tremendous amount of work to be done in the next 10 months, and AAPIs are more engaged than ever,тАЭ he added. тАЬWe are committed to continuing our work for 2020 victories and delivering one million new voters for Joe Biden to win the Presidency and for Democrats to increase their House majority and to take back the Senate.тАЭ Chris Fuchs is a freelance journalist based in New York.

12,"New census ads speak to Filipino, Vietnamese, other undercounted Asian American groups","Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News The Census Bureau has begun rolling out ads in multiple languages to encourage people in hard-to-reach communities to participate in the congressionally mandated headcount тАФ part of an effort that comes as many Asian Americans still fear that the questionnaire will ask them about their citizenship status. ""The 2020 Census is your census, and its success depends on you,тАЭ Steven Dillingham, director of the Census Bureau, said in a statement this week. TDW+Co, the official Asian American outreach and communications partner of the Census Bureau, is one of 13 agencies tasked with creating ads for the bureauтАЩs $500 million public education and outreach campaign. Advertisements will appear in Asian languages including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese. The effort will focus on television and radio commercials, digital, social media, print advertising and messaging on billboards and at bus stops. Tim Wang, founder and principal of TDW+Co, said barriers faced by the Asian American community, such as having the least familiarity with and knowledge of the census and why itтАЩs important, were the primary drivers of their advertising campaign. тАЬWe kept our hard-to-count populations in mind тАФ those who are foreign-born or who live in households where English is not the primary language тАФ and developed culturally relevant Asian advertising materials to educate, raise awareness and encourage our communities to participate in the census this year,тАЭ Wang told NBC News in an email. Conducted every 10 years, the census is used to decide the number of seats awarded to states in the House of Representatives, how representative boundaries are drawn, and how more than $675 billion a year in federal funds is distributed. ItтАЩs also used in determining which states and counties are required to provide voter language assistance according to the Voting Rights Act. An inaccurate count could affect these outcomes. Concerns remain that a citizenship question might appear on the census, despite a Supreme Court decision in June that ruled otherwise. Asian Americans are least likely to fill out the census form тАФ and most concerned their answers will be used against them тАФ according to a survey released in January 2019 by the Census Bureau. Community advocates have also expressed concern that Asian Americans could be undercounted in the 2020 census, including in the Midwest, which has seen some of the fastest rates of Asian American growth in the last decade. The Census Bureau said its public education and outreach campaign will convey the importance of completing the census, and will include more than 1,000 ads that are intended to reach 99 percent of U.S. households. Ads targeting multicultural and historically undercounted groups were unveiled on Tuesday, while those geared toward a general audience will roll out in mid-February. Beginning in mid-March, people can respond to the census online, by phone or by mail. In addition to the Asian languages, ads will also appear in English, Arabic, French, Haitian Creole, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. тАЬWe are extremely committed to reaching those people who are historically undercounted,тАЭ Dillingham said. тАЬToday, we will demonstrate how the тАШShape your Future.

49,Are Asian Americans White? Or People of Color?,"Borrowing from W. E. B. Du BoisтАЩ color-line metaphor, some racial justice activists have asked whether Asian Americans are тАЬleft or right of the color line.тАЭ How we answer these questions bears important implications for movements for racial justice and equity. These are also questions that we have both confronted as womxn who are a second-generation queer Punjabi American and a second-generation Hong Konger American. No, Asian Americans are not white. ItтАЩs true that certain socioeconomic and demographic measures, such as aggregate income and education levels, suggest that on average Asian Americans are among the most successful in the United States. However, many Asian American ethnic groups represent populations experiencing stark economic inequalities. These limited economic metrics are not the only measures of racial marginalization. Asian Americans continue to experience discrimination, hate crimes and racial violence, xenophobia, concerning levels of racial/ethnic bullying in schools, and other indicators of racial marginalization in the U.S. Look too quickly, and you might think that Asian Americans are not directly affected by racism. However, Asian Americans report experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination at about the same frequency as African Americans. Even though anti-Asian racism is not the same as anti-Black racism, both types of racism still reinforce and result from structures of white dominance. Systemic white supremacy affects different populations in different ways. This question can be answered in at least two ways. First, the term тАЬAsian AmericanтАЭ encompasses a rapidly growing racial demographic that includes a vast array of ethnic groups with diverse histories of immigration and refugee resettlement in the U.S. This range of socioeconomic realities, and ideological differences make it challenging to characterize the population in any one way, as documented by AAPI Data. Second, and more importantly, the Asian American identity represents a panethnic political identity. The formation of the term тАЬAsian AmericanтАЭ during the 1960s civil rights movement era was not only an act of resistance against orientalism, it also reflected a self-determined commitment to engage in coalitional work and a means to establish anti-racist political power. Both answers respond to intersectional anti-Asian racism including bans on immigration and citizenship for people from all or parts of Asia between 1882 and 1965 in the U.S., exclusion, segregation, and barriers to education, among other examples of violence and racial marginalization. They affirm that identifying as Asian American is not a biological destiny or question of geography, which would suggest a passive orientation (i.e. individuals are born Asian) rather than an active choice to identify in solidarity against matrices of oppressionтАФinternal and externalтАФto the Asian American community. For those drawn to the term as a political tool for organizing, solidarity is key and requires individuals to reflect on and claim тАЬAsian AmericanтАЭ as opposed to being defaulted into the racial category. Like Asian American identity, People of Color (POC) and Womxn of Color (WOC) identities can gloss over the distinct ways in which Indigenous and various communities of color experience U.S. colonialism and racism. Moreover, racial dynamics pitting Asian Americans against other racially marginalized people can stymie the development of political solidarity required in the cultivation of POC and WOC identities. Asian Americans do not arrive at political identities such as POC or WOC in a singular way, and some reject these terms altogether. NaseebтАЩs journey into WOC identity prompted her to reflect on Asian American identity politics and the limitations of the termтАФAsian AmericanтАФto address colorism or experiences beyond East Asians, leaving her, a Desi, to initially find comfort in WOC identity. OiYan has primarily identified as Asian American, finding the term to be more politically empowering than identifying as тАЬChinese American.тАЭ Her father, an immigrant from Hong Kong who often discusses his own experiences with anti-Asian racism, only recently began expressing racial solidarity with African Americans and their struggles against state violence in the U.S., because the police violence against liberation activists in Hong Kong has resembled contemporary scenes of anti-Black police violence. Answering whether Asian Americans identify with other solidarity terms is not simple and often reveals individual identity development, sociocultural politics, and availability of critical education. There has been an equally complex history of intergroup relations involving other minoritized communities. Political forces have drastically shifted racial stereotypes of Asian Americans from a threat to whiteness to a model minority, often presented as a counterpoint to civil rights movements and advocacy led by African Americans. Commonly mistaken as a тАЬpositiveтАЭ stereotype, the model minority myth upholds systemic white supremacy by dismissing historical and contemporary realities of both anti-Asian racism and racism against other POC. Under such white U.S. settler colonial logics, humanness is maintained by treating Black people as socially dead. For example, in 2019, Chinese American immigrants in Seattle mobilized and worked with white supremacists against affirmative action, revealing unsettling ways in which Asian Americans secure their own humanness by strengthening white dominance. As OiYan has discussed, anti-affirmative action activism among some Asian Americans represents efforts to climb the U.S. racial hierarchy and obtain the privileges of whiteness. In contrast, other Asian Americans have chosen to work in solidarity with other communities of color for a racial justice agenda. See, for example, the activist legacies of the late Yuri Kochiyama, Grace Lee Boggs, and Larry Itliong. In recent years, Japanese Americans have created Vigilant Love, which is a solidarity community movement against Islamophobia, Hmong American refugees have organized support for Syrian refugees, and Vietnamese American women have launched the #ImReady Movement, which offers a platform for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women and girls to тАЬchallenge and end violence within and against AAPI communities.тАЭ These examples reflect the existence of intergroup solidarity amid exclusionary politics. Social influencers, such as Trans* activist ALOK, Filipinx comic creator Trinidad Escobar, and the first late-night bisexual Punjabi female host Lilly Singh reflect the continued rise of unapologetic Asian narratives that simultaneously challenge audiences to consider the complex experiences and humanity of racially minoritized, LGBTQIA+, immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous communities. Asian American, POC, and WOC identities and coalitions cannot exist without the development of civic practices for solidarity. All three of these terms are tools for enacting political agenda for intersectional racial justice. For example, in Chicago, the HANA CenterтАФa Korean American community organization in a multiethnic neighborhoodтАФhas facilitated dialogues for Korean immigrant elders that compare images of anti-Black violence and grassroots movements in Ferguson with the 1980 Gwangju uprising and massacre, to cultivate cross-racial community understanding and collaboration. This example reveals that a shared identity, whether Asian American, POC, or WOC, does not mean individuals have the same experiences. Second, it shows the power of leveraging specific contexts in supporting critical acknowledgement of power differences across groups. It also suggests that activists can and should seek lessons in global histories and movements for liberation to collectively confront white U.S. settler colonial contexts both within and outside of the Asian American diaspora. For some of youтАФAsian American or otherwiseтАФthis article may be the first time youтАЩre reading about, and considering, the complexities of Asian Americans as racialized subjects. From what weтАЩve personally witnessed, this is a common experience. A key way white supremacy sustains itself is through narrative scarcity, which keeps us ignorant about our many stories that can tell us more about complex racial dynamics and systemic racism. Unveiling buried histories and examples of intergroup solidarity and coalition building can lead to collective analyses required in movements for a more just future.

98,Asian Americans In Hollywood,"NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks with YouTube personality Philip Wang about how far Asian media representation has come in the U.S. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: OK, it's been a big year for Asian and Asian American representation in Hollywood. The Korean thriller ""Parasite"" is up for six Oscar nominations, including best picture. Actor Awkwafina made history by winning a Golden Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy. She's the first woman of Asian descent to win that award. Philip Wang is a co-founder of Wong Fu Productions. And he's been navigating the media landscape long before Hollywood was making movies like ""Crazy Rich Asians"" or ""The Farewell."" He makes sketch videos and short films for a following of over 3.2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel. And he is happy about the rise of Asian representation in the mainstream media, of course. But he says there's still a lot of room for growth. PHILIP WANG: I think, you know, it's one of those things where we are still seeing evidence that we are othered in this system and that there is still a lot more room for improvement. But, you know, I definitely would not discount the strides we've made as a community and as artists and filmmakers. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Give me an example of being othered. I mean, what are you seeing? WANG: Yeah. No, I mean, it's funny. Like when growing up here in the States, you know, that - because we're relatively new to this country, there isn't a lot of established Asian American culture for us to kind of gravitate towards. So I think a lot of people - just based on our - you know, how we look - think, oh, they must be from overseas. They must be foreign. And so a lot of Asian Americans, you know, were forced to assimilate in some type of way to try to fit in. And yeah, like a lot of times, you know, that meant, you know, silencing our own stories just to make sure that we weren't viewed as these foreigners. And now we're just kind of coming around to believing that what we've been through, what our parents have been through does have a place in the American narrative. And I think for the first time, thanks to social media, we're kind of finally coming into truly being accepted in American society. And I think that's really great. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, I want to talk a little bit about social media. Before Hollywood was receptive to Asian American movies, YouTube was a major outlet for Asian American filmmakers. Awkwafina got her start on YouTube. How has Asian filmmaking sort of evolved over the years to reach the mainstream? And how important was a platform like YouTube? WANG: Oh, man. I think digital platforms in general were immensely effective and useful for our community, I think, because - YouTube first came on 2005. So anything before then, if you wanted to pursue entertainment or any kind of storytelling or creator career, you had to go the traditional Hollywood route. And there's already so many obstacles for Asian Americans. YouTube was a very useful tool at the time for us to kind of like circumvent the system because the technology allowed us to create things on our own, put it out there for however many people to see and generate our own audiences. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why do you think (unintelligible) this moment for Asian Americans? Other groups, particularly Latinos, are still sort of dealing with abysmal representation in Hollywood. You know, not to pit one group against the other, but are they seen differently? WANG: Yeah. I mean, that's a really, really complex question. As marginalized communities, we just want to be seen in a way that perhaps mainstream doesn't normally see us, right? So we're always trying to battle that stereotype, right? It's kind of funny like, you know, a lot of Asians like, yeah, we want to be the jocks. And we want to be the tough guys or the gangsters. And you look at the African American community, they're like, no, we don't - we have too much of that. We want to be seen as the nerds. And we want to be seen as the educators and the doctors so... GARCIA-NAVARRO: I know. The Latinos are like, yeah, we want to be crazy rich Latinos, you know? (LAUGHTER) WANG: So at the end of the day, it just proves that what we really need to do in each of our respective communities is try to build systems where we can have that control of what we want to see. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I have one final question for you. WANG: Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Awkwafina robbed at the Oscars, yes or no? WANG: I would say it's - here's the thing. Like, I already believe that that system is already stacked against us anyways. But at the end of the day, like, I don't want to focus so much on the negative side of it. I would rather like, you know, say, hey, you know what? Awkwafina literally is having the most amazing few years right now. And it's going to inspire many more creators to continue pushing the movement forward and being proof to the business that we can have stories like this out there that are more nuanced about Asian, Asian Americans. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hear, hear. Youtube creator Philip Wang is co-founder of Wong Fu Productions. Thank you very much. WANG: Thank you. I appreciate it.

171,AACE INTERVIEW: Richard Huang of CLOUDIOUS9 ├втВмтАЭ Asian Americans for Cannabis Education,"Xin Nian kuai Le! Happy Chinese New Year of the Prosperous and Very Smart Rat!! Today we have the very smart Richard Huang featured here on AACE. We are honored to have Richard here and we are honored to share with you his inspirational words. The term ma, used to describe cannabis by 2700 BCE, is the oldest recorded name for the plant, and trailblazers like Richard are continuing the innovation in both better health and technology. How had your views on cannabis changed? And what was the impetus to that change? I was born in Taiwan and came to the United States when I was 10. When I was brought up in Taiwan, we were taught anything classified as тАЬdrugsтАЭ would ruin your life within a single-use, while other more socially acceptable substances like alcohol or cigarettes were perfectly fine for adults. Cannabis was certainly considered тАЬdrugsтАЭ. When a substance falls under the drug category, it was not further subcategorized and there was no explanation on how it interacts with your body. Perhaps by design, we simply did not understand it and was simply told to stay away from it. As a teenager growing up in the United States, I was of course exposed to cannabis at the same time I developed a habit of smoking normal cigarettes. Nicotine addiction became something I continued to struggle with for the rest of my life. I have since stopped smoking, but after experiencing firsthand the negative impact it had on my body and how difficult it was to quit made me realize how unfairly cannabis has been treated in our society and especially in the Asian culture. There are so many substances that do astronomically more harm than cannabis, yet it is considered legal and even safer. My personal experience made me understand I was misled for a good part of my life, and sometimes you really cannot believe what you are told. I strongly believe in and would advocate for more extensive research surrounding cannabis and hope one day we can truly understand this herb to its entirety. I hope we can understand the good it can bring, and not shy away from understanding any potential harm. Treat it fairly and help educate others to do the same. How did you enter the cannabis industry? After starting my career as a Certified Public Accountant, I decided I craved the challenges of entrepreneurship and started my first business a little over 10 years ago. Over the last decade, I built an international e-commerce business across Asia and the USA bringing various products (non-cannabis) to market. I saw an opportunity several years ago due to the limited innovation on the hardware side that was occurring to transfer my skill sets and experience to the cannabis industry. Did you do research into cannabis before entering? I researched what companies were innovating in the space, and how best I could leverage my experience to add value to the industry. I realized that large established consumer electronics companies weren't entering the space, so there was a unique opportunity to use my product development skill sets and create a company based on innovation. That led to the development of our first product, the Hydrology9, which was one of the first water filtered vaporizers on the market. How does your family feel about your cannabis businesses?I was fortunate to have a very open-minded and extremely supportive immediate family. However, I cannot say the same with all my family. To eliminate any unnecessary confrontations or discussion, there are certainly some distant family members who I rather not go down that rabbit hole with. What is the most frequent question you are asked about cannabis? The most frequent question I get asked, is how do I see technology changing the cannabis space? One of the biggest trends I have seen is that the consumption method is chosen by the consumer radically changes the perception of the cannabis brand being consumed. As a result, brands are investing in technology in an effort to streamline and produce consistent brand experiences for the consumer. What is your favorite way of ingesting cannabis? It would have to be dry herb vaporization and more recently concentrates. I enjoy the variety of choices as to how clean it is on your body. One of our core missions is to always be looking at ways to provide a new and better consumer experience and we believe hardware serves a unique role in the space to bring about such an innovative experience. Where do you see the cannabis industry in five years? Continuing to grow and becoming an economic cornerstone of the economy, much like the alcohol industry is today, but on a longer timeline then five years. We also believe the social stigma around the cannabis industry will continue to dissipate and significant headways will be made in turning the industry more mainstream. Why do you think some Asians are against cannabis? The most obvious reason is that culturally and philosophically, Asian culture emphasis a lot of self-control and has generally some reservation towards anything that is considered pleasurable. To a degree, we think anything pleasurable makes you lose control.As a fan of history, I personally believe there is also a historical reason as well. The opium war that occurred during the mid-19th century was a short two-year war where China lost concession of Hong Kong and it was very significant as it reflected the undeniable truth that China was far behind the industrialized world. I feel the Chinese society went through a long period of self-reflection on how it lost its position in the world as a first world country and opium addiction was to a large degree used as a scapegoat as one of the reasons why China fell so far behind. I believe this has a lot to do with why most Chinese culture-based countries in the world are extremely hard on any kind of recreational substance. Cannabis was unfortunately lumped together with the rest of тАЬdrugsтАЭ.┬а ┬а I strongly believe in and would advocate for more extensive research surrounding cannabis and hope one day we can truly understand this herb to its entirety. The Cloudious9 line of futuristic design of vaporizers. The newest technology is the Hydrology9 using he results are a brand-new approach to liquid filtration, and the birth of our patent-pending ""tunnel tube"" liquid filtration design. ┬й 2015 Asian Americans for Cannabis Education | #AACEit powered by Asian Americans for Cannabis Education",0,0,0,0
208,"Interview: Jessica Kim, Author of ├втВм╦ЬStand Up, Yumi Chung!├втВмтДв, Tells Us About Her Journey As An Asian American Woman","a fresh take on asian music and culture┬а ┬а If you donтАЩt know Yumi Chung, youтАЩre about to! Stand Up, Yumi Chung! is the debut novel from author Jessica Kim. Yumi aspires to be a stand-up comedian, but straddles the traditions of her familyтАЩs culture and the untamed world around her. Kim writes about Asian American girls finding their way in the world. K-Ci Williams spoke with Kim about her journey as an Asian American woman and how it lead to YumiтАЩs story. Meet Yumi Chung: the star of the novel and your typical middle school kid. тАЬSheтАЩs kind of shy, a bit awkward, funnier in her head than in real life, struggles to make friends and yearns to be a better version of herself,тАЭ Kim says. SheтАЩs also an avid comedian. тАЬPart of the draw is it allows her to slip into another persona, someone who is confident and comfortable in her own skin. It allows her to access the parts of herself that rarely make it out of her own head.тАЭ Do both author and protagonist share this attraction? тАЬI do enjoy comedy, but IтАЩm not as hardcore of a fan as Yumi is. I prefer to just watch it rather than perform it.тАЭ What they do share is their тАШwantтАЩ to pursue their passion but holding off out of fear. Asked to summarise the novel in five words, Kim says: тАЬYumi longs to be heard.тАЭ Kim never thought she would be an author. It wasnтАЩt something somebody like her would accomplish. тАЬNo one in my community had ever written a book,тАЭ she says. тАЬIn my mind that was what white people did. It wasnтАЩt until I was thirty-five years old and my kids had started school that it crossed my mind.тАЭ Things were changing in KimтАЩs family; the children were growing more self-sufficient, she wanted to return to work, but also wrote a list of things she had always wanted to do. Lists are a hallmark of an author. And the first thing on the list? Write a book for kids. тАЬIt was super scary and I wasnтАЩt sure if I had what it took, but I knew that IтАЩd always regret it if I didnтАЩt try. I took a few classes and joined a critique group which helped me plug into the writing community which was key. A year and a half later, I wrote a YA that I queried but it never got picked up by an agent. Sick of rejection, I quit writing. But I didnтАЩt last too long because I missed writing.тАЭ Kim kept re-imagining her story as a middle grade novel, and thus Stand Up, Yumi Chung! was born. Kim used to work as a teacher long before having intentions to publish a novel. тАЬYou could say that I have been groomed to be a middle grade writer for a while,тАЭ she says. тАЬHaving spent ten years with tweens in the classroom, IтАЩve become familiar with the issues that young people face during that age. ItтАЩs a challenging time of lots of changes: puberty, middle school friend drama, parents on your back etc. But itтАЩs also an intense time of self-discovery and imagination. Kids at this age are so passionate and eager to jump into the things theyтАЩre into. Yet theyтАЩre still tender and need lots of love and forgiveness. It was the perfect age group to explore some of the themes that I wanted to write about.тАЭ YumiтАЩs story feels like a culmination of KimтАЩs experiences; all her love and light channeled into a novel. тАЬThis book contains many dimensions of me,тАЭ she says. тАЬYumi kept her comedy a secret from her friends and family. When I first started writing, I too didnтАЩt really tell people much about what I was up to, out of fear of failure.тАЭ It stands to reason that the intersection of being a person of colour and a woman is an added layer to her experience in writing the novel. тАЬMany of the emotions in this book were very real reflections of how I was feeling about my own identity as a creative person in Asian America.тАЭ For Kim, her Korean culture as a child of immigrants has informed her journey in every way. тАЬMy culture is a mix of my upbringing by Korean parents and what I picked up from growing up in America. In a sense, this book is a journey of Yumi coming to accept her parentsтАЩ culture and herself. Learning to love both parts of her identity.тАЭ Speaking on the inspiration for YumiтАЩs story, Kim explains that sheтАЩs often asked if she wrote the book for her daughters. She did not. тАЬMy kids have two American-born, English speaking parents who were educated in America. They donтАЩt know what itтАЩs like to walk the right rope of being a second generation American, having to toggle between two cultures, sometimes two cultures that are at odds. They never had to translate for their parents or help out at their small business to make ends meet.тАЭ ItтАЩs personal to Kim but also an inherently shared experience for people who grew up like her. тАЬThis book is for me,тАЭ she says. тАЬThe child me. And all the other kids who are like me. Kids who struggle to piece together both sides of their identity. I think thatтАЩs a really important message. That you are enough, just as you are.тАЭ Kim is a self-professed ARMY тАФ which means sheтАЩll also be fighting us for BTS tour tickets in a couple of weeks. тАШMikrokosmosтАЩ, тАШSpring DayтАЩ, тАШLove MazeтАЩ, and тАШIdolтАЩ are her favourite songs, and she is Namjoon-biased. Yumi on the other hand? тАЬYumi is totally ARMY,тАЭ she says. Her bias is Jungkook, and her friend Ginny is J-Hope biased. тАЬBTS is mentioned five times in the book,тАЭ (hint: the first mention is on page 2). Authors can become published at any time of their lives; some of the most rich and layered works are from authors published later in life. Kim offers wisdom to these writers: тАЬYou arenтАЩt old. You just have more story in you. All those things youтАЩve seen and experienced give you more to draw on. ItтАЩs a good thing. ItтАЩs not a race.тАЭ Kim also speaks to those who arenтАЩt accustomed to seeing themselves reflected in the media. тАЬMaybe you can create something and put it out into the world. We need you.тАЭ Speaking to the child in herself and the persona of Yumi, Kim has a lifetime of knowledge to impart. тАЬYooms, itтАЩs okay if you mess up. ItтАЩs part of the process. How can you know what works unless you know what doesnтАЩt work? Also, you are special and loved and seen just as you are. You do not need to be anyone, except who you already are.тАЭ Stand Up, Yumi Chung! is released officially on March 17, 2020.

548,"Bullies attack Asian American teen at school, accusing him of having coronavirus","Watch CBSN Live By Christina Capatides February 14, 2020 / 1:53 PM / CBS News A 16-year-old boy in California's San Fernando Valley was physically attacked this week by bullies in his high school who accused him of having the coronavirus тАФ simply because he is Asian American. It is just the latest episode in a spree of racist incidents linked to the global health emergency over the novel coronavirus, now named COVID-19. ""He went to the hospital originally, and went to the emergency room,"" Robin Toma, the executive director of the L.A. County Human Relations Commission, said in a joint news conference with Los Angeles County public officials on Thursday. ""They were taking MRIs to ensure he didn't have a concussion or other harm."" According to CBS Los Angeles, officials released neither the name of the student's school nor any further details of the attack, noting only that Los Angeles police are now investigating. ""Our goal is to send out accurate information to all of our 80 districts, reaching over 2 million children,"" said Debra Duardo, L.A. County Superintendent of Schools. ""To tell them that there is no need for excessive fear, that there is very minimal risk of contracting the coronavirus, and that we will not tolerate any type of bullying."" There have been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. to date, including eight cases in California. Those patients are being treated in medical isolation, and officials stressed the virus is not currently spreading in the community. And while the outbreak originated in China, it has nothing to do with being Asian. ""Anyone that discriminates in that manner and puts out false information should be investigated,"" L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis said in Thursday's news conference. ""And I understand the FBI is launching an investigation."" There have been other incidents around the country where Asian Americans have reported being targeted over unfounded fears of coronavirus. In Austin, Texas, last week, Amy Wong Mok, the president of the Asian American Cultural Center, told CBS Austin that when one of her staff members coughed at a local fitness center, other patrons left. ""She just coughed a little bit because she was coming in from the cold air and then people left,"" Mok said. ""Just a small cough and the people just left, left her like the plague."" She added, ""At least they left. They didn't attack her."" In a similar incident, a Vietnamese-American eighth grader in Los Angeles named Dylan Muriano was sent to the nurse's office at his middle school on Wednesday because he coughed from swallowing water. ""He actually said to me, 'all the other students who are coughing, they don't get sent out.' But they're not Asian,"" the boy's mother, longtime L.A. news anchor Leyna Nguyen, told Fox 11. To make matters worse, when the nurse cleared Muriano to return to his classroom, the eighth grader alleges that his peers teased him about having coronavirus. This sort of outbreak-fueled anti-Asian racism also occurred in 2003 during the SARS virus scare. But public officials caution that it is neither based in fact, nor acceptable behavior. ""Many may be quick to assume that just because someone is Asian or from China that somehow they are more likely to be carriers of the virus,"" said Robin Toma of the L.A. County Human Relations Commission. ""We need to speak out against this when we see it. We need to speak up, not be bystanders, be upstanders."" And as the L.A. County schools superintendent noted, the change in behavior needed likely starts with parents. ""Hate is something children learn,"" Debra Duardo said, as she stood with members of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. ""It doesn't come naturally to them.""

By Cathy Park Hong Posted on February 24, 2020, at 11:23 a.m. ET Excerpted from Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning by Cathy Park Hong. Copyright ┬й2020. Available from Penguin Random House. I had a special, almost erotic, relationship with my stationery when I was young. I collected stationery items the way other kids collect dolls or action figures. тАЬReally I must buy a pencil,тАЭ Virginia Woolf said, without warning, before rushing out the door to begin her peregrination throughout the wintry streets of London. I would have related to her urgency. I too felt passionately for the lead pencil, as long as it was a thin lavender mechanical pencil with a Hello Kitty bauble clasped to the tip with a delicate silver chain. And erasers too, scented raspberry or vanilla, molded into plump pastel wall-eyed Sanrio critters. I adored my erasers so much I had to repress the urge to bite their heads off. I was careful at first, gently brushing the bobbed feet against my notebook. But once my eraser was spoiled with graphite, I ruthlessly rubbed away my errors until all that remained was a gray dusty nub of face with one sad punctuation of an eye. For some reason, I was a target in church camp, where the Korean girls my age ostracized me out of their room, claiming all the beds, saying they were taken even if they were not, so I was forced to bunk with the younger girls in the next room. One early morning, I was betrayed by my beloved stationery. I opened up my Hello Kitty diary, which IтАЩd left unlocked, and saw that someone had inscribed, on the first page, in neat cursive that must have been written with a mechanical pencil: Ketty, go home. The Korean girls I knew were so moody they made Sylvia Plath seem as dull as C-SPAN. Some were from L.A.тАЩs Koreatown, wore fake Juicy Couture, applied makeup like Chollas, and spoke in the regional creole accent of FOB, Gangsta, and Valley. тАЬBitch, what are you looking at? Are you a lesbo?тАЭ asked one girl named Grace when she caught me gawking at her white ghost lips outlined in black lip pencil. Later, I tried to look up lesbo in the dictionary and was relieved that I couldnтАЩt find it. Because I grew up around bad English, I was bad at English. I was born in L.A. but wasnтАЩt fluent until the embarrassingly delayed age of six, maybe even seven. Matriculating at school was like moving to another country. Up until then, I was surrounded by Korean. The English heard in church, among friends and family in K-town, was short, barbed, and broken: subject and object nouns conjoined in odd marriages, verbs forever disagreeing, definite articles nowhere to be found. Teenagers vented by interjecting Korean with the ever-present fuck: тАЬFuck him! OpaтАЩs an asshole.тАЭ The immigrantтАЩs first real introduction to surviving in English is profanity. When my cousins came over to the United States, I immediately passed on a cache of curses to them to prepare for school. My uncle said he used to start and end all his sentences with тАЬmotherfuckerтАЭ because he learned his English from his black customers when he was a clothing wholesaler in New York. My uncle, a profane and boisterous man, has since returned to Seoul and keeps up his English with me. Uncle: What is the word? The word when you have lice down there. Niece: Crabs? Uncle: Yes! Crabs. I have learned a new English wordтАФ crabs! It is what I had once. Niece: . . . Uncle: It is not what you are thinking. I did not get it from a whore. Niece: HowтАЩd you get it? Uncle: Military service. It was so easy to get the crab. There were no bathrooms, only hole in the ground. We had to shave so we had no hair down there. A terrible time. Once we tied a man to a tree and left him there. English was always borrowed, from hip-hop to Spanglish to The Simpsons. Early on, my father learned that in America, one must be emotionally demonstrative to succeed, so he has a habit of saying тАЬI love youтАЭ indiscriminately, to his daughters, to his employees, to his customers, and to airline personnel. He must have observed a salesman affectionately slap another salesman on the back while saying, тАЬLove ya, man, good to see you!тАЭ But because there is no fraternizing man or slap on the back, his usage has an indelicate intimacy, especially since he quietly unloads the endearment as a burning confession: тАЬThanks for getting those orders in,тАЭ heтАЩll say before hanging up the phone. тАЬOh, and Kirby, I love you.тАЭ I did not actually use my mechanical pencils so much as line them up to admire them. My mechanical pencils, in pistachio, plum, and cotton candy pink, were wands of sublime femininity that had to be saved for later. The longer I saved them, the more unbearable became my need to use them. But still I denied myself, because the exquisite pleasure was the mounting longing for them rather than the gratification of that longing. One has an overwhelming desire to eat what is cute, writes Sianne Ngai, and therefore cuteness is ideal for mass commodification because of its consumability. Cute objects are feminine, defenseless, and diminutive things, provoking our maternal desires to hold and nuzzle them as I had with my mouthless Sanrio erasers. But they can also unlock our sadistic desires to master and violate them, which is why I probably held off using my stationery in order to ward off my darker instincts. Eventually, I gave in. I clicked the tip of my mechanical pencil, which snipped out a nib of lead. Because I had no interest in writing when I was young, I drew. I drew girls that looked nothing like me. I was at first a poor draftsman, outlining the U for the face, then filling in eyes that were lopsided dewdrops, then roofing the face with hair curls as coarse as bedsprings. But over the years, my technique became refined, and I could decently draw the anime girls I adored. I took pleasure in drawing the eyes because I, like everyone else, fetishized anime eyes, those bewitching orbs en-gorged with irises of snow-flecked sapphire and thatched over with the inkiest lashes. How huge and innocent those anime eyes, how meager my own slits. But the nose eluded me. I could not get that snubbed peck of a nose right, no matter how much I practiced drawing it. I had the misfortune of inheriting my fatherтАЩs pronounced nose that in pro- file looked like a 6. When I complained about it, my mother protested it was a royal nose, but the kids in church called out the truth in their basic English. тАЬWhy do you have such a big nose?тАЭ тАЬBig nose.тАЭ I drew peck after peck on sheets of paper, wasting reams so I could pin down that perfect nose. Once I dreamed of anime girls soaring up and down on pogo sticks, their pigtails a nimbus of curls, their tartan skirts aswirl, their enormous eyes cracked with light. I looked up in time to see a girl arc up in the air and then rocket straight down for meтАФto pogo my nose down to a button. I am now in the habit of collecting bad English. I browse Engrish.com, a gag site that uploads photographs of mis translated English from East Asian countries. The images are separated into signs (тАЬPlease No Conversation, No SalivaтАЭ), T-shirts (тАЬI feel a happiness when I eat HimтАЭ), and menus (тАЬroasted husbandтАЭ). The most viewed image is a cartoon ad of a popular sweet tapioca pearl beverage with the caption тАЬIтАЩm Bubble Tea! Suck my Balls!тАЭ I steal these lines and use them in my poetry. Take the phrase тАЬI feel a happiness when I eat him.тАЭ It has all the traits of a surprising poetic line. A familiar sentiment is now unfamiliar because chance has turned Error into Eros. That needless тАЬaтАЭ is crucial since it tweaks the tone into a slightly sinister animatronic pitch while indicating that the lover is not awash in happiness but feels happiness at a remove. Like an extra tooth, that тАЬaтАЭ forces open a bead of uncertainty, or cold reflection, while she takes into consideration her happiness. She is not sure why she is happy, but she is, as she eats him. One day, I was browsing through the T-shirt category. I happened upon an image of a young Chinese boy innocently wearing a shirt branded with the word тАЬPoontang.тАЭ This photo triggered my own memory of the time I arrived in elementary school wearing a Playboy Bunny T-shirt. I had completely forgotten about it. Thinking of that memory, I was made sharply aware of the people who were taking these photos: backpackers traveling through Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and ChinaтАФwhite and Asian American tourists. Outsiders who were at home treating the natives like they were the outsiders. English is our ever-expanding neoliberal lingua franca, the consumer language of brand recognition and outsourced labor. The more developing the nation, the more in need that nation is of a copy editor. When I lived in Seoul for a year in 2005, I too snapped photographs of the Engrishisms that plastered storefronts like bad wallpaper. But I was also disturbed by how much globalization has led to English cannibalizing Korean. Reading a sign in Hangul characters, I slowly sounded out an unfamiliar word, only to realize that the word was lipo-suk-shen. A friend told me that teenage couples preferred saying тАЬI love youтАЭ in English rather than the Korean equivalent because they thought it was a truer expression of their love. Apparently, Asian children innocently wearing profanity- laden T-shirts were at some point an Internet meme. I found images of a young girl wearing a sweater of Mickey Mouse giving the finger; a kindergartner wearing a sleeveless тАЬWish you were BeerтАЭ; a forlorn boy sitting on the bleachers in a тАЬWho the Fuck is JesusтАЭ sweater. I thought, I have found my people. Once a source of shame, but I now say it proudly: bad English is my heritage. I share a literary lineage with writers who make the unmastering of English their rallying cryтАФwho queer it, twerk it, hack it, Calibanize it, other it by hijacking English and warping it to a fugitive tongue. To other English is to make audible the imperial power sewn into the language, to slit English open so its dark histories slide out. My motherтАЩs English has remained rudimentary during her forty-plus years living in the United States. When she speaks Korean, my mother speaks her mind. She is sharp, witty, and judgmental, if rather self-preening. But her English is a crush of piano keys that used to make me cringe whenever she spoke to a white person. As my mother spoke, I watched the white person, oftentimes a woman, put on a fright mask of strained tolerance: wide eyes frozen in trapped patience, smile widened in condescension. As she began responding to my mother in a voice reserved for toddlers, I stepped in. From a young age, I learned to speak for my mother as authoritatively as I could. Not only did I want to dispel the derision I saw behind that womanтАЩs eyes, I wanted to shame her with my sobering fluency for thinking what she was thinking. I have been partly drawn to writing, I realize, to judge those who have unfairly judged my family; to prove that IтАЩve been watching this whole time. Pity the Asian accent. It is such a degraded accent, one of the last accents acceptable to mock. How hard it is to speak through it to make yourself heard. I am embarrassed to say that I sometimes act like that white woman. When I phone in my order to a Chinese restaurant and the cashier doesnтАЩt understand me, I repeat myself impatiently. When I call Time Warner and reach a representative with an Indian accent, I am already exasperated because I heard that Indian call centers barely train their employees. I have a theory that Seamless was invented so Americans donтАЩt have to hassle with immigrant accents. Automation will replace Indian call centers for this very reason. Machines will flatten the accents of nationalities already flattened by English. I have noticed that a new TV Asian accent has emerged, an accent used by no Asian except for Asian American actors onscreen: this accent is gentle, sitcom-friendly, easy listening. I have a hard time with the rare Asian American sitcom on offer, since they are so pandering and full of cute banter. But then, IтАЩm of the extreme opinion that a real show about a Korean familyтАФat least the kind I grew up aroundтАФis un- televisable. Americans would be both bored and appalled. My God, why canтАЩt someone call Child Protective Services! theyтАЩd shout at the screen. My grandmother used to watch the old dating show Love Connection religiously. She didnтАЩt understand English at all, but she still found it uproariously funny to watch two people talk at each other on the couch. Laughing along to the laugh track, sheтАЩd turn to me to see if I was laughing, then turn back to the TV to laugh some more. That canned soundtrack, echoed by my grandmother, was a hollow cave of sound that sharpened the cheerless tension in our household. While she watched, I sat, vigilant and ears pricked, increasingly agitated by the laugh trackтАЩs annoying demand that I join in. My home was a provisional space in which the present was always wasted in dreaded anticipation of the future. I always knew when my mother was in one of her moods, though I never exactly knew when sheтАЩd strike, so I waited and waited until I heard her shriek my name at the top of her lungs, which was my cue to leap up and slam all the windows shut so our inside sounds wouldnтАЩt leak outside. As a poet, I have always treated English as a weapon in a power struggle, wielding it against those who are more powerful than me. But I falter when using English as an expression of love. IтАЩve always been so protective of making sure that my familyтАЩs inside sounds didnтАЩt leak outside that I donтАЩt know how to allow the outside in. I was raised by a kind of love that was so inextricable from pain that I fear that once I air that love, it will oxidize to betrayal, as if IтАЩm turning English against my family. How far can I travel harvesting bad English before IтАЩm called a trespasser? While I have borrowed from Hawaiian Pidgin and Spanglish in the past, I would think twice before using these languages now. When the film Crazy Rich Asians premiered, the twittersphere called out as тАЬblackfaceтАЭ the actor AwkwafinaтАЩs accent, an accent not far removed from the K-town one I heard growing up in L.A. It never occurred to me that those K-town girls were doing blackface. I thought they were just talking the way other teens around them talked. At the time of my writing, this country has seen a retrenchment of identities on both sides of the political spectrum. The rise of white nationalism has led to many nonwhites defending their identities with rage and pride as well as demanding reparative action to compensate for centuries of whites plundering from non-Western cultures. But a side effect of this justified rage has been a тАЬstay in your laneтАЭ politics in which artists and writers are asked to speak only from their personal ethnic experiences. Such a politics not only assumes racial identity is pureтАФwhile ignoring the messy lived realities in which racial groups overlapтАФbut reduces racial identity to intellectual property. When we are inspired by a poem or novel, our human impulse is to share it so that, as Lewis Hyde writes, it leaves a trail of тАЬinterconnected relationships in its wake.тАЭ But in the market economy, art is a commodity removed from circulation and kept. If the work of art circulates, it circulates for profit, which has been grossly reaped by white author- ship. Speaking on this subject, Amiri Baraka offers an in-valuable quote: тАЬAll cultures learn from each other. The problem is that if the Beatles tell me that they learned everything they know from Blind Willie, I want to know why Blind Willie is still running an elevator in Jackson, Mississippi.тАЭ We must make right this unequal distribution but we must do so without forgetting the immeasurable value of cultural exchange in what Hyde calls the gift economy. In reacting against the market economy, we have internalized market logic where culture is hoarded as if itтАЩs a product that will depreciate in value if shared with others; where instead of decolonizing English, we are carving up English into hostile nation-states. The soul of innovation thrives on cross- cultural inspiration. If we are restricted to our lanes, culture will die. Rather than тАЬspeaking aboutтАЭ a culture outside your experience, the filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha suggests we тАЬspeak nearby.тАЭ When you decide to speak nearby, rather than speak about, the first thing you need to do is to acknowledge the possible gap between you and those who populate your film: in other words, to leave the space of representation open so that, although youтАЩre very close to your subject, youтАЩre also committed to not speaking on their behalf, in their place or on top of them. You can only speak nearby, in proximity (whether the other is physically present or absent), which requires that you deliberately suspend meaning, preventing it from merely closing and hence leaving a gap in the formation process. This allows the other person to come in and fill that space as they wish. Such an approach gives freedom to both sides and this may account for it being taken up by filmmakers who recognize in it a strong ethical stance. By not trying to assume a position of authority in relation to the other, you are actually freeing yourself from the endless criteria generated with such an all-knowing claim and its hierarchies in knowledge. I turned to the modular essay because I am only capable of тАЬspeaking nearbyтАЭ the Asian American condition, which is so involuted that I canтАЩt stretch myself across it. The more I try to pin it, the more it escapes my grasp. I tried to write about it as a lyric poem, but the lyric, to me, is a stage, a pedestal from which I throw my voice to point out what IтАЩm not (the curse of anyone nonwhite is that you are so busy arguing what youтАЩre not that you never arrive at what you are). I admit that I sometimes still find the subject, Asian America, to be so shamefully tepid that I am eager to change itтАФ which is why I have chosen this episodic form, with its exit routes that permit me to stray. But I always return, from a different angle, which is my own way of inching closer to it. If IтАЩm going to write nearby my Asian American condition, however, I feel compelled to write nearby other racial experiences. Students have asked me, тАЬHow do I write about racial identity without always reacting to whiteness?тАЭ The automatic answer is тАЬTell your story.тАЭ But this too can be a reaction to whiteness, since white publishers want тАЬthe Mus- lim experienceтАЭ or тАЬthe black experience.тАЭ They want ethnicity to be siloed because itтАЩs easier to understand, easier to brand. Ever since I started writing, I was not just interested in telling my story but also in finding a formтАФa way of speechтАФthat decentered whiteness. I settled on bad English because, as the artist Gregg Bordowitz said about radical art, it bypasses social media algorithms and consumer demographics by bringing together groups who wouldnтАЩt normally be in the same room together. You canтАЩt tweet bad English. If I tweeted a line from my poem, it would sink like a lead balloon. Bad English is best shared offline, in a book or performed live; itтАЩs an interactive diction that must be read aloud to be understood, but even if I donтАЩt quite understand it, those chewy syllables just feel familial to me, no matter the cultural source, which is why it brings together racial groups outside whiteness. But bad English is a dying art because the Internet demands we write clear, succinct poems that stop us mid-scroll. If you want to truly understand someoneтАЩs accented English, you have to slow down and listen with your body. You have to train your ears and offer them your full attention. The Internet doesnтАЩt have time for that. So as long as it lasts, I want to write nearby Rodrigo Toscano, who pulls his Spanglish phonetic syllables apart like taffy (тАЬthaтАЩ vahnahnah go-een to keel jooтАЭ) or LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs, who recombines black slang, Japanese, Spanish, Chamorro, and Tagalog into a remastered Afro- Futurist song (тАЬ. . . bubblegum kink / a SheikтАЩs interloper. / A radical since 1979. / a brujo. A tommy gun. A were- wolf.тАЭ). I canтАЩt speak for the Latinx experience, but I can write about my bad English nearby ToscanoтАЩs bad English while providing gaps between passages for the reader to stitch a thread between us. When I was growing up, black and brown kids were casually racist. Korean kids were casually racist. It didnтАЩt hurt so much when a nonwhite kid called me slant-eyed, because I had a slur to throw back at them. I canтАЩt think of a blameless victim among us. But it would be wrong of me to say that we were all on equal footing, which is why I canтАЩt just write about my bad English next to your bad English. In my efforts to speak nearby, I also have to confront the distance between us, which is challenging because once I implicate myself, I can never implicate myself enough. The distance between us is class. In K-town, Koreans worked the front and Mexicans worked the back. I made a friend whom my mother said I couldnтАЩt play with, and when I asked why, she said it was because she was Mexican. The horror of it was that I told this friend. I said, тАЬI canтАЩt play with you because youтАЩre Mexican,тАЭ and she said, тАЬBut IтАЩm Puerto Rican.тАЭ In his book white flights, the writer Jess Row says that тАЬAmericaтАЩs great and possibly catastrophic failure is its failure to imagine what it means to live together.тАЭ Row contextualizes this insight by reflecting on white postwar novelists who erased their settings of тАЬinconveniently different facesтАЭ so that their white characters could achieve their own тАЬimaginative selfhoodтАЭ without complication. In thinking about my own Asian identity, I donтАЩt think I can seal off my imagined world so itтАЩs only people of my likeness, because it would follow rather than break from this segregated imagination. But having said that, how can I write about us living together when there isnтАЩt too much precedent for it? Can I write about it without resorting to some facile vision of multicultural oneness or the sterilizing language of virtue signaling? Can I write honestly? Not only about how much IтАЩve been hurt but how I have hurt others? And can I do it without steeping myself in guilt, since guilt demands absolution and is therefore self-serving? In other words, can I apologize without demanding your forgiveness? Where do I begin? тЧП Cathy Park Hong is the author of three poetry collections including Dance Dance Revolution, chosen by Adrienne Rich for the Barnard Women Poets Prize, and Engine Empire.

593,Misguided virus fears hitting Asian American businesses,"NEW YORK (AP) тАФ In Arizona, a burgeoning Asian American community fields xenophobic calls about a planned night market featuring Asian street foods. In New York, a dim sum restaurant owner worries he won't make rent. In the San Francisco Bay Area, a local Asian American-owned restaurant chain is mulling temporarily shuttering one of its properties because of the downturn in trade. In major U.S. cities, Asian American businesses are seeing a remarkable decline in customers as fear about the viral outbreak from China spreads. City and health officials are trying to stanch the financial bleeding through information campaigns and personal visits to shops and restaurants, emphasizing that, with just 15 cases diagnosed in the entire country, there is no reason to avoid them. Business owners, some of whom have seen their customer traffic cut by more than half, are anxiously waiting for things to return to normal. Mesa, Arizona's freshly crowned Asian District was deep into organizing its night market when news broke that a case of the illness known as COVID-19 was confirmed at nearby Arizona State University. Xenophobic comments on social media and phone calls started almost immediately, according to Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce CEO Vicente Reid. тАЬI probably should stop picking up my phone altogether,"" Reid said. ""One lady was like, тАШWell, arenтАЩt people coming to your event that are the cause of it?'"" The Feb. 29 food festival, modeled after popular outdoor Taiwanese markets, was designed to get the public acquainted with the district. Mesa Mayor John Giles called the xenophobia directed at the event тАЬridiculous.тАЭ тАЬWe certainly take any health crisis seriously but to make those kinds of connections is just offensive,"" he said. Organizers will be handing out specially made masks with playful Asian-food theme slogans like тАЬBao to meтАЭ and тАЬInsert lumpia here.тАЭ The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people, mostly in China. Fifteen people have been diagnosed with the virus in the U.S., all but two who recently traveled from China. U.S. citizens have also been diagnosed abroad, including 14 who were on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan and have been brought to hospitals in the U.S. Vegetarian Dim Sum House has been a fixture in ManhattanтАЩs Chinatown for 23 years, but suddenly owner Frankie Chu said he will not be able to make his rent this month. Chu said sales have plunged 70% over the last two weeks at his no-frills restaurant. Three couples trickled in for lunch on a recent weekday. Normally, Chu said he gets up to 30 customers for lunch. At dinnertime, his narrow restaurant is usually packed with about 70 diners. These days, he gets about four. Chu has sent some of his staff on vacation to cut costs. Under the circumstances, he will ask his landlord to forgive a 5% late fee normally charged. тАЬI donтАЩt know how long I can stay here,тАЭ Chu said. тАЬAfter 9/11, it wasnтАЩt this bad.тАЭ The crisis has alarmed New York City officials and business leaders, who have launched a campaign to lure people back to hard-hit communities in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. тАЬChinatown is bleeding,тАЭ said Wellington Chen, executive chairman of the Chinatown Partnership, a local business and community group. тАЬThis thing is thousands of miles away. This fear is really out of proportion.тАЭ Small businesses in ManhattanтАЩs Chinatown have reported sales drops of between 40% and 80% the past month as the viral outbreak in China spread, Chen said. In Flushing, business is down an estimated 40%, according to the Flushing Chinese Business Association. For some businesses, itтАЩs much higher. Derek Law, senior vice chairman of the America China Hotel Association, said business has dropped about 70% at a spa he owns in Flushing. New York City is home to more than half a million Chinese Americans, the biggest population of any U.S. city. Some New Yorkers of Chinese descent are frustrated at being made to feel like foreigners because of a disease outbreak that feels as far away to them as any other resident. тАЬIтАЩm probably more American than a lot of the people asking me about coronavirus. ItтАЩs a little annoying to be honest,тАЭ said Christina Seid, owner of the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, a neighborhood fixture that her father founded four decades ago with flavor offerings like mango and green tea. Seid, whose great-grandparents immigrated to New York from China, said business has been slower than usual but added that the winter months are never good for ice cream shops. She said she feels optimistic that things will soon return to normal, relying on New Yorkers' determination to get on with life. With no confirmed cases of the virus in New York City, officials and politicians are trying to drive home the point that there is no reason to avoid any neighborhood, with many eating at Chinese restaurants and tweeting out photos under the hashtags #supportchinatown. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh has launched a similar social media campaign, encouraging people to share photos of themselves supporting small businesses in the neighborhood with the hashtag #LoveBostonChinatown. Allison Arwady, the Chicago Department of Public Health commissioner, said she and her colleagues тАЬcontinue to field rumorsтАЭ about threats to public health. She said the health risk is low and urged people to not fear visiting and spending time at restaurants or stores in Chicago's Chinatown. ""Please do not allow stigma, xenophobia or fear to control your decisions,"" Arwady said. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the situation is dire enough that Sunny WongтАЩs family is considering temporarily closing one of the four restaurants they own in Oakland Chinatown. Even some of his friends and patrons have told him about hearing of untrue rumors of people getting sick at one of his restaurants. ""People just are clueless. They hear stories and rumors and they just don't really look for the facts in a situation,"" said Wong, adding that he has had to cut back hours for his workers. Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, said business owners have reported a drop of roughly 50% to 75% in business. The chamber is planning a Chinese New Year celebration, with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf encouraging residents to patronize Chinatown restaurants. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently visited Nom Wah Tea Parlor, the oldest restaurant in Manhattan's Chinatown. The restaurant has seen a 40% drop in business over the past three weeks, said manager Vincent Tang, whose cousin Wilson Tang took over the restaurant from his father. Normally, the restaurant fills up at lunchtime. But during a recent weekday, nearly half the tables were empty, although it was at least busier than many of its lesser-known neighbors. тАЬWe're lucky to have loyal customers,тАЭ said Tang, sitting near an row of green stools that he used to swing around in as a child. тАЬUsually at this time we are packed and there is a line outside.тАЭ Customers at Nom Wah said they were perplexed that others were staying away. тАЬIt didn't cross my mind at all,тАЭ said Kate Masterson, an artist digging into dumplings with her uncle at a booth beneath signed framed photographs of celebrities like Kirsten Dunst. тАЬIt's not happening here,"" she said of the outbreak. ____ Tang reported from Mesa, Arizona.

607,"Warren Releases Extensive Plan for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders","Reappropriate Asian American feminism, politics, and pop culture Elizabeth Warren speaks at the 2019 California Democratic Party Convention. (Photo credit: Getty) Disclosure: After supporting the Castro campaign to its end, I recently indicated my public support for the Warren campaign. Coinciding with an online presidential townhall organized by Asian American and Pacific Islander advocacy groups today through the hashtag #AAPI2020 and that involved representatives of every current Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren released a comprehensive working agenda this morning that presents an extensive vision for Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities under her presidency. The plan highlighted several key planks of her campaign platform. Warren also introduced novel AANHPI-specific ideas. Warren vowed that as president, she will create a White House task force on data equity to prioritize disaggregation of federal and state demographic data. Aggregated AANHPI data has long led to the erasure of Southeast Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders for access to everything from education, healthcare, and the ballot box, and data disaggregation has been a major issue area for community advocacy groups (as well as for this blog). Warren also promised to work with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community leaders to develop other policies to better our communities. This is a vision that heralds back to the Obama administration when the White House worked in close partnership with AANHPI organizers to advance several policy initiatives and to launch the first-ever White House Summit on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. WarrenтАЩs plan is noteworthy not just for its exhaustive policy research, but also for the way in which it aligns closely with existing advocacy work advanced by AANHPI community leaders. This plan resonates as writing that not only speaks to AANHPIs but that also has been inspired by us and our work тАФ both in framing and in substance. This plan feels like it came from us; like it was developed in partnership with us. I never thought I would live to see the day when a presidential candidate would refer to the legacies of Boggs, Itliong, Vera Cruz, Korematsu and the land protectors of Mauna Kea тАФ and all in the same breath. This plan resonates as writing that not only speaks to AANHPIs but that also has been inspired by us and our work тАФ both in framing and in substance. This plan feels like it came from us; like it was developed in partnership with us. Warren also goes beyond standard fare in speaking about the issues that galvanize AANHPI voters. As evidenced by the work of AAPIData, our electorates care deeply about many issues тАФ and not just those that fit racial stereotypes of who we are, such as immigration, education, and the economy. Asian American voters, for example, are profoundly energized by issues such as climate change and gun control. Warren reflects the breadth of our political opinions and the diversity of our communities by introducing an agenda that draws widely from her campaign platform, and that includes discussion of racial justice, reproductive rights, affordable housing and the climate crisis тАФ all areas that AANHPI voters are rarely engaged on, and yet that matter deeply to (and for) us. Although many of the Democratic presidential candidates have launched campaign efforts to improve AANHPI voter and community outreach, Warren is currently the only Democratic presidential candidate to release a plan for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. In so doing, Warren has signaled a continued interest to work with our communitiesтАЩ leaders to advance real change тАФ a focus that heartens me as a budding supporter. Last month, over 140 prominent Asian Americans joined together in an open letter in support of the Warren campaign. I was one of those Asian American signatories (although I wouldnтАЩt self-describe as тАШprominentтАЩ), having made a late decision to support the Warren campaign after my first-choice candidate, Julian Castro, suspended his campaign. Although I have residual concerns about WarrenтАЩs candidacy, I am gladdened to see WarrenтАЩs campaign invest today in engaging AANHPI communities with such a comprehensive vision for our future. Asian Americans make up a sizable portion of the electorate in several large states including in Nevada, where primary caucusgoers will cast their ballots next Saturday. Yet, voters still largely split in their choice for the Democratic presidential nominee and many remain undecided, likely because nearly half of Asian American voters receive no campaign contact during any given election cycle. Warren has set an important precedent today in releasing her working agenda for AANHPI communities. I hope that other campaigns quickly follow suit, so that Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities can have a chance at being full participants in national political discourse this primary season. Anyone who wants to be president should have a vision for the future that actively includes our communities.

614,"As Nevada caucuses near, Asian Americans in valley ready to flex political strength","July 8, 2021 Currently: 92┬░ тАФ Complete forecast┬а Steve Marcus Voters wait in line to cast ballots at the Chinatown Mall on the first day of early voting for the Nevada 2020 caucus Saturday, Feb. 15, 2020. By Kelcie Grega Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2020 | 2 a.m. Christian Bato is all too familiar with the narrative that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are тАЬpolitically apathetic.тАЭ The notion plagues the already marginalized group, and in the past, has silenced their voices in elections, he said. The Las Vegas resident remembers being interested in politics from an early age when his mother and father тАФ both naturalized Filipino Americans тАФ took him with them whenever they voted. тАЬMy father made it clear to me growing up that I was born here and that IтАЩm American,тАЭ he said. тАЬI deserve to be here and I should use my voice to stand up.тАЭ Bato is a volunteer with the Asian American & Pacific Islander Democratic Caucus, a grassroots organization with the purpose of engaging eligible voters who are Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders and electing candidates to best serve the demographic. In Nevada, there are 202,091 eligible Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders voters, as the groupтАЩs population has increased 167% to 334,763 since 2000, the group reports. Sixty-one-percent of all eligible Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders voters in Nevada live in Clark County. Bato said candidates havenтАЩt always aggressively courted Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, despite the group being the fastest-growing demographic in Nevada and making up 10% of the stateтАЩs electorate. More than 70% of Asian and American registered voters said they werenтАЩt contacted by campaigns or outreach groups during the 2016 election cycle, compared to 58% of African American and 56% of white voters, according to the 2016 Post-Election National Asian American Survey. Swing state attention Asian Americans have the lowest rate of civic participation, just under Latino voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Language and cultural barriers contribute in the lack outreach, causing Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders voters to either be under informed or totally unaware of the political process entirely, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a University of California, Riverside political science professor who conducts surveys on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders voters. They are also at a geographic disadvantage, with a high concentration of them living in states that vote late in the primary and generally go blue anyway. Nevada, a battleground state in past elections and with a high Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders population, is an exception. тАЬIn 2012 and 2016, there was good Republican and Democratic investment, and a fair amount of energy in Nevada because it was a swing state,тАЭ he said. тАЬThat has meant more attention to the (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders population) community in Nevada than say states like California.тАЭ Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders population voters are also becoming increasingly aligned as Democrats, Ramakrishnan said, but this wasnтАЩt always the case. In 1992, the majority voted for George H.W. Bush, creating the impression they were a more conservative, affluent demographic than other minorities. There was a significant shift 20 years later though when in 2012, 77% of the demographic voted for Barack Obama. Although Asian Americans and Pacific Islander voters tend to be less to the left than African American voters, Democratic Party candidates still are attractive to them, with 65% choosing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders voters arenтАЩt a monolith though, Ramakrishnan notes, as they represent a wide range of ethnicities and cultures. Indian Americans for example tend to lean more left while Vietnamese Americans tend to be more conservative. Ramakrishnan expects Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to play an important role in the Democratic race in 2020 this year, particularly in Nevada as they make up a significant voting bloc of the state, which has prompted the party to pay more attention to it. Some of the same issues important to all Americans also resonate with Asian Americans, of which 13% in Nevada lack health insurance and 10% live in poverty, the group reports. тАЬWhat has changed is a greater awareness of the Asian American community and what it takes to reach out,тАЭ he said. тАЬThey can make a difference.тАЭ State Democrats pay heed The Nevada Democratic Party тАЬtook a long hard lookтАЭ at the stateтАЩs voter demographics when developing outreach strategies, bringing early voting caucus sites to areas that may have previously been left out of the process, spokeswoman Molly Forgey said. There was an early voting site in Chinatown Plaza this year and changes to caucus training material to included Tagalog, to cater to Filipino Americans, who represent the most significant Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the state. Campaigns have also been front and center at various local cultural events, including Chinese New Year in the Desert. Bato said AAPI Democratic Caucus has also enhanced its outreach toward individual groups, stressing that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders donтАЩt vote as a monolith. For example, they organized a mock caucus last month, where participants could caucus for their favorite foods like Vietnamese banh mi or Korean kimchi. While thereтАЩs been improvement, Bato said engagement was still a work in progress. For example, he isnтАЩt sure including Tagalog in caucus materials was the best use of resources, as many Filipino Americans already speak English. тАЬAs a son of Filipino immigrants, I appreciate the gesture,тАЭ he said. тАЬBut there are a whole lot of other ways we could have diversified our resources тАж maybe hiring an Asian American staffer for example.тАЭ Still, Bato hopes outsiders will recognize the perseverance of not only Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders voters in Nevada, but the diversity of the state as a whole. тАЬThe state is a microcosm of America,тАЭ he said. If you turn it on its side, it has two coasts, a rural center and everything in between.. I believe in my heart we will be a force in this caucus and election.тАЭ More photos ┬╗ ┬й Las Vegas Sun, 2021, All Rights Reserved",0,0,0,0

Besides hitting all the dominant genes for an Asian for neurobiology, microbiology, and analytical chemistry, he also is a marketer, entrepreneur, and is the principal at KB Consultations, Vice-Chair of the Cannabis Chemistry Subdivision and a cannabis advocate which makes him an outlier as well. In our advocacy, we need to bring cannabis education to Asian Americans, and we are fortunate to have Kyle at the forefront as a leader and educator. - Ophelia Chong How did you enter the cannabis industry? I began my career in cannabis at SC Laboratories, one of the first cannabis testing laboratories in the country based in Santa Cruz, CA. At the time I was studying Neuroscience at UC Santa Cruz and was looking at any and all options to stay in town. This job was well aligned with my background and interest in pursuing a career in cannabis science. During this time, I was also very involved in the electronic dance music community and frequently organized my own events. It was a fortunate introduction at one of my events through a mutual friend with one of the founders that I obtained an internship there eventually leading to my position as a Laboratory Manager. Did you do research into cannabis before entering? I always had an interest in cannabis since I was a teenager and used throughout high school and college. By the time I entered the industry I was already well seasoned in my understanding of the plant having grown my own and made my own concentrates in college. How does your family feel about your cannabis businesses? Initially, my family was not all that thrilled to find out that after helping put me through an expensive UC education that I was to start working the cannabis industry as a lowly laboratory technician. Gradually, as they began to see the tides turn especially with the release of Sanjay Gupta's: ""I Was Wrong About Weed"" and other pivotal changes such legalization in Colorado and beyond, they began to understand that this was no longer an underground and illicit trade and truly had therapeutic benefits for a variety of individuals. Additionally, they began to see that I truly was interested in the science behind it and took initiative beyond my training in college to better understand the mechanisms by which cannabis works as a medicine. The combination of these eventually led them to understand that this industry was becoming more legitimate and mainstream and that I was interested in making a positive impact by ensuring products were safe and that there was scientifically sound reasoning behind its use as a medicine. Nowadays, my parents cheer me on from the sidelines and occasionally are present at some of my presentations. I'm grateful that today they fully understand the reasons behind my involvement in the industry. What is the most frequent question you are asked about cannabis? A: From recreational and medical users I am frequently asked about what companies produce high-quality products and what attributes to look for in these products. I also have expertise in the cannabis microbiome and microbial safety testing for cannabis so I am often asked about this in the context of cultivation practices and laboratory procedures. Additionally, I recently performed a pilot study surrounding heavy metal contaminants in cannabis vaporizer cartridges so many concerned vape consumers have reached out to me with questions about hardware and harm reduction surrounding vaping. What is your favorite way of ingesting cannabis? I'm a fan of using flower vaporizers, bongs, and smoking joints, spliffs, and blunts. I am tapering off on the latter due to the health risks associated. I also vape oils and dab occasionally but I have a strong preference for the flower as I believe that processing of the plant does not deliver optimal benefits. Where do you see the cannabis industry in five years? Legalized, tightly regulated, and heavily taxed. I expect that cannabis will eventually be accepted as a medicine universally however only standardized pharmaceutical grade formulations will be allowed in medical settings. Additionally, all product manufacturers will be fully GMP and testing will be mandated for all cannabis products including hemp. Why do you think some Asians are against cannabis? There is still a large stigma surrounding cannabis in many Asian countries and just because it has started to become accepted in the United States doesn't erase many years of seemingly embedded perspectives. It's my hope that with education and advocacy we can start to shift the Asian American culture away from this stigma.┬а Kyle Boyar on Linkedin Bio: Kyle Boyar is a cannabis scientist with a background in neuroscience, microbiology, and analytical chemistry that has been working in the industry for seven years.

658,Racial and Ethnic Differences in Macular Degeneration: Asian Americans,"By Editorial Team February 14, 2020 Macular degeneration is currently the leading cause of vision loss in America. It affects more than 10 million people тАУ more than cataracts and glaucoma combined. Macular degeneration does not affect all groups of people at the same rate. It affects Caucasians more than Asian Americans, people of Hispanic/Latino background, and African Americans.1 This article covers general information about macular degeneration as well as what we know about this disease among Asian Americans. The retina is a thin layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. It is responsible for receiving light energy through the pupil and transforming that energy into signals that go to the brain.2 This is the basic process that enables us to see. Macular degeneration happens when the central part of your retina, called the macula, is damaged. This leads to impaired vision, particularly in the center of your eye. This is the area responsible for your ability to read, drive, recognize faces, and see fine detail.1 About 80 percent of people with macular degeneration have whatтАЩs known as dry AMD. In dry AMD, you develop small clumps of fatty, yellow-looking cells in the back of the eye. These clumps are called drusen.3 Over time, drusen can grow and cause more damage to your vision. There is also a less common form of macular degeneration called wet AMD. Here new blood vessels grow and leak fluid onto the macula, which causes damage.3 Although macular degeneration can develop in children and teens, by far the most cases of the disease occur in people over 50. ThatтАЩs why the condition is frequently known as age-related macular degeneration, or AMD.3 In the United States, white Americans have the highest chance of developing AMD. The numbers are lower for people of different ethnic backgrounds. So far, though, there have not been many studies looking at AMD among non-white Americans. Additionally, the limited data we have does not often look at Asian Americans as a separate ethnic group. However, that is beginning to change. As of 2010, the following number of Americans over 50 have developed AMD4: The racial difference is even greater when you look at AMD by age 804: Recent research has started to look at AMD in Asian Americans specifically. Results show that Asian Americans are not all the same when it comes to AMD. For example, one study found major differences in the risk of disease for Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, and Pakistani Americans.5 One recent research study looked at AMD in Chinese Americans, specifically. The researchers found some surprising differences compared to AMD in whites. These include6: This research is important, because Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. Now doctors will know to be on the lookout for signs of wet AMD in their Chinese-American patients, so they can work to prevent or treat any potential vision loss.6 By providing your email address, you are agreeing to our privacy policy.

673,Why Don├втВмтДвt More Asian Americans Seek Mental Health Services?,"The тАЬtrueтАЭ self may or may not exist, but our ideals and projections about it sure do. Verified by Psychology Today Posted February 6, 2020 | Reviewed by Kaja Perina By Tiffany Tran and Led Camille Soriano┬а The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) community is the fastest growing racial group in the United States, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that AA/PIs had the lowest rates of mental health utilization compared to every racial group. One study found that only 28% of Asian Americans sought mental health services compared to 54% of the general population. Because AA/PIs have been known to delay or rarely seek out help for their mental health problems, studies show their conditions are usually more severe and chronic than those of other cultural backgrounds when they do finally receive mental health care. Even so, keep in mind everyoneтАЩs mental health journey is unique, and these challenges do not apply to everyone. Culture Clash Learning how to find a balance between the individualistic, American culture and the collectivistic, Asian culture can be difficult. It can become a large source of stress and lead to a confused cultural identity. Negative mental health outcomes may result, especially to those born in the U.S. or who are second- or third-generation citizens. How are these cultural values different? Collectivistic and individualistic cultural values are: Collectivism Individual-oriented Other Asian cultural values include respect for elders/authority, putting family needs over individual needs and saving face. A family memberтАЩs success is the whole familyтАЩs success; a family memberтАЩs failure is the whole familyтАЩs failure. Your actions do not just affect you, they affect everyone. How do these cultural values get in the way of discussion about mental health in this community? Shame & Stigma Around Mental Health A strong stigma around discussing mental health and seeking out mental health care exists. Like anyone, AA/PIs may view having mental health problems as a weakness. But to speak up about them would not bring shame to themselves and the entire family. Many Asian American children are taught to uphold their familyтАЩs positive image. As a result, they may suffer in silence for extended periods of time. The fear of shame and social stigmatization plays a huge challenge in receiving mental health care and can often lead to high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear and mistrust of mental health providers. Suppression of Emotions Many AA/PIs have difficulty expressing their emotions because it is usually discouraged in Asian cultures. They may view expressing their emotions or feelings as bringing disharmony or imbalance to the family or community. This restraint can be seen as a way to avoid conflict or cause others to feel uncomfortable. Asian children are usually taught to be attentive to other peopleтАЩs emotional states and try to maintain that harmony and balance. Because the suppression of emotion is so ingrained in Asian cultural values, many studies have found that AA/PI individuals often express psychological distress through the body rather than the mind. Somatic symptoms, such as a stomachache or a headache, are usually more socially acceptable. Language Barriers A language or communication barrier can be a huge obstacle in receiving effective mental health care. Being able to express your feelings or experiences is crucial in the therapeutic process, and not having a mental health professional understand what youтАЩre saying can affect both diagnosis and treatment. It may even lead to clinical misjudgment. Additionally, the wide range of Asian languages and dialects and the lack of mental health professionals able to provide bilingual care causes a significant barrier to those in search of mental health treatment. Not being able to understand or directly translate what youтАЩre saying can be extremely frustrating and dissuade people from seeking out mental health services. Other Outlets Like many others, AA/PIs tend to turn to informal solutions for their mental health problems before seeking out mental health professionals. This includes looking for the support and advice from close friends and family. When their conditions worsen, they prefer contacting nonprofessional sources (online support, self-help strategies), healers (traditional Chinese medicine providers) or medical professionals. Religion can also play an important role in many AA/PIsтАЩ lives, so relying on faith to help them through tough times or a crisis is quite common. Many people also defer to the way of thinking such as тАЬwhatever happens, happens,тАЭ тАЬit will work itself outтАЭ and тАЬleaving it all up to God.тАЭ The culture encourages seeking out a mental health professional when symptoms become severe or unmanageable. What do we do from here? The need for more culturally competent and linguistically diverse mental health professionals is crucial for this community. Clearly, overcoming the stigma around mental health will take some time, but we hope this post will help inform others and lead to discussions about why it can be so hard to talk about mental health problems within the AA/PI community.┬а About the Authors Tiffany Tran and Led Camille Soriano are research assistants at The Menninger Clinic.

683,Why Don├втВмтДвt More Asian Americans Seek Mental Health Services?,"The тАЬtrueтАЭ self may or may not exist, but our ideals and projections about it sure do. Verified by Psychology Today Posted February 6, 2020 | Reviewed by Kaja Perina By Tiffany Tran and Led Camille Soriano┬а The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) community is the fastest growing racial group in the United States, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that AA/PIs had the lowest rates of mental health utilization compared to every racial group. One study found that only 28% of Asian Americans sought mental health services compared to 54% of the general population. Because AA/PIs have been known to delay or rarely seek out help for their mental health problems, studies show their conditions are usually more severe and chronic than those of other cultural backgrounds when they do finally receive mental health care. Even so, keep in mind everyoneтАЩs mental health journey is unique, and these challenges do not apply to everyone. Culture Clash Learning how to find a balance between the individualistic, American culture and the collectivistic, Asian culture can be difficult. It can become a large source of stress and lead to a confused cultural identity. Negative mental health outcomes may result, especially to those born in the U.S. or who are second- or third-generation citizens. How are these cultural values different? Collectivistic and individualistic cultural values are: Collectivism Individual-oriented Other Asian cultural values include respect for elders/authority, putting family needs over individual needs and saving face. A family memberтАЩs success is the whole familyтАЩs success; a family memberтАЩs failure is the whole familyтАЩs failure. Your actions do not just affect you, they affect everyone. How do these cultural values get in the way of discussion about mental health in this community? Shame & Stigma Around Mental Health A strong stigma around discussing mental health and seeking out mental health care exists. Like anyone, AA/PIs may view having mental health problems as a weakness. But to speak up about them would not bring shame to themselves and the entire family. Many Asian American children are taught to uphold their familyтАЩs positive image. As a result, they may suffer in silence for extended periods of time. The fear of shame and social stigmatization plays a huge challenge in receiving mental health care and can often lead to high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear and mistrust of mental health providers. Suppression of Emotions Many AA/PIs have difficulty expressing their emotions because it is usually discouraged in Asian cultures. They may view expressing their emotions or feelings as bringing disharmony or imbalance to the family or community. This restraint can be seen as a way to avoid conflict or cause others to feel uncomfortable. Asian children are usually taught to be attentive to other peopleтАЩs emotional states and try to maintain that harmony and balance. Because the suppression of emotion is so ingrained in Asian cultural values, many studies have found that AA/PI individuals often express psychological distress through the body rather than the mind. Somatic symptoms, such as a stomachache or a headache, are usually more socially acceptable. Language Barriers A language or communication barrier can be a huge obstacle in receiving effective mental health care. Being able to express your feelings or experiences is crucial in the therapeutic process, and not having a mental health professional understand what youтАЩre saying can affect both diagnosis and treatment. It may even lead to clinical misjudgment. Additionally, the wide range of Asian languages and dialects and the lack of mental health professionals able to provide bilingual care causes a significant barrier to those in search of mental health treatment. Not being able to understand or directly translate what youтАЩre saying can be extremely frustrating and dissuade people from seeking out mental health services. Other Outlets Like many others, AA/PIs tend to turn to informal solutions for their mental health problems before seeking out mental health professionals. This includes looking for the support and advice from close friends and family. When their conditions worsen, they prefer contacting nonprofessional sources (online support, self-help strategies), healers (traditional Chinese medicine providers) or medical professionals. Religion can also play an important role in many AA/PIsтАЩ lives, so relying on faith to help them through tough times or a crisis is quite common. Many people also defer to the way of thinking such as тАЬwhatever happens, happens,тАЭ тАЬit will work itself outтАЭ and тАЬleaving it all up to God.тАЭ The culture encourages seeking out a mental health professional when symptoms become severe or unmanageable. What do we do from here? The need for more culturally competent and linguistically diverse mental health professionals is crucial for this community. Clearly, overcoming the stigma around mental health will take some time, but we hope this post will help inform others and lead to discussions about why it can be so hard to talk about mental health problems within the AA/PI community.┬а About the Authors Tiffany Tran and Led Camille Soriano are research assistants at The Menninger Clinic.

721,Misguided virus fears hitting Asian American businesses,"WSPA 7News by: The Associated Press In this Feb. 13, 2020, photo, Vincent Tang, manager of ManhattanтАЩs Chinatown oldest restaurant, Nom Wah Tea Parlor, speaks during an interview at the establishment started by his father, in New York. The restaurant has seen a 40% drop in business over the past three weeks, said Tang. тАЬWeтАЩre lucky to have loyal customers.тАЭ (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) NEW YORK (AP) тАФ In Arizona, a burgeoning Asian American community fields xenophobic calls about a planned night market featuring Asian street foods. In New York, a dim sum restaurant owner worries he wonтАЩt make rent. In the San Francisco Bay Area, a local Asian American-owned restaurant chain is mulling temporarily shuttering one of its properties because of the downturn in trade. In major U.S. cities, Asian American businesses are seeing a remarkable decline in customers as fear about the viral outbreak from China spreads. City and health officials are trying to staunch the financial bleeding through information campaigns and personal visits to shops and restaurants, emphasizing that, with just 15 cases diagnosed in the entire country, there is no reason to avoid them. Business owners, some of whom have seen their customer traffic cut by more than half, are anxiously waiting for things to return to normal. Mesa, ArizonaтАЩs freshly crowned Asian District was deep into organizing its night market when news broke that a case of the illness known as COVID-19 was confirmed at nearby Arizona State University. Xenophobic comments on social media and phone calls started almost immediately, according to Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce CEO Vicente Reid. тАЬI probably should stop picking up my phone altogether,тАЭ Reid said. тАЬOne lady was like, тАШWell, arenтАЩt people coming to your event that are the cause of it?'тАЭ The Feb. 29 food festival, modeled after popular outdoor Taiwanese markets, was designed to get the public acquainted with the district. Mesa Mayor John Giles called the xenophobia directed at the event тАЬridiculous.тАЭ тАЬWe certainly take any health crisis seriously but to make those kinds of connections is just offensive,тАЭ he said. Organizers will be handing out specially made masks with playful Asian-food theme slogans like тАЬBao to meтАЭ and тАЬInsert lumpia here.тАЭ The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people, mostly in China. Fifteen people have been diagnosed with the virus in the U.S., all but two who recently traveled from China. U.S. citizens have also been diagnosed abroad, including 14 who were on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan and have been brought to hospitals in the U.S. Vegetarian Dim Sum House has been a fixture in ManhattanтАЩs Chinatown for 23 years, but suddenly owner Frankie Chu said he will not be able to make his rent this month. Chu said sales have plunged 70% over the last two weeks at his no-frills restaurant. Three couples trickled in for lunch on a recent weekday. Normally, Chu said he gets up to 30 customers for lunch. At dinnertime, his narrow restaurant is usually packed with about 70 diners. These days, he gets about four. Chu has sent some of his staff on vacation to cut costs. Under the circumstances, he will ask his landlord to forgive a 5% late fee normally charged. тАЬI donтАЩt know how long I can stay here,тАЭ Chu said. тАЬAfter 9/11, it wasnтАЩt this bad.тАЭ The crisis has alarmed New York City officials and business leaders, who have launched a campaign to lure people back to hard-hit communities in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. тАЬChinatown is bleeding,тАЭ said Wellington Chen, executive chairman of the Chinatown Partnership, a local business and community group. тАЬThis thing is thousands of miles away. This fear is really out of proportion.тАЭ Small businesses in ManhattanтАЩs Chinatown have reported sales drops of between 40% and 80% the past month as the viral outbreak in China spread, Chen said. In Flushing, business is down an estimated 40%, according to the Flushing Chinese Business Association. For some businesses, itтАЩs much higher. Derek Law, senior vice chairman of the America China Hotel Association, said business has dropped about 70% at a spa he owns in Flushing. New York City is home to more than half a million Chinese Americans, the biggest population of any U.S. city. Some New Yorkers of Chinese descent are frustrated at being made to feel like foreigners because of a disease outbreak that feels as far away to them as any other resident. тАЬIтАЩm probably more American than a lot of the people asking me about coronavirus. ItтАЩs a little annoying to be honest,тАЭ said Christina Seid, owner of the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, a neighborhood fixture that her father founded four decades ago with flavor offerings like mango and green tea. Seid, whose great-grandparents immigrated to New York from China, said business has been slower than usual but added that the winter months are never good for ice cream shops. She said she feels optimistic that things will soon return to normal, relying on New YorkersтАЩ determination to get on with life. With no confirmed cases of the virus in New York City, officials and politicians are trying to drive home the point that there is no reason to avoid any neighborhood, with many eating at Chinese restaurants and tweeting out photos under the hashtags #supportchinatown. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh has launched a similar social media campaign, encouraging people to share photos of themselves supporting small businesses in the neighborhood with the hashtag #LoveBostonChinatown. Allison Arwady, the Chicago Department of Public Health commissioner, said she and her colleagues тАЬcontinue to field rumorsтАЭ about threats to public health. She said the health risk is low and urged people to not fear visiting and spending time at restaurants or stores in ChicagoтАЩs Chinatown. тАЬPlease do not allow stigma, xenophobia or fear to control your decisions,тАЭ Arwady said. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the situation is dire enough that Sunny WongтАЩs family is considering temporarily closing one of the four restaurants they own in Oakland Chinatown. Even some of his friends and patrons have told him about hearing of untrue rumors of people getting sick at one of his restaurants. тАЬPeople just are clueless. They hear stories and rumors and they just donтАЩt really look for the facts in a situation,тАЭ said Wong, adding that he has had to cut back hours for his workers. Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, said business owners have reported a drop of roughly 50% to 75% in business. The chamber is planning a Chinese New Year celebration, with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf encouraging residents to patronize Chinatown restaurants. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently visited Nom Wah Tea Parlor, the oldest restaurant in ManhattanтАЩs Chinatown. The restaurant has seen a 40% drop in business over the past three weeks, said manager Vincent Tang, whose cousin Wilson Tang took over the restaurant from his father. Normally, the restaurant fills up at lunchtime. But during a recent weekday, nearly half the tables were empty, although it was at least busier than many of its lesser-known neighbors. тАЬWeтАЩre lucky to have loyal customers,тАЭ said Tang, sitting near an row of green stools that he used to swing around in as a child. тАЬUsually at this time we are packed and there is a line outside.тАЭ Customers at Nom Wah said they were perplexed that others were staying away. тАЬIt didnтАЩt cross my mind at all,тАЭ said Kate Masterson, an artist digging into dumplings with her uncle at a booth beneath signed framed photographs of celebrities like Kirsten Dunst. тАЬItтАЩs not happening here,тАЭ she said of the outbreak. ____ Tang reported from Mesa, Arizona.

937,Texas teen attempts to kill Asian American family ├втВмтАЭ including young children ├втВмтАЭ because he thought they were Chinese and spreading coronavirus,"At least now we know how to trigger the chattering classes. Just utter the phrase тАШpersonal responsibilityтАЩ. Judging by yesterdayтАЩs mad, spittle-flying meltdown in response to Boris JohnsonтАЩs announcement that Covid restrictions will end on 19 July, no two words horrify the Smart Set more. тАШWhat do you mean trust people to decide for themselves how to negotiate risk and organise their lives?!тАЩ, they were essentially crying. It was a salutary and, letтАЩs be frank, unwittingly hilarious reminder that the self-styled expert classes are in the grip of a fretful, fearful illiberalism that views the masses as vectors of disease rather than as sensible individuals capable of behaving rationally. We may have tamed Covid-19; the next big task is to tame, and ideally defeat, this virus of misanthropy that has been allowed to let rip for too long in the ranks of the new elites. You could be forgiven for thinking Boris had passed a law making it mandatory for every citizen to snog someone infected with Covid. The response was that mad. Lifting restrictions while the Delta variant is spreading is not unlike doing away with тАШall traffic lights, road markings, speed limits and seat beltsтАЩ, said one-time comic turned Remoaning madman David Schneider. Social media was awash with predictions of doom and death. Lockdown leftists тАУ who used to call Boris a fascist but who now view him as some kind of daddy figure who should have the right to put us under house arrest whenever he damn well pleases тАУ said тАШpersonal responsibilityтАЩ is a mad idea in a pandemic. The GuardianтАЩs frontpage splash this morning says Boris is taking a тАШgambleтАЩ with peopleтАЩs lives. HeтАЩs making England тАШthe most unrestricted society in EuropeтАЩ. The horror! You can picture Guardian readers up and down the land: тАШFreedom? I knew we should have stayed in the EU.тАЩ The masks discussion was the maddest of all тАУ and the most revealing. Serious commentators fumed at BorisтАЩs confirmation that even masks will no longer be legally mandated come 19 July. тАШWell, IтАЩm going to continue wearing mine!тАЩ, some cried. All this тАШwhimpering about libertyтАЩ is nauseating, said a writer for the Independent тАУ masks are a тАШsmall impositionтАЩ with huge benefits, he claimed. WeтАЩre heading for the great mask divide, arenтАЩt we? Masks are going to become the latest tool of moral distancing, a way for the right-thinking sections of the bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the coughing, snorting throng. It used to be AIDS ribbons or cancer bracelets and more recently a Pride flag dangling from your living-room window тАУ now itтАЩll be a bit of cloth over your gob, material proof that, unlike Them, you care. The mask meltdown in particular captured what is really going on here. Sections of the elite are bristling against the lifting of restrictions not because the stats suggest we are heading for another wave as deadly as the first and second тАУ they suggest no such thing тАУ but because they fear other people. Our faces, our breath, the noises we make. Masks will тАШprovide an extra layer of defence from the person an inch from your face on the Northern line who hasnтАЩt cleaned their teethтАЩ, said that Indie columnist. In the future we will тАШlook back in disbelief at the way we once breathed and snorted and coughed over each other, letting germs and bugs run riotтАЩ, he argued. A masked society, in which we all enjoy a modicum of protection from other peopleтАЩs germ-ridden expressions, is тАШheavenтАЩ, he says. Translation: Hell is other people. This view of the crowd as a potentially diseased menace is not limited to opinion writers. Experts proffer such anti-social, anti-human thinking, too. Professor Susan Michie of SAGE said letting people get back to normal right now is like тАШbuilding new тАЬvariant factoriesтАЭтАШ. Prophet of doom Deepti Gurdasani agreed: тАШThe UK is creating these factories, knowing the risks.тАЩ It seems that to some people this is what freedom is, this is what society is тАУ little more than cauldrons of infection, a messy, breathy, flesh-pressing means for sicknesses to mutate and get worse and worse. That experts can openly talk about freely associating individuals as тАШvariant factoriesтАЩ confirms the extent of their Covid obsessiveness, the fact that they now view everything тАУ freedom, human interaction, society itself тАУ in the narrow, technocratic terms of whether it will create more space for Covid to spread. To paraphrase Wilde, these people know the R-number of everything and the value of nothing. Some calm, objective reality needs to be marshalled against these Covid obsessives who now trade more in dread than science. As Nick Triggle of the BBC says, it really is time for us all to тАШthink differently about CovidтАЩ. The hugely successful vaccine rollout has changed everything. And those who implicitly deny this fact тАУ the scientists, celebs and op-ed types who warn of great future horrors if we open up now тАУ are essentially doing down the vaccine miracle. TheyтАЩre anti-vaxxers in all but name. Triggle points out that in January one in 10 infections led to a hospital admission; now itтАЩs somewhere between one in 40 and one in 50. In January one in 60 infections led to someone dying; now itтАЩs less than one in 1,000. Hospitalisations and deaths are not rising, even though the Delta variant is spreading and we are now in a third wave. And those who are being hospitalised tend to be a lot less sick than those who were hospitalised during the first and second waves. Many donтАЩt need intensive treatment. This is good, no? ItтАЩs great, in fact. We have deployed our scientific knowledge and medical know-how to break the link between Covid infection and serious illness. So why the fear? The gloom? The horror at the prospect of a restoration of liberty? Because this isnтАЩt actually about Covid. Not entirely, anyway. As spiked has argued from the very beginning of the pandemic, Covid-19 is a very serious virus that requires strong interventions from society, but the cultural rendering of Covid as a sickly apocalypse, a pox mankind brought upon himself with all his modernity and whatnot, a disease that will require the creation of a New Normal that just happens to conform to the anti-social, anti-masses outlook of the new elites тАУ all of that was underpinned by a culture of fear that predated the emergence of Covid-19. What we have in the meltdown over the return of liberty is the clearest illustration yet that it is politics and prejudice that are motoring the middle classesтАЩ attachment to lockdown, not data. The desire to stay socially distanced from the variant-creating throng for as long as possible is in many ways the nadir of the misanthropic ideologies that pass for тАШprogressive thoughtтАЩ among the new elites. From their conviction that the vote for Brexit confirms we live in a nation of pig-ignorant people to their environmentalist belief that humanity is pretty much a plague on the planet, from their nanny-state panic about the follies and fatness of Joe Average and his kids to their obsession with creating Safe Spaces so that they can hide away from the gruff un-PC thoughts of the rest of us, the new elites have been morally distancing themselves from the plebs for a very long time. Now they want to make their separation physical, too тАУ social distancing to complement their moral distancing. Enough is enough. Boris needs to stand firm against the tsunami of lockdown fanaticism that is going to come his way from the media between now and 19 July, against all the shrill voices demanding that we keep restrictions until September or winter or forever. We cannot allow society to be organised according to the whims and fears of the neurotic middle classes. Of the kind of people who think everything gives you cancer and feeding your children fruit loops will drive them mad with E-numbers and driving to the supermarket once a week literally contributes to the death of a polar bear. Reason needs to make a comeback. It wonтАЩt come from the jaundiced elites who flat-out no longer trust ordinary people. Orwell knew. If there is hope, we know where it lies.

1052,How Yang's Presidential Bid May Affect Asian American Voters,"DAVID GREENE, HOST: Democrats running for president are now turning their attention to states with much more diversity. Nevada's primary is next, and while candidates will undoubtedly be courting the Latino vote there, it's also worth noting Nevada's the first state in the primary season to have a sizable Asian American population as well. Now, Asian Americans, we should say, have been brought into this election conversation like never before, thanks to this guy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREW YANG: Hello, I'm Andrew Yang. And I'm running for president as a Democrat in 2020. (CHEERING) GREENE: Now, while the entrepreneur dropped out after New Hampshire, activists say what his campaign did for Asian American political engagement will have lasting effects. And let's talk about this with Christine Chen. She's in our Washington studio. She's director of the nonprofit Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Thanks for coming in. CHRISTINE CHEN: Thank you. GREENE: So what did Andrew Yang's run for president mean for your efforts to get the Asian American community more engaged in politics? CHEN: Just for the fact that Andrew Yang ran a wonderful presidential campaign and made it this far, he's really changed the image and the narrative of how Asian Americans are seen, that we can actually be seen as those who are politically active and are looking to run for office. In addition, he was able to galvanize a new segment of the Asian American population to actually become donors, as well as to actually get involved in canvassing operations and getting involved. GREENE: I mean, we should say he actually didn't poll that well with Asian Americans. So do you make a distinction there, I mean, even for people who weren't necessarily going to vote for him, that they felt that he had an impact on their interest? CHEN: You know, Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are looking for a long-term relationship. So I think they were just starting to get to know Andrew Yang. But we have to give him credit for, once again, galvanizing a new segment of a population of donors, young donors specifically, that we've never seen participate in the past. GREENE: Can you say at this point if there are certain candidates who seem to be reaching out to and connecting to Asian American voters, or is it too early to really conclude anything? CHEN: You know what? I'm really excited about the 2020 elections just because never before have I seen presidential candidates early on during the primary season hire Asian American-Pacific Islander outreach directors and to even embed and to, early on in 2019, meet with Asian American community leaders and voters in Nevada as well as in Iowa. So we're already seeing a shift in terms of how they're looking at the voters and how they're actually embedding campaign staff to actually reach out to them. GREENE: You know, when I cover campaigns, I hate saying, like, there are certain issues that are important to certain groups. So we should say that. But let me just you, I mean, what sorts of issues come up as you speak to the voters who you focus on? CHEN: So even though Asian American-Pacific Islander is a diverse category, based on our polling the last four years, the same - a lot of the same issues of economy, education and health care continue to resonate. And also, surprisingly, a lot people don't necessarily think about reaching out to Asian American voters to talk about gun control - 7 to 1 voters, Asian American voters, actually are supportive of that. GREENE: Supportive of stricter gun control. CHEN: Correct. GREENE: What role does Nevada play? I mean, is this an important test for Asian American interests in 2020? CHEN: It is. I mean, even in 2016, when we saw an increase of participation leaving Nevada, it actually set us up for Super Tuesday. And now that California has shifted, we're going to see Super Tuesday - where there's a sizable - like, over 15% of the electorate is Asian American. And you also have states like Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts and Minnesota that have sizable Asian populations. GREENE: All right. Christine Chen, director of Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Thanks so much for coming in. CHEN: Great. Thank you.

1119,Asian Americans Advancing Justice Issues Statement on Details of New Public Charge Rule Which Goes Into Effect Today,"Norcross, GA, February 24, 2020 тАФ Today, on February 24, 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland SecurityтАЩs (DHS) final public charge rule will go into effect nationwide. The new DHS rule made sweeping changes to the previous тАЬpublic chargeтАЭ test and will disproportionately block lower-income immigrants of color from obtaining lawful permanent residency, getting a green card. The expanded public charge rule also will make it harder for immigrant workers and international foreign students from extending or changing their visas and undermine the ability of green card holders to re-enter the U.S. if they have spent more than six months abroad. Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an affiliation of five civil rights organizations, issues the following statement: тАЬWe are extremely disappointed with the U.S. Supreme CourtтАЩs intervention to implement the Trump administrationтАЩs changes to the public charge rule. However, litigation proceeds on the merits in the lower courts. Moreover, the State DepartmentтАЩs parallel public charge regulation, which governs how the test is implemented abroad, is also set to go into effect today. On Friday, February 21, 2020, a New York federal district court denied a motion that would prevent the DOS rule from going into effect on February 24, and the Trump administration has issued the final forms and manual changes required to implement the regulation. We condemn these racist policies, which seek to dramatically undermine the family-based immigration system that has been the backbone of our country and instead prioritizes wealthy and white immigrants. The public charge rule change continues the administrationтАЩs inhumane assault on immigrant families by increasing denials of green card applicants. Public benefits are essential in helping families stay healthy and thrive. Weighing the likelihood of future benefits use, along with discriminatory factors such as English language proficiency, is unjust, unnecessary, and does not strengthen the country. The administration has intentionally sought to scare immigrants and their families from using public benefits. Since the rule change was proposed at the end of 2018, over 13% of immigrant adults are reported to have dropped their use of public benefits out of fear of risking their future green card status. With the rules now final, the effect will be even more devastating for our communities. As a nation, we should prioritize accessible pathways to lawful permanent residency and eventual citizenship, reuniting families, and helping them succeed. Immigrant families deserve the right to reunite with their loved ones and use programs to ensure they are healthy, safe, and thriving. We will continue to fight against the many attacks on immigrants and their families.тАЭ Please remember the following: The public charge rule does not apply to all immigrantsтАФthere are many exceptions. Many benefits are not considered in the public charge assessment. Only benefits used by the applicant for Legal Permanent Resident status are considered under the DHS rules. Different rules may apply to immigrants seeking visas from outside the U.S. Public Charge Background and Important Information: The new rule dramatically expands the types of public benefits that many eligible immigrants need based on the new public charge rules. Prior to the changes, only cash assistance, such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Social Security Income (SSI), or institutional care paid for by Medicaid would be the basis of exclusion because of public charge grounds. Now, the use of supplemental health, nutrition or housing benefits that millions of working Americans rely upon, such as non-emergency Medicaid, food stamps, and subsidized housing, may be considered. The rule will also impose an unprecedented test, assigning positive and negative weight to a range of five factors, to assess future benefits use that will penalize legal immigrants. Especially immigrant seniors and all immigrants who are low-income, lack English language proficiency, have chronic medical conditions and lack access to private health insurance, and who have not had access to educational opportunities. According to a report by Migration Policy Institute, more than 941,000 recent green card holders, including approximately 300,000 from Asian countries, would likely have been excluded if the rule had already been in effect when they applied. Though more than 260,000 public comments submitted, DHS published a final regulation that departed only slightly from the proposed version. Despite several court decisions stopping the implementation of the final public charge rule, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on January 27, 2020, to allow the DHS public charge rule to take effect nationwide while lawsuits continue (except for Illinois, where the rule remains blocked by a statewide injunction). However, per DHS, the final rule will only apply to applications submitted on or after February 24, 2020. Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps), HUD public housing, and тАЬSection 8тАЭ housing benefits received before February 24, 2020, will not be considered in the public charge determination.

While England exulted at reaching a first major final since 1966, there was increasing outcry abroad over the penalty awarded for a foul on Raheem Sterling in extra time to give them a 2-1 win over Denmark in their Euro 2020 semi-final. An array of media and football figures joined Danish fans in condemning the penalty as too cheap for such a big game, some saying England's haughty views on diving looked hypocritical in view of Sterling's tumble at the lightest of touches.

1375,Trump & Cornyn├втВмтДвs Coronavirus Racism Puts Asian Americans in Danger - Muslim Advocates,"March 19, 2020 Issues: Coronavirus, Fighting Bigotry, Hate Crimes Press Release Share this page with your family and friends Or copy this link to share Washington, DC тАФ In recent days, President Trump began using the phrase тАЬChinese VirusтАЭ to describe the coronavirus. This puts Asian Americans in harmтАЩs way and is yet another example of the presidentтАЩs long history of attacking communities of color. This bigotry is also spreading to other leading public officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sen. John Cornyn, who recently responded to a question about coronavirus by blaming China and citing тАЬthe culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.тАЭ The following is a statement from Muslim Advocates Executive Director Farhana Khera: тАЬDuring a time of national crisis when many Americans are scared and suffering, we need our leaders to unite the country, not divide us for political gain. President TrumpтАЩs use of the term тАШChinese VirusтАЩ to describe the coronavirus is vile and a distraction. Sen. CornynтАЩs embrace of schoolyard, anti-Asian stereotypes about eating bats and dogs is deeply offensive and wonтАЩt help us fight the virus. Racism is not a disinfectant. These harmful words have serious, real-world consequences. By whipping up anti-Asian hysteria, President Trump, Cornyn and other public officials resorting to xenophobia are giving people a license to hate and threaten Asian Americans. LetтАЩs be clear: President Trump and his allies are once again stoking racism to distract from the truth: his administration has failed to protect the American people from possibly the gravest health and economic catastrophe in our lifetimes. President Trump, we are in a crisis. Do your job.

1457,Being Asian American in the Midst of COVID-19,"(in)courage by Grace P. Cho Mar 30, 2020 72 Comments 1698 Shares I can feel my voice getting louder as the white family passes us by, my words coming out more crisply and clearly than I normally would talk. I canтАЩt control the instinctual reaction of my body when thereтАЩs even the slightest chance I might be perceived as тАЬone of them.тАЭ IтАЩm not other or foreign (I was born here in California), but with the way Asian Americans are being treated in light of COVID-19, I canтАЩt help but feel labeled as dirty, sick, a virus тАФ the virus. I enunciate my words and speak just loudly enough to be heard because I want everyone who walks by and gives us even the slightest of second glances to know that IтАЩm American, just like them. I want them to know that being Asian American doesnтАЩt make me more susceptible to getting sick. ItтАЩs knowing this disease is being used against people who look like me that gets me sick. Asian Americans are being spat on, beaten down, bullied. Asian restaurants were being avoided long before all non-essential businesses were getting shut down. On top of the fear and stress we all carry concerning the health and safety of our loved ones, racism against Asian Americans adds another layer to the anxiety, and we are weary. IтАЩm almost glad weтАЩre being told to stay at home so as to avoid the chance IтАЩll be the next recipient of prejudice and xenophobia, but then I watch the news and keep hearing coronavirus referred to as тАЬthe Chinese virusтАЭ by our president, and I know itтАЩs not over yet. Words can be wielded for good or for harm, and those are not neutral words. I find relief and solidarity as I hear more Asian Americans speaking up about the impact this term is having. We share the collective toll this is taking on our souls, but will others be able to see it too? I write this knowing some wonтАЩt understand, that some will say, тАЬWhatтАЩs the big deal? It came from China anyway, right?тАЭ And yet, I have to write this because the more we become aware, the more we listen and try to understand each otherтАЩs experiences and stories, the more we recognize the humanity in one another. Perhaps when we do, weтАЩll learn to think twice before we speak and act, before we mistreat someone who looks or acts differently from us, before we categorize people as тАЬless thanтАЭ in our hearts, minds, with our words, and even with our policies. IтАЩve been ruminating on how Jesus looked at people with compassion тАФ people who were distressed and sick, people who were unclean and dying, people who were stubborn and naive and didnтАЩt understand Him. I imagine what His eyes of compassion looked like, and the face of a Middle Eastern man with brown skin and brown eyes comes to mind. He looks at the crowd, at the rich young ruler, at the woman whose son has died, and His eyes soften. I imagine Him on the cross looking at John and His beloved mother, love spilling over for His people in His last breaths, and His eyes soften. He sees their pain and grief, their hunger, their blindness тАФ both physical and spiritual. He sees their humanity, and His love for them changes the way He looks at them. In a time when control is out of our hands, when fear and anxiety rule our hearts and cause panic and pain for others, I become overwhelmed and all my words seem useless. But like clay in my hands, I shape them into crude prayers тАФ Lord, please. Help. Heal. Have mercy. I pray for the people who hoard and steal out of fear or because they can. I pray for lawmakers and leaders in our nation and in our churches. I pray for Asian Americans and those who spit on us, judge us, and hurt us. I pray for the sick, the dying, the vulnerable, the ones exposed and those who wonтАЩt be able to recover from this. My prayers come out in tears, while lying awake in bed, while kneading dough to make bread, while playing with my children at home, while reading updates on the news. I pray for eyes of compassion that lead to justice and generosity and for our lives to look more like JesusтАЩ when He lived on earth as human тАФ absorbing the pain of others, overturning the tables of the greedy, making seen the outcast, welcoming the foreigner, comforting the lonely, exposing the systems that are cracked and in need of redemption. I pray we all come out of this time broken but kinder, weary but with a clearer vision for how to be human.┬а Your first email is on the way.

Bev @ Walking Well With God says March 30, 2020 at 5:09 am Grace, Thank you for this very vulnerable post that allows me to walk in your shoes for a short while. This reminds me, a bit, of when, during the war with Japan, in WWII we rounded up all Japanese Americans and forced them into internment camps. Thousands of everyday Americans were treated like spies and spent three or more years in these camps just because of their roots. I canтАЩt even fathom what it must be like to be lumped together like that. ItтАЩs sad to realize that the river of prejudice still runs wide. It still separates by color, ethnicity, religion, etc. Jesus was a Middle Eastern man, very likely with dark skin and eyes. Today, in Pakistan (during this COVID-19 crisis), Christians are being discriminated against in receiving food relief from NGOтАЩs. Everyone else is receiving assistance, but not the ones who would most closely identify with Jesus because they are called тАЬthe unclean ones.тАЭ I join you in praying for our world тАУ that we would band together in our humanity and not separate and segregate based on the arbitrary lines we draw. Blessings, Bev xx Bunny Harrison says March 30, 2020 at 9:52 am I am so sorry prejudice has reared its ugly head in your life! Please know when we pray we are praying all GodтАЩs creatures are protected from harm тАУ physically and spiritually. Also, convert those who fear to trust that the work of compassion, mercy will become preeminent in their lives. Thank you for being so open, you touched my heart. Grace P.

Allowing us to walk in your shoes & understand what it must be like. Prejudice has been around since the dawn of man. Even the pharisees wouldnтАЩt associate with тАЬcertain peopleтАЭ-mostly Samaritans. There has always been & will always be a sense of тАЬIтАЩm better than youтАЭ attitude. Blacks-African Americans & Jews have been persecuted for years. All it takes is ignorant people who canтАЩt see beyond the skin. They donтАЩt take the time to get to know the people-really know you. What we need now is a huge revival in our country. Christians banding together-via computer- & praying hard for this nation & the world. We all need to have the sensitivity of Jesus. To be able to look at people with compassion & love-to see them as we are flawed humans in need of a Savior. Not Asians, Jews, blacks, etc. Praying for all concerned in this pandemic. May God bring an end to it & the bigotry surrounding it quickly! Blessings ЁЯЩВ Karen says March 30, 2020 at 9:12 am I love your idea of a Christian revival in this country via computer! Grace P.

Unfortunately this attitude has gone on since the beginning of time whenever someone is different, the us vs. them thing. Christ came for everyone to show us we are all valuable and worthy and loved.

Your skin color should have nothing to do with it. Especially at this time Grace. Especially with this coronvaries. No one has right to judge or say this or this. You remember you are a Daughter of the King and what Jesus says about you is all that matters. Like that kids song. I learnt in Sunday School when small it sticks in my mind at this time. Jesus Loves all the Children of the World Red and Yellow Black and White. We are his Children. More so if Saved. So we are to do the same especially if save love all people of walks of life all colors of skin and not judge them. As we are not the Judge. Jesus is the only judge of the world. I had a true friend alot older than me. Who is now in Glory. Who taught me alot as follower of Jesus. Instead of talking about that person and say your only saying she used to say. Your not only saying. Your judging in Gods eyes. Why donтАЩt you pray for them. She was so so right in what she said. Here words today now she is gone ring even more true to me than ever more to me in these times. Plus she said another true thing. Bidden or not Bidden God is watching. Meaning God sees everything we do. So we have to careful. What we do and say. Like another song I learnt at Sunday School when small. It is be Oh Be Careful little eyes what you see there is a Father up above who is watching. Then it went on the song to say Oh Be Careful little mouth what you Say there is a Father up above who is watching. How true theses songs are and the words of my friend who is now in Glory. So in these time we are in we donтАЩt have to listen or let the Old Devil tempt us to get hurt by Mans words. Because of skin color or the way we look. Especially if we are saved. What is most important is what the Bible says about us. What God thinks of us not MAN. Look up on Youtube the FatherтАЩs Love Leter. Just type in on Youtube the words the FatherтАЩs Love Letter. You will hear how much your heavenly Father God Loves you. So you then can close your ears to Man and the Old Devil using him to get to you. Because of your skin color. As after listening to it will not annoy you. You will sing the songs I have put on here. Also know you are a Daughter of the King of the world who is Jesus who finds you just Beautiful. That is all that matters. Not what man or anyone else thinks. Love Dawn Ferguson-Little xxx Grace P. Cho says April 6, 2020 at 12:45 am Thanks for your message, Dawn! Robin Sims says March 30, 2020 at 7:06 am My heart breaks to know that Asian Americans are treated like you described. I live in the middle southern section of our country and had no idea this was going on until I read your words. It is my prayer that all people who treat others with such disdain due to their race find Christ in the midst of all that is going around. May our nation once again be called a Christian nation. Lydia says March 30, 2020 at 7:24 am Thank you for sharing your story and your hurts with us today! It is sad how people treat others and I do hope that through this people will come out of it better. Better in understanding. Better in attitude. Better in communication. Better at not judging or holding onto contempt. Better at seeing Jesus is the Hope of the World. I will add these things to my prayers, to pray for those being discriminated against in a very real and unfair way and for those doing the discriminating. As the Kevin Costner character says in тАЬHidden FiguresтАЭ: тАЬat Nasa we all pee the same colour!тАЭ Hold fast to the truth that you are loved.

I was beyond appalled when I heard COVID-19 referred to as the тАЬChinese VirusтАЭ during a press conference. At a time when our nation needs to come together, our leader is dividing and isolating. My hope and prayer is that we will find a way to come together for all Americans (and people throughout the world) who are struggling with this pandemic. May your family be safe, happy and healthy!

And IтАЩm with the one who suggested we used this time to Pray for our country and let revival come in. IтАЩm praying for it and hearts and minds to be healed. For us to surrender to the Lord ask for forgiveness and be in relationship with him again. Adora says March 30, 2020 at 8:56 am Thanks Grace! I do the same with making sure people hear that I can speak perfect English тАУ and then I remind myself that it shouldnтАЩt matter if I do or not. IтАЩve been receiving strange looks in grocery stores for weeks, watching people dodge me or sanitise right after I pass by, and itтАЩs embarrassing and dehumanising. Last week, my neighbour came after me screaming racial insults and swearing. ItтАЩs easy to get discouraged. What gives me hope though, is when church leaders will include their stance against racism in their message week after week. It gives me hope to read through the Psalms and through the gospels and remember that this is not new, that God isnтАЩt surprised or challenged. It gives me hope when people can move past the, тАЬjust ignore themтАЭ phase, and really listen and commit to taking action. And it makes me feel safe when IтАЩm in a space that recognises that these divides existed already and that IтАЩm not тАЬbeing divisiveтАЭ by speaking out against abuse. тЩея╕П Grace P.

Cho says April 6, 2020 at 12:51 am Thank you, Loretta! Lynn D. Morrissey says March 30, 2020 at 11:18 am Dear Grace, your post moves me a great deal, and I canтАЩt tell you how sorry and saddened I am over such responses of fear and prejudice leveled against Asian Americans, and Asians, period. IтАЩm of European descent, and likely people of my complexion are those spewing (literally and figuratively) such vitriol on our Asian friends. You donтАЩt say specifically, but I presume it, based on what I myself witness in the news and online. President Trump should not continue to identify COVID 19 as тАЬthe Chinese flu,тАЭ because of the unnecessary havoc that creates, as you delineate in your post. I understand that past names of flu epidemics (like West Nile Virus and Spanish Flu) were a way to identify a flu source. However, in this age of instant communication and the likes of social media, such identification quickly morphs into unfounded prejudice in a nation already filled with it. So leaders need to do all in their power to mitigate such unfair treatment. Calling it Corona Virus or COVID 19 clearly identifies what is being described, and that is all thatтАЩs needed. We all understand it. Some of our dearest friends are Chinese and Japanese Americans. Plus, we have dear friends who are Asian who are not Americans; they are students in university here in the States. All our Asian friends, whether born here or not, are experiencing painful prejudice and spewed venom over this virus. The virus is the enemy, and not people of a particular descent. We grieve for them and have tried to do all in our power to support them, if from a distance now. I canтАЩt thank you enough for publishing this brave and vulnerable piece. It is a big step in the right direction, making others aware (if they have not been) of what you have suffered and are suffering. My deepest prayer is that all Americans, especially Christian Americans, would fight the virus and not each other and not others different from them. We fight through prayer and through precaution. When we are prudent in words and actions concerning COVID 19, we love our neighbors as ourselves. This is what Jesus desires and commands. Thank you again for sharing from your heart. May God protect you from this flu disease and from the disease of prejudice. In Him, Lynn Morrissey Grace P. Cho says April 6, 2020 at 12:51 am Thank you, Lynn! Schuhow Debi says March 30, 2020 at 11:21 am My heart breaks for everyone who is treated like a modern day leper in these days.

I have Asian-American friends and I worry for them in this respect. I will be sharing this. Thank you, Grace. May God be with you and your family. May God heal our hearts. May He heal the world of this disease, according to His will. KAREN THOMPSON says March 30, 2020 at 12:04 pm I feel for you and although I cannot help or do anything about what you are experiencing. It is obvious that the presidentтАЩs attitude to any race is one of ignorance and is not helping the whole thing. The irony is that America greatness which he seem so pleased to keep on saying was built by different races and his own mother went there from Scotland. So had circumstances been different and his mother had chosen another way to change her life, he would not be where he is, and seems to not realise or in any way seem grateful for that fact. I hope that you can find some peace about the situation and I will be praying in the coming days. Grace P. Cho says April 6, 2020 at 12:52 am Thank you, Karen! Becky Keife says March 30, 2020 at 12:18 pm Grace, IтАЩm so grateful for you, friend.

And itтАЩs hard to ignore. I know Jesus was rejected many times. Guess itтАЩs in these moments we just have to have ask God for His strength and love. But donтАЩt give up, donтАЩt give in.

It is the unreasonable characteristic of our humanity that has witnessed centuries of rejection, oppression, and subjugation. But, God. Your discomfort, a word I am not using lightly, is real and disheartening, especially when this pandemic spares no ethnicity or class. But, God. Your tears fell because you grieved the hope and love of the community and nation in which you were born. But, God. You were made in GodтАЩs image; you were fearfully and wonderfully made. You, Grace, are the light that sits upon a hill. I applaud you for speaking your truth. I am honored to call you my Sister-in-Christ, although we have never met. I pray the peace that surpasses all understanding ushers you through this season with a head held high, propped up by your unwavering hope and faith in Jesus Christ. Be well. Grace P.

It makes me sick to my stomach to know this is happening, and I apologize for all of it. Sharing this must have been really hard as each word you wrote ushered darkness into the light.

1478,Trump calls to protect Asian Americans after virus uproar,"US President Donald Trump called Monday for protection of Asian Americans after charges that his use of the term ""Chinese virus"" had aggravated a backlash. ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!"" His tone -- and avoidance of calling SARS-CoV-2 the ""Chinese virus"" -- contrasts with last week when he voiced anger at being accused of racism. Asian American activists have reported a spike in bias incidents since the epidemic erupted, including a woman who was followed and beaten on the New York subway. Trump has called ""Chinese virus"" an ""accurate"" term because the pandemic, which has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide, was first detected in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. The World Health Organization discourages such terminology, saying it can stigmatize communities and falsely indicate to others that they cannot be infected. A woman from China who is on trial for giving false information about her whereabouts early last year after her husband was diagnosed with COVID-19 said that the communication between herself and a contact tracer had been poor. A woman accused of forcing her foreign domestic helper to strip and shower in front of her was found guilty of six charges of abusing the Indonesian on Thursday (8 July).

1503,Trump says spread of coronavirus not the fault of the Asian American community,"Sections Extras Watch Now President Donald Trump said Monday that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US is not the fault of Asian-Americans, a group that has been the target of a growing number of racist and xenophobic attacks related to the virus. тАЬIt is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,тАЭ Trump tweeted Monday evening. тАЬThey are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus (тАж) is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form.

1559,University of Texas dean connects phrase ├втВм╦ЬChinese virus├втВмтДв with harassment of Asian American students | The College Fix,"The phrase тАШfuels acts of hate that have no place in our universityтАЩ If you use the phase тАЬChinese virusтАЭ as shorthand to describe the novel coronavirus that creates the illness COVID-19, you are тАЬfuel[ing] acts of hate that have no place in our university, our community, or our country.тАЭ ThatтАЩs what the dean of the University of Texas College of Liberal Arts told her community in a Friday email forwarded to The College Fix. Ann Huff Stevens even connected the phrase, which refers to the geographic origin of SARS-CoV-2, to тАЬseveral reports of harassmentтАЭ the college has received. A spokesperson for the college denied that Stevens was ordering the community not to use the phrase after The College Fix noted that a free speech group had rebuked the University of California System about a similarly worded warning to its community, saying it violates the First Amendment. Stevens began her email: In recent days my colleagues and I have received several reports of harassment directed at Asian American graduate students as well as students from abroad who are seeking advanced degrees from the university. At a time when Americans need to come together to face a serious pandemic, the COVID-19 outbreak has instead sparked anti-Asian xenophobia both here in Texas and across the U.S. Using language that encourages others to view a crisis in overly simplistic geographic or racial terms тАФ for example, referring to COVID-19 as a тАЬChinese virusтАЭ тАФ fuels acts of hate that have no place in our university, our community, or our country. She implies that using the phrase тАЬChinese virusтАЭ or other negative references to the Chinese government, which initially arrested people for discussing the virus, is a punishable offense at UT: I urge everyone in the UT community to call out and strongly oppose words and deeds that are fueled by ignorance and hate. And for those of us who work and learn at UT, please remember that harassment of any kind should be reported immediately to appropriate university authorities.┬а MORE: FIRE warns U. California that it canтАЩt legally ban phrase тАШChinese virusтАЩ The Fix asked Stevens on Sunday to specify the exact wording or behavior behind the тАЬseveral reports of harassmentтАЭ she mentioned, and to clarify that she did not mean using the phrase тАЬChinese virusтАЭ toward a student of Asian origin constituted harassment. David Ochsner, director of the Office of Public Affairs in the College of Liberal Arts, refused to provide the details of the reported harassment, citing тАЬthe interest of protecting both the safety and the identity of those students.тАЭ The Fix did not ask for any identifying information about victims of alleged harassment. Asked how StevensтАЩ email to the community did not have the same problem as the University of CaliforniaтАЩs directive, which the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education said тАЬappear[s] to ban speech outright,тАЭ Ochsner wrote in an email: The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education acknowledges the right of government actors, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, to advise people on the public health reasons for not associating a disease with a country or origin. The CDC specifically warns against creating тАЬsocial stigma тАж towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantineтАЭ for COVID-19. FIRE also upholds expressive rights to use a phrase like тАЬChinese virus,тАЭ a principle Dean Stevens agrees with, even though she finds the phrase offensive and counterproductive. She did not instruct anyone to avoid using the phrase, but did exercise her own expressive rights to suggest that using such phrases have consequences, whether they lead to harassment or hinder efforts for people to come together to confront challenges associated with the pandemic. The Fix has asked Ochsner in a followup Sunday night how StevensтАЩ language can be squared with his novel interpretation of her email, which urges members of the community to тАЬcall outтАЭ those who use тАЬChinese virusтАЭ and implies that the phrase constitutes harassment that they should report.

1576,AAPI communities will be among the hardest to count for US Census,"Views From the Edge By Ed Diokno The US Census recognizes that the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities will be hard to count because of language difficulties and the large number of first-generation immigrants, estimated to be at least two-thirds of the over 22 million AAPI in the US. The Census is being conducted this spring and summer in accordance with a constitutional mandate that a headcount take place in the country every ten years. People will receive notice in the mail to respond to the tally online starting today to April 1. Those with no online access will be visited by a Census worker beginning in April. Due to immigration, the AAPI population is the fastest growing demographic in the US. The Census BureauтАЩs research has also shown that Asian Americans are the racial group least familiar with and most reluctant to participate in the Census. In some Asian countries, the concept of a census is foreign. Immigrants from other countries might have a distrust in big government.Suspicion of government misuse of information gathered by the Census arose in last weekтАЩs briefing aimed at the smaller communities of Asian immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Bhutanese American Robin Gurung, of Asian Refugees United, said the Nepalese government used census information in the late 1980s to deport people of Bhutanese origin. тАЬSo in the United States, thereтАЩs still a lot of worry and questions about the census тАУ like what are the benefits, and what do we need to be careful about?тАЭ тАЬWhen they hear the word тАШcensus,тАЩ itтАЩs like a nightmare,тАЭ agreed Ganesh Subedi of the Bhutanese Community Association of California. He claimed that the fear of government caused a severe undercount of the Bhutanese community in the 2010 census. Similar stories were shared by speakers representing Mongolian Americans and people from Myanmar. Meanwhile, even though Hmong Americans represent the seventh largest subgroup of Asian Americans, a nationwide count is something unfamiliar to many. тАЬPeople my age had never heard about the census before,тАЭ said Tammy Vang, a community organizer for Hmong Innovating Politics in Fresno. Despite the suspicions the Census has to overcome in order to count AAPI subgroups, the consensus of those at the briefing agreed with Gurung, who said, тАЬWe have to make ourselves visible. ThereтАЩs nobody (else) out there who will.тАЭ тАЬMore immigrants come to the United States from Asia than from anywhere else,тАЭ said Hong Mei Pang of Chinese for Affirmative Action, which cohosted the briefing along with Ethnic Media Services. тАЬBut the Asian American community is not monolithic, and without an accurate count, these newer waves of Asian immigrants will be invisible.тАЭ The majority of AAPI people are first-generation immigrants. Many arrive in the US with limited English skills. AAPI Data estimates that just under one-third of Asian immigrants arrived in the United States within the last 10 years, and thus have little or no prior experience with the census. While the online census forms are offered in five Asian languages, and the Census Bureau is publishing informational guides in about two dozen Asian languages, activists say they are concerned that the bureau has slashed the number of Asian languages in which it will advertise. If you need assistance, there are several ways that you can contact the U.S. Census Bureau. For language support: The 2020 Census can be completed by phone in the following languages. Phone lines are open every day from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. Eastern Time. For information on services for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, call the TDD number at 800-467-2020.

1700,How to Talk to Kids about Anti-Asian Racism ├втВмтАЭ Asian American Christian Collaborative (AACC),"By Dorina Lazo Gilmore-Young My 8-year-old arrived home from school in tears. Lip quivering, she came to me with a heap of questions about the coronavirus. тАЬIs my daddy going to get coronavirus because heтАЩs Chinese?тАЭ I looked at her dumbfounded тАУ my heart walking a thread-bare tight rope between sadness and anger. тАЬWho told you that, baby?тАЭ тАЬOh, kids at school are saying all different things. One kid was running around at recess saying he had the coronavirus.тАЭ I prayed. Oh Jesus, give me the words. I took my blond baby-girl into my lap, and looked into her almond-shaped, dark eyes. тАЬWhat are your questions?тАЭ We worked through them one by one. I held her close. I tried to be honest, but also reassure her with the truth of how disease spreads and how we could be cautious with washing our hands and staying out of big crowds. We talked about the most vulnerable in our circles. We took deep breaths together. She was also confused about how the virus spreads and why people were associating it with Asian Americans like us who had never even been to China. Frankly, the news on this pandemic and how it impacts us and our neighbors has changed daily. My kids have lots of questions. Misinformation swirls around us. As an Asian American family and as Christians, we canтАЩt ignore the racism that is spreading across the world faster than this virus. We donтАЩt always have answers, but itтАЩs important to talk to my kids and navigate it together. We donтАЩt have the privilege of keeping quiet on this one. As moms and dads, itтАЩs vital that we collect the facts and filter it through our spiritual lenses. ThatтАЩs the best way to help our kids navigate the chaos of this world with a deeper perspective of Kingdom living and an eternal hope.┬а 1. Identify racist comments and acts. As parents, we must open the door for communication with our kids and create a safe space for them to share. Ask kids if something they experienced or witnessed was difficult and why. Was a person singled out because of the color of their skin, the way they looked, or their cultural heritage? Take time to talk about it. 2. Lament and comfort. We need to give ourselves permission to feel deep sorrow over this spreading racism in our country. Like David in the Bible and many of the prophets, parents can lead by crying out to God with their children against the injustices in our world. We need to make space for our children to grieve and cry if they need. Then offer them comfort. 3. Pray and breathe. We can lead our kids by praying with them against racism. We can pray for Asian American brothers and sisters who have endured insults, abuse, and accusations during this time of COVID-19. We can pray against a spirit of fear. We can ask God to give us power, love, and sound minds as we respond and forgive those who have offended us. 4. Educate. Although they are well-acquainted with racism, I had to teach my daughters about xenophobia, which is a fear of someone perceived to be foreign. Right now, many Asian Americans are being blamed for spreading COVID-19. Help kids understand we are all created in GodтАЩs image. Each one is precious to God and should not accept abuse from others. Whether subtle or overt, we need to call out racism and teach our kids to do the same. 5. Love your neighbor. Now, more than ever, we have the opportunity to live out the second greatest commandment тАЬlove your neighbor as yourselfтАЭ (Matthew 22:39). This may mean sharing food and toilet paper with neighbors. This might look like helping our kids stick up for their friends who are singled out because of their ethnic background. LetтАЩs do what is counterintuitive in the face of fear. LetтАЩs lean in emotionally. We can lead our kids to speak with words of compassion and share acts of kindness with our neighbors. 6. Celebrate your culture. Parents can help rewrite the narrative of racism by helping kids celebrate their cultural background and ethnicity. Read books together about kids from Asian American heritage. Watch movies or shows that feature Asian American characters in a positive light. Make a meal together that showcases some of your cultureтАЩs favorite flavors. Talk together about the strengths and values of your culture.

1794,Asian American and Pacific Islander Leaders and Over 260 Civil Rights Organizations Call on Congress to Denounce Anti-Asian Racism around COVID-19,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: [email protected] Washington, DCтАФ As cases of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) continue to rise in the U.S., so too do incidents of anti-Asian racism towards Asian American families and businesses. As of March 10, there have been more than 110,000 cases worldwide, 1000 of which are in the U.S. NCAPA, along with over 260 organizations, sent a letter to House and Senate leadership to call for unity and publicly denounce the racist and xenophobic attacks on Asian Americans. A link to the letter can be found here: The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA) issued the following statement: тАЬWhile we recognize and are grateful for the leadership of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and others in Congress to relieve the fear and anxiety the coronavirus has created for all Americans, it has become clear that Congressional leadership should follow their example and do more. Our country needs unified, visible and strong leadership to address the growing hostile rhetoric against the Asian American community. This letter is a call to action from the civil rights community to hold Congress accountable and help bring our country together, while not letting fear and misinformation divide us. We urge House and Senate leadership to lead by example, and resist stoking fear and xenophobia, while taking tangible steps to demonstrate that our countryтАЩs leaders are committed to standing against racism.тАЭ Jeffrey Caballero, Executive Director of the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations: тАЬWhile the rise of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the United States is a legitimate and pressing public health concern, we urge health care providers and all individuals sharing information about the disease to combat misinformation and discrimination that put patients and broader communities at risk. We urge common sense, such as following practical safeguards as recommended by the CDC and your local and state public health departments. This is a global emergency that should be met with both urgency and also cultural awareness that COVID-19 is not isolated to a single ethnic population. Xenophobic attacks and discrimination towards Asian American communities are unacceptable and will not make our families safer or healthier.тАЭ Kathy Ko Chin, President and CEO, Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum: тАЬAs a country, we need to be vigilant in heeding the guidance of our public health officials and make sure that information is available in as many languages as possible so all our communities are equally well informed. We must come together during this uncertain time, care for our neighbors and exercise common sense. LetтАЩs be clear, viruses donтАЩt discriminate - and fear, ignorance and racism will not make our communities safer.тАЭ John C. Yang, President and Executive Director, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC: тАЬThe discriminatory sentiment and instances of violent attacks aimed at Asian Americans is unacceptable, but unfortunately nothing new. We thank CAPAC for their response and urge other elected officials and the media to dispel misinformation around COVID-19. We encourage allies to take action by reiterating the correct information on the virus, holding bystander intervention trainings, and by reporting hate incidents to StandAgainstHatred.org. Together, we must combat xenophobia.тАЭ Alvina Yeh, Executive Director of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, AFL-CIO: ""Over 2 million AAPIs work in healthcare, transportation and service industries--these workers are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak and yet they are facing xenophobic and racial discrimination in the workplace in addition to increased exposure to communicable diseases. Our nation's public health plan must prioritize protecting these workers and that includes guaranteeing paid sick leave and adequate health insurance coverage. It's imperative that we take care of the workers who are taking care of our communities."" ### Based in Washington, D.C., the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans is a coalition of 35 national Asian Pacific American organizations that serves to represent the interests of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities and to provide a national voice for our communitiesтАЩ concerns.

The case count includes 42 health care workers and roughly half of the cases are among 18- to 49-year-olds. The 3,006 positive cases are out of more than 20,000 test results that have been received back from labs. 57,400 additional tests are pending. Minyvonne Burke Airbnb announced a global initiative that will allow hosts to open up their homes to healthcare workers, first responders and others on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. By Thursday afternoon, the same day the company announced the initiative, 12,000 hosts had agreed to offer their homes, CEO Brian Chesky tweeted. The company said the goal is to give 100,000 responders around the world a safe and clean place to stay and Airbnb will waive all fees for stays arranged through the initiative. The initiative builds on two pilot programs already in place in Italy and France which offers free accommodations to doctors, nurses and other responders helping in the fight against the coronavirus. Airbnb hosts who participate have to abide by ""new cleanliness protocols based on recommendations from medical experts,"" Airbnb said. Update: 12,000 hosts have now opened up their homes to COVID-19 responders. Thank you, hosts.

1873,One Size Does Not Fit All: Marked Heterogeneity in Incidence of and Survival from Gastric Cancer among Asian American Subgroups,"Advanced Search Advanced Search Background: Asian Americans are at higher risk for noncardia gastric cancers (NCGC) relative to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Asian Americans are genetically, linguistically, and culturally heterogeneous, yet have mostly been treated as a single population in prior studies. This aggregation may obscure important subgroup-specific cancer patterns. Methods: We utilized data from 13 regional United States cancer registries from 1990 to 2014 to determine secular trends in incidence and survivorship from NCGC. Data were analyzed for NHWs and the six largest Asian American subgroups: Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, and South Asian (Indian/Pakistani). Results: There exists substantial heterogeneity in NCGC incidence between Asian subgroups, with Koreans (48.6 per 100,000 person-years) having seven-fold higher age-adjusted incidence than South Asians (7.4 per 100,000 person-years). Asians had generally earlier stages of diagnosis and higher rates of surgical resection compared with NHWs. All Asian subgroups also demonstrated higher 5-year observed survival compared with NHWs, with Koreans (41.3%) and South Asians (42.8%) having survival double that of NHWs (20.1%, P < 0.001). In multivariable regression, differences in stage of diagnosis and rates of resection partially explained the difference in survivorship between Asian subgroups. Conclusions: We find substantial differences in incidence, staging, histology, treatment, and survivorship from NCGC between Asian subgroups, data which challenge our traditional perceptions about gastric cancer in Asians. Both biological heterogeneity and cultural/environmental differences may underlie these findings. Impact: These data are relevant to the national discourse regarding the appropriate role of gastric cancer screening, and identifies high-risk racial/ethnic subgroups who many benefit from customized risk attenuation programs. This article is featured in Highlights of This Issue, p. 887 In the United States, Asian Americans (AA) are the fastest growing minority group. In 2017, an estimated 22 million Americans were of Asian descent (1), and the AA population is expected to double by 2050 (2). The AA population is ethnically and linguistically heterogeneous, with 84% belonging to one of the seven largest subgroups: Asian Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Pakistanis, and Vietnamese (3). Aggregation of AAs into a single population may mask substantial differences in disease epidemiology and outcomes. It has previously been shown that AA subgroups have marked differences in mortality from coronary heart disease (4), stroke (5), and multiple cancers (6, 7). A better understanding of race-specific disease risk may allow for targeted diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, a tenant of precision medicine. Gastric cancer remains the fifth most common cancer diagnosis and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (8). There is marked heterogeneity in incidence of gastric cancer worldwide, with highest incidence in East Asia, Latin America, parts of Eastern Europe, and Africa. Within the United States, there is a much higher burden of gastric cancer among AAs relative to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW; ref. 9). Few studies, however, have analyzed both differences in incidence of and survival from gastric cancer between AA subgroups within the United States (10). As there are no recommendations for gastric cancer screening from any U.S. professional society, regulatory body, or task force, a better understanding of risk by racial groups may inform future policy decisions. In this descriptive study utilizing a dataset containing granular racial subgroup information, we compare patterns of incidence and survivorship between disaggregated AA subgroups. We specifically restricted our analysis to noncardia gastric cancers (NCGC), as these cancers constitute the majority of gastric cancers and are believed to have a pathogenesis, natural history, and epidemiology distinct from cardia-type gastric cancers (11тАУ13). Given the tremendous growth of the AA population, the addition of recent immigrants from high-incidence regions, and improved modalities for the diagnosis and management of digestive cancers, we analyzed data over a 25-year period (1990тАУ2014) to determine if secular trends existed. This study was designed as a descriptive study of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) Detailed Asian/Pacific Islander subgroup incidence and population datasets (14). A data-use agreement was signed by all study team members who had direct access to the data. Incidence data during the 25-year period between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2014, were obtained from 13 U.S. regional SEER cancer registries, which record detailed subgroup populations (California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Atlanta, Detroit, and Seattle). Collectively, these registries account for over 54% of the AA population (15). Population data were derived from the SEER detailed population databases, a specialized AA population file derived from the U.S. Census (16). For decennial census years (1990, 2000, 2010), AA population estimates were derived from the U.S. Census; for intercensus years (1991тАУ1999, 2001тАУ2009, 2011тАУ2014), estimates were derived by linear interpolation or extrapolation of U.S. Census estimates (15). SEER submissions are checked for quality and completeness prior to release for public use (17). Linkage of incident cases with county of diagnosis were performed utilizing the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code. County FIPS codes were then linked to county-level attributes derived from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey file for the year 2010 (1). Estimates for the percentage of families whose income is below the Federal poverty limit as based on Department of Health and Human Services criteria (County Poverty), and the percentage of persons 16 years and older who are unemployed (County Unemployment) were recorded for each county (1). Analysis was restricted to the six largest (by population) AA subgroups which are reported on the U.S. Census: Chinese (2010 U.S. Census population 3,137,061), Indian or Pakistani (3,207,090), Filipino (2,555,923), Vietnamese (1,548,499), Korean (1,423,784), and Japanese (763,325; ref. 18). Notably, for incidence and survival analysis, Indians or Pakistanis (South Asians) were aggregated as they were not disaggregated in the incidence datasets until January 1, 2010. NHWs (2010 U.S. Census population 202,229,636) served as the reference population. AAs were included in this analysis regardless of Hispanic ethnicity. Cases of NCGC were identified based upon International Classification of Disease for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3) anatomic location codes (C16.1тАУC16.9). From these cases, only tumors with a histology consistent with adenocarcinoma (ICD-O-3 histology codes 801x, 802x, 814x, 821x, 822x, 823x, 825x, 826x, 831x, 848x, 849x) were included. The anatomic location of each NCGC was recorded (antrum, body, fundus, or unspecified). Diffuse-type NCGCs are believed to have a natural history and epidemiology distinct from other NCGCs, and feature early submucosal invasion and diffusion (тАЬLinitis plasticaтАЭ), and signet ring cells on histology. Tumors with histology codes 8142 (тАЬLinitis plasticтАЭ), 8145 (carcinoma, diffuse-type type), and 8490 (signet ring cell carcinoma) were coded as diffuse-type NCGCs; all other tumors were non-diffuse-type NCGCs. Cases diagnosed in patients <30 years of age were excluded. Additional demographic covariates captured from the data sets included age at time of diagnosis, sex, year of diagnosis, and county of diagnosis. Tumor-level data captured included tumor histology, NCI-derived summary stage (localized, regional, distant, or unknown; ref. 19), and performance of surgical resection of the primary tumor (surgery codes 30, 31, 32, 33, 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, 60, 61, 62, 63, 80). Health insurance coverage was available from 2007 onward, and was classified as insured with Medicaid, insured with non-Medicaid insurance, uninsured, or unknown. As cancer diagnosis, management, and survival has evolved over the study period, the time period of diagnosis was stratified (1990тАУ2000 or 2001тАУ2014) and utilized for adjustment. Age-adjusted incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NCGC in each AA subgroup and NHWs were expressed as cases per 100,000 persons, and age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population using SEER*Stat software (16). Rates were suppressed for case counts <10. Differences in rates between groups were assessed using RRs assuming a Poisson distribution. Annual percentage change (APC) with two-sided P values were used to characterize the magnitude and direction of trends (20, 21). Joinpoint regression is a Monte Carlo permutation-based method used to identify significant changes in the trend of cancer incidence rates over time (21). Joinpoint regression was performed for each AA subgroup on age-standardized incidence rates over time to identify inflection points, using a prespecified significance level of P = 0.05 with an uncorrelated errors model utilizing the Joinpoint Regression Program (22). Differences in patient and tumor attributes between AA subgroups were analyzed using Student t test for normally distributed variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for nonnormally distributed variables, and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. Cause of death and survival time in months were captured for each patient in the cohort. The primary endpoint was observed, all-cause survival at 5 years. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression was performed to evaluate the association between AA subgroup and NCGC-specific survival. The proportional hazards assumption was tested by assessing the log(тИТlog) plot of the survival function. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and county-level attributes were analyzed as potential confounders. Interactions between covariates was assessed by including an interaction term in the multivariable model. For the purposes of hazards regression, all variables were considered time-independent. A priori sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the hazards regression. To control for differences in noncancer mortality between racial groups, sensitivity analysis was performed restricting the endpoint to cancer-specific deaths. Some recent AA immigrants may choose to return to their country of origin following a cancer diagnosis, as shown by Pinheiro and colleagues (23). Therefore, sensitivity analysis was conducted by considering any censoring event within 12 months of cancer diagnosis as a mortality event. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed restricting analysis to patients diagnosed at a local cancer stage, restricting analysis to patients with known tumor stage and histology, and restricting to patients with known insurance status (available for years 2007тАУ2014 only). All models estimated the HR and CI, with two-sided P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. There was a small degree of missing data for categorical covariates (<5% for all covariates); these observations were excluded from analysis in the hazards regression model. Incidence and APC were analyzed using SEER*Stat software (16). Survival analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.). Age-adjusted incidence of NCGC over the study period, stratified by sex and years of diagnosis (1990тАУ2000 vs. 2001тАУ2014) are depicted in Table 1. Among males, all AA racial subgroups with the exception of South Asians demonstrated higher age-adjusted incidence in both 1990тАУ2000 and 2001тАУ2014 periods compared with NHWs (rate ratio P < 0.001 for all racial subgroups except South Asians). Koreans demonstrated the highest incidence among males in both 1990тАУ2000 and 2001тАУ2014, with age-adjusted incidence roughly 8-fold higher than South Asians. Age-adjusted incidence of NCBC by race. Similar patterns were found among females, where all AA racial subgroups with the exception of South Asians demonstrated higher age-adjusted incidence in both 1990тАУ2000 and 2001тАУ2014 periods compared with NHWs (rate ratio P < 0.001 for all racial subgroups except South Asians). Koreans also demonstrated the highest incidence among females in both 1990тАУ2000 and 2001тАУ2014, with age-adjusted incidence nearly 6-fold higher than South Asians. Age-adjusted incidence of NCGC by racial group over the study period, stratified by sex, is depicted in Fig. 1. Among males, all racial groups demonstrated decreasing incidence of NCGC over the study period: NHW APC тИТ3.8% (CI: тИТ4.0% to тИТ3.7%), Chinese APC тИТ2.3% (CI: тИТ2.9% to тИТ1.8%), Japanese APC тИТ4.2% (CI тИТ4.9% to тИТ3.6%), Filipino APC тИТ3.1% (CI: тИТ4.2% to тИТ2.0%), Korean APC тИТ2.9% (CI: тИТ3.8% to тИТ2.1%), and Vietnamese APC тИТ4.3% (CI: тИТ5.4% to тИТ3.2%). Similarly, among females, all racial groups demonstrated decreasing incidence of NCGC over the study period: NHW APC тИТ2.9% (CI: тИТ3.2% to тИТ2.6%), Chinese APC тИТ2.3% (CI: тИТ3.0% to тИТ1.6%), Japanese APC тИТ4.2% (CI: тИТ4.9% to тИТ3.3%), Filipino APC тИТ3.0% (CI: тИТ4.1% to тИТ1.9%), Korean APC тИТ2.5% (CI: тИТ3.5% to тИТ1.4%), and Vietnamese APC тИТ3.5% (CI: тИТ5.0% to тИТ1.9%). South Asian APC could not be calculated due to small sample sizes. No joinpoints were identified for any racial group in either sex. Age-adjusted (to year 2000 U.S. Census) incidence of NCGCs per 100,000 person-years, as stratified by racial subgroup over the study period (1990тАУ2014). Data presented with logarithmic Y-axis. Left panel depicts data for males, and right panel for females. Data for South Asians not depicted due to small sample sizes. Patient demographic characteristics by racial subgroup are depicted in Table 2. AAs in aggregate constituted a higher proportion of the 2001тАУ2014 cohort compared with the 1990тАУ2000 cohort, consistent with the growth of the U.S. AA population over the study period. There were differences in age at diagnosis between subgroups, with NHWs having the oldest age at diagnosis, followed by Japanese; South Asians, Vietnamese, and Korean patients tended to have younger ages of diagnosis (P < 0.001). There were small differences in sex distribution between groups, although in all groups males outnumbered females. There were differences in county-level measures of poverty and unemployment between subgroups. Japanese in particular tended to live in counties of low poverty and low unemployment. There were also differences in insurance status between subgroups; Japanese tended to have high rates of non-Medicaid insurance. Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, Vietnamese, and South Asians had higher levels of Medicaid-insurance or non-insurance relative to NHWs (P < 0.001). Patient demographic characteristics by race. NCGC characteristics and observed 5-year survival by subgroup are depicted in Table 3. There existed notable differences in stage of diagnosis between racial groups. In particular, Koreans (31.4%) and South Asians (29.2%) had significantly higher rates of diagnosis at local stage compared with NHWs (21.8%) and Filipinos (18.2%, P < 0.001). With regards to histology, all AA subgroups had a higher proportion of diffuse-type cancers compared with NHWs (P < 0.001), with Filipinos (33.5%) and Vietnamese (31.1%) having the highest proportion of diffuse-type cancers. There were notable differences in the anatomic location of cancers, with all AA subgroups having a higher frequency of cancers originating from the antrum compared to NHWs (P < 0.001). In particular, Vietnamese (45.6%), Koreans (42.0%), and Chinese (41.4%) had a very high percentage of antral cancers. There existed substantial differences in rates of surgical resection, with all AA subgroups undergoing surgical resection at higher rates compared with NHWs (P < 0.001). In particular, Koreans (54.3%) and Vietnamese (50.0%) had very high rates of surgical resection relative to other subgroups. With regards to observed 5-year survival, all AA subgroups had higher survival compared with NHWs (P < 0.001). In particular, Koreans (41.3%) and South Asians (42.8%) had survival over double that of NHWs (20.1%). NCGC characteristics by race. Cancer characteristics and survival were further stratified by sex (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) and period of diagnosis (1990тАУ2000, 2001тАУ2014; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). In all stratified analyses, the trends of AAs having earlier stage of diagnosis compared with NHWs, a higher proportion of cancers originating from the antrum compared to NHWs, a higher rate of surgical resection compared with NHWs, and better overall survival compared with NHWs was preserved. To understand potential confounders of differences in survival, Cox regression was performed (Table 4). In the minimally-adjusted model (adjusted for age, sex, and time period of diagnosis), all AA subgroups demonstrated significantly better survival compared with NHWs. Following adjustment for stage of diagnosis, this survival advantage over NHWs slightly attenuated but remained significant for all AA subgroups (P < 0.001, for all subgroups). Following additional adjustment for performance of surgical resection and tumor histology, the HRs further attenuated but remained significant for all AA subgroups (P < 0.001, for all subgroups). Following further adjustment for regional socioeconomic attributes, the HRs remained significant for all subgroups. HRs and 95% CIs of overall survival by racial group. To assess model sensitivity toward differences in noncancer mortality between races, sensitivity analysis was performed by restricting outcomes to cancer-specific deaths and treating noncancer deaths as points of censorship. Although the HR slightly attenuated for all AA subgroups, they remained significant in both minimally- and fully-adjusted models. To evaluate model sensitivity toward insurance status, sensitivity analysis was performed, restricted to years 2007тАУ2014 where insurance data was available (Supplementary Table S5); in this model, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and South Asian race continued to associate inversely with hazard in the minimally-adjusted model. The HR of Japanese race attenuated significantly in the fully-adjusted model, whereas the HRs for Chinese, Korean, and South Asian race remained significant. To evaluate model sensitivity toward emigration of AAs following cancer diagnosis, all censored observations within 12 months of diagnosis among AAs were counted as deaths. There was no significant change in HR for any AA subgroup in either minimally- or fully-adjusted model in this analysis. Sensitivity analysis was also performed by restricting analysis to cases with known tumor location and cancer stage (Supplementary Table S6); in this analysis, the survival advantage of all groups except Filipinos persisted in both minimally- and fully-adjusted models. In this descriptive study capturing 25 years of longitudinal data from 13 U.S. regional SEER cancer registries which collectively represent over half of the AA population, we found substantial differences in incidence of and survival from NCGC between AA subgroups. Far from being a homogeneous group, we found that cancer incidence varied nearly eight-fold between Asian subgroups. We further found that Asian subgroups demonstrate unique patterns with regards to stage of diagnosis, rates of resection, and socioeconomic profile. We demonstrate that even after adjustment for patient characteristics, tumor staging, treatment, and socioeconomic factors, AA subgroups continue to demonstrate both better overall and cancer-specific survival compared with NHWs. These findings are novel, timely, and may help to direct future risk attenuation and educational efforts to reduce cancer mortality in the United States. Although NCGC incidence has declined over the study period, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese American populations remain at heightened risk. As screening for gastric cancer is not routinely performed in the United States, diagnosis is usually made upon symptom onset. This is especially tragic as gastric cancers are curable (through surgical or endoscopic resection) if diagnosed early. These disaggregated data may hold implications for cancer screening, as while mass screening of the general American population is not cost effective, targeted screening of high-risk ethnic and racial minorities may be (24). This study provides granular incidence data, which may guide future cost-effectiveness studies focused on the highest-risk subgroups within the multiethnic U.S. population. The relative survival advantage of Asians relative to NHWs is stark and in contrast to usual patterns of cancer inequality and disparity among minority groups (25тАУ27). Some of these differences may be secular in nature, such as the increasing proportion of AAs in the 2001тАУ2014 cohort (where survival was higher) due to the rapid growth of the AA population. Part of the survival gap may also be explained by differences in stage of diagnosis and rates of surgical resection. Notably, there appeared to be a strong correlation between rates of survival and rates of surgical resection, and the groups with highest rates of surgery (Koreans, Vietnamese, Chinese) also had the best overall survival. This is particularly interesting as early-stage gastric cancer is mostly asymptomatic and detected incidentally. Our previous work analyzing a multicenter database showed that 90% of gastric cancers in the United States are diagnosed during endoscopies for symptoms (such as anemia, weight loss, or bleeding), at which time disease has often progressed beyond a localized stage (28). In contrast to the United States, South Korea, Japan, and certain regions of China have implemented population-level mass screening programs for gastric cancer (29, 30). We hypothesize that some of the differences in early detection between AA subgroups reflect an increased cultural awareness of risk for NCGC among first- or second-generation immigrants from high-incidence regions with established screening programs. These patients may be more likely to request referral for surveillance from their primary care physicians, especially as knowledge of gastric cancer risk is low among the majority of American primary care providers (31). Even after adjustment for differences in stage of diagnosis, therapy received, tumor characteristics, and demographic attributes, a distinct survival advantage existed for AAs compared to NHWs. This тАЬsurvival gapтАЭ has been described comparing Asian-based and Western cohorts (32тАУ34), as well as comparing Asians and NHWs within Western nations (10, 35, 36). This finding may suggest underlying differences in tumor behavior between racial groups, such as differences in somatic genetic alterations (37, 38). With comprehensive molecular characterization of NCGCs through the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (39), additional understanding of the biological underpinnings of this racial gap may emerge. Several limitations to these data exist. Important risk factors for NCGC, such as Helicobacter pylori infection status, cigarette smoking, family history, and dietary patterns could not be captured from the SEER data sets. Although county-level attributes of poverty and unemployment were captured, patient-specific data regarding socioeconomic status (such as individual employment status, occupation, household income) could not be captured. Insurance status data was available only from 2007 and later. Immigrant generation and year of immigration could not be determined from these data sets. Emigration from the United States following diagnosis could not be captured, and there could be bias introduced by emigration which is not fully accounted for by sensitivity analysis. In summary, this descriptive study capturing data from 13 U.S. regional SEER cancer registries found striking differences between AA subgroups in incidence, staging, histology, treatment, and survivorship from NCGC. These data add to a limited body of existing literature regarding cancer risk and outcomes between Asian subpopulations, and may hold implications for targeted early detection programs.

2065,FBI warns of potential surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans amid coronavirus,"Federal law enforcement is warning of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans as the coronavirus crisis continues to grow, according to a new FBI analysis obtained by ABC News. ""The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease тАж endangering Asian American communities,"" according to the intelligence report, which was compiled by the FBIтАЩs Houston office and distributed to local law enforcement agencies across the country. ""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations."" The contagion that has left much of the nation in near-lockdown and caused thousands of deaths globally began late last year in the region of Wuhan in eastern China. Since then, many Americans, including President Donald Trump and other political leaders and media commentators, have adopted the practice of calling the ailment the ""China virus"" or some other variant that makes reference to China or Wuhan, rather than ""coronavirus"" or ""COVID-19,"" the terms used by federal health officials and in the FBI analysis. The rhetoric, critics say, has fueled ill will and has led some people to act out against Asian Americans. (MORE: Pompeo pushes 'Wuhan virus' label to counter Chinese disinformation) Trump has defended his language, explaining that itтАЩs simply a way of reminding people from where the virus emanated. He has also denied the term is racist or that the term maligns people of Asian heritage. ""It did come from China,"" Trump said at a White House briefing Tuesday. ""It is a very accurate term."" Two days later the president said, ""We have to protect our Asian Americans,"" echoing a tweet from earlier in the week in which he said the coronavirus was ""NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form."" At a White House briefing Thursday the president could not point to any specific measures he was taking to protect the Asian American community.

The suspension of Sha'Carri Richardson, the flamboyant sprinter who finished first in the 100-meter dash at the U.S. Olympic trials, over a failed drug test for marijuana has already sparked calls from advocates for a change within the international sports world. Although the 21-year-old told reporters she used marijuana during the Olympic trials in Oregon, which has legalized the substance for recreational use, as a way to cope with the loss of her birth mother, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency suspended her for 30 days citing the World Anti-Doping Agency's ban on cannabis. Marijuana legalization advocates said Richardson's case should propel the U.S. to urge international sports leaders to take a hard look at the association's rules and the reasoning behind them.

Congressional Democrats are eyeing a swift timeline for Senate approval of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan, aiming to have the legislation on the floor as early as the week of July 19, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The details of the timeline, including a push to have legislative language ready for consideration by Friday, were discussed among Democratic congressional aides and Louisa Terrell, the head of White House Legislative Affairs, and her deputy, Shuwanza Goff on a call Wednesday, the sources said. The next hurdle for the bipartisan group of more than 20 co-sponsors, led by Sens Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz, and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, would be to obtain an official analysis of their bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which crunches the numbers to see if proposed revenue would cover the desired new spending.

2134,My family's new reality under COVID-19 | Asian American Action Fund,"By Ally Mark, AAAF Fellow The fact is more obvious every day: COVID-19 will leave no family unscathed. Every single American will feel the effects of the pandemic, and the most vulnerable, as always, are, and will continue to, bear the greatest brunt of it. The family unit has been the backbone of American life, and the core of my own network; COVID-19 threatens to rock that very foundation. This is my familyтАЩs new reality under lock down. The magnitude of the crisis truly crystallized for me, in a personal way at least, when I spoke with my cousin Josh. He works as an emergency medicine resident in New Orleans and told us recently his hospital was down to 10 respirators. They would soon be forced to choose who lives and dies. For context, Louisiana is experiencing the fastest rate of new infections in the world right now, while New Orleans alone reported more cases than all but 15 states. Josh said the city is considering opening up the Super Dome for extra bed space, a move starkly reminiscent of the stadiumтАЩs famous role in sheltering residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Yes, COVID-19 is a Katrina-level of disaster. Our Gong Gong lives in another epicenter of this outbreak, Santa Clara County, California. Gong Gong celebrated his 84th birthday a week ago, which he spent self-quarantined with a pineapple upside down cake my sister baked for him. He told me he was eligible for a new coronavirus testing pilot program under Verily, a company associated with GoogleтАЩs parent company. (Yes, this one that Trump bungled the explanation on.) He decided he would only submit to testing if they didnтАЩt require him to stand in line near other people. My family lives about 15 minutesтАЩ drive away from him, and we used to eat Sunday dinner with him every week. But, as things stand currently, that birthday is likely the last time they will see him in person for some time. We will now conduct Sunday dinners over video chat. This worries my mother. Mama works in healthcare, at San Mateo CountyтАЩs flagship hospital, so she knows how much the outbreak strains local health systems. She just secured a contract extension last month, but now, she doesnтАЩt know if the hospital will be able to keep her on. One of her close coworkers reported a fever yesterday, so she has almost certainly been exposed. Still, she worries more about Gong Gong and my sister than herself. My sister Nat just began experiencing cold-like symptoms, a week after her high school ended in-person classes. According to MamaтАЩs hospital, symptoms present five to six days after infection, on average. Nat spends her days in online classes, working alongside Mama and my brother, who evacuated UCLA campus once all the finals moved online. Teachers have evidently adapted to these changes as variably as the rest of us. My sisterтАЩs English teacher requires only four days per week, and assigns some optional homework, which annoys my mother to no end. Mama thinks this teacherтАЩs methods fail to prepare Nat for sophomore year English, but who really knows how long this will continue? I know I cannot survive for months on end with the pandemic suppressing the economy this way. Because COVID-19 has disrupted business operations everywhere, I was denied a job that the company was all set to offer me. My fallback plan also fell through. The coffee shop I worked at as a barista in college drastically restricted hours and cut its largely student staff. Now, IтАЩm filing for unemployment, joining the 3.3 million other Americans suddenly adrift, all because the President refused to do his job and put his constituents first. I wrote last weekтАЩs piece because the PresidentтАЩs continued use of the racist term, тАЬChinese virus,тАЭ angered me. The President and his allies shifted the AAPI community from model minority to yellow peril with just two words. The consequences? Predictably awful for AAPIs across the country. ***Note: If you have experienced a racist incident related to the coronavirus, I encourage you to report it on this website. (My dadтАЩs college friend is one of the professors involved in this documentation project!)*** However, although we suffer from the politicized language used to talk about the virus, AAPIs experience all the same grim, isolating effects of COVID-19 as anybody else in this country. I am angry at the President and his alliesтАЩ xenophobic language, but IтАЩm most infuriated by the PresidentтАЩs continued failure to truthfully address the nation and seize responsibility for the horrific situation he helped cause. Josh, a Chinese American, risks his own health 12 hours a day, to care for this onslaught of COVID patients. He, like all doctors, swore to do no harm. But how does the President thank him for his bravery and service? By derogatorily attaching our ethnicity to the cause of this deadly disease. Not to mention depriving Josh of his beloved March Madness and NBA. Josh last step foot in China over ten years, but he is dedicating his life to saving the lives of others. Lives that, in these last few weeks, the President has utterly failed to protect.

2223,Why violence against the Asian American community is on the rise during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Anti-Asian racism is nothing new in America. The pandemic, and Trump, just made it worse. Harassment toward Asian Americans has spiked in the last year: According to Stop AAPI Hate, an organization thatтАЩs been tracking these reports, over 2,800 incidents were documented in 2020. And more recently, a wave of violent attacks against elderly people has renewed focus on this issue. These incidents тАФ which include everything from getting shunned at work to physical assaults тАФ have been wide-ranging. In February, a 27-year-old Korean American man was assaulted in Los Angeles and targeted with racial slurs. Last winter, a 16-year-old student in the San Fernando Valley was beaten so badly by his classmates that he had to go to the emergency room. And this past March, a restaurant in Yakima, Washington, was vandalized with racist language. The reports to Stop AAPI Hate describe other forms of harassment, too, such as getting spat on at a restaurant, verbally attacked at the park and denied service at different establishments. тАЬI was in line at the pharmacy when a woman approached me and sprayed Lysol all over me,тАЭ one account reads. тАЬShe was yelling out, тАШYouтАЩre the infection. Go home. We donтАЩt want you here!тАЩтАЭ Among these attacks, there are notable patterns: Women were more likely than men to say they were targeted, several assaults involved children, and harassment was more likely to occur at retail stores and pharmacies since people have been limiting their activities during the pandemic. тАЬSo many of us have experienced it, sometimes for the first time in our lives,тАЭ says Manjusha Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, a group that helped set up this tracker. тАЬIt makes it much harder to go to the grocery store, to take a walk, to be outside our homes.тАЭ This rise in anti-Asian harassment has occurred as the US continues to grapple with Covid-19, and it follows months of xenophobic rhetoric by former President Donald Trump, who frequently used racist names for the virus and associated it with Asian Americans. The broader uptick in racism, however, isnтАЩt just fueled by the pandemic. Although the uncertainty of the outbreak тАФ coupled with the former presidentтАЩs rhetoric тАФ has amplified it, this prejudice is rooted in longstanding biases toward Asian Americans that have persisted since some of the earliest immigrants came to the US generations ago. тАЬI think this surge is [driven by] the rhetoric that political leaders have been using ... but I donтАЩt think we would have seen the spike in anti-Asian bias without a pretty strong foundation rooted in the тАШforever foreignerтАЩ stereotype,тАЭ says University of Maryland Asian American studies professor Janelle Wong. How do you define your Asian identity? We want to hear from you for an upcoming story. Fill out this Google form to share your experience. The тАЬforever foreignerтАЭ idea Wong references is one thatтАЩs been used to тАЬotherтАЭ Asian Americans in the US for decades: It suggests that Asians who live in America are fundamentally foreign and canтАЩt be fully American. Enduring tropes that have associated Asian Americans with illness and the consumption of тАЬweirdтАЭ foods, which have reemerged in relation to the coronavirus, are among those that play into this concept. The revival of these stereotypes and the recent spike in harassment are having a pointed effect: TheyтАЩre forcing a reckoning about the existence of anti-Asian racism in the US.┬а Racism toward Asian Americans goes back a long time. In fact, it was enshrined into law when some of the earliest generations of Asian Americans were immigrating to the United States in the 1800s. The Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, two of the countryтАЩs first immigration laws, were designed explicitly to bar Chinese American laborers from entering the country because of widespread xenophobia and concerns about workplace competition. These laws тАФ along with others that made it impossible for immigrants to reenter the country if they visited China тАФ were among the earliest that tagged Asian American immigrants as foreigners who didnтАЩt belong in the US. тАЬWhereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof,тАЭ read the first lines of the Exclusion Act. In addition to limiting immigration, the act guaranteed that Chinese Americans could not become US citizens for decades. тАЬVery early on in the history of this country, Chinese Americans were seen as a group of people we wanted to keep out,тАЭ says Yale sociology professor Grace Kao. And immigration policy wasnтАЩt the only place where such discrimination was apparent. As illnesses, including smallpox and the bubonic plague, spread in the late 1800s, San FranciscoтАЩs Chinese residents were repeatedly used as тАЬmedical scapegoats,тАЭ according to San Francisco State public health researcher Joan Trauner. When the city grappled with a smallpox outbreak in 1875-тАЩ76, for example, officials blamed the тАЬfoul and disgusting vaporsтАЭ тАФ and тАЬunwholesomeтАЭ living conditions of Chinatown тАФ for fueling it, according to Trauner. Even after the epidemic continued following the city-ordered fumigation of all the homes in Chinatown, the blame persisted. тАЬI unhesitatingly declare my belief that the cause is the presence in our midst of 30,000 (as a class) of unscrupulous, lying and treacherous Chinamen, who have disregarded our sanitary laws, concealed, and are concealing their cases of smallpox,тАЭ city health officer J.L. Meares wrote at the time. Similarly, when the city encountered cases of the bubonic plague in 1900, one of which was detected in Chinatown, San Francisco attempted to quarantine roughly 14,000 Chinese Americans who lived in that part of the city. At one point, city officials proposed sending Chinese residents to a detention camp where they could be cordoned off from other members of the public, though a circuit court rejected this plan. In both cases, the vitriol toward Chinese Americans was driven by explicit racism, a fundamental lack of medical knowledge, and pushback toward the influx of Chinese laborers competing with white workers for job opportunities. Policy prescriptions were actively informed by assumptions that Chinatowns were a тАЬlaboratory of infection,тАЭ Trauner explains. тАЬA common trope in American popular culture was that the Chinese ate rats and lived in filthy, overcrowded quarters,тАЭ says Princeton University history professor Beth Lew-Williams. тАЬIn the 19th century, San Francisco routinely banned Chinese from public hospitals.тАЭ The recurring association of Chinese Americans with the ideas of being тАЬdirtyтАЭ or illness-ridden is inextricably tied up with xenophobia тАФ and as Nylah Burton writes for Vox, itтАЩs an association thatтАЩs been used to тАЬotherтАЭ many people of color, including Mexican Americans and African Americans. Related And now, because the origins of the coronavirus have likely been traced back to a wet market in Wuhan, China, where people purchase groceries, this information has renewed racist jokes and statements about the type of food that Asian Americans eat. ItтАЩs a sentiment thatтАЩs so common, it was a plot line of the ABC television show Fresh Off the Boat, when a young Eddie Huang, the Asian American protagonist of the show, is shunned after consuming his lunch in front of his white classmates because they see the noodles in it as тАЬgrossтАЭ and тАЬnasty.тАЭ This treatment of Asian foods is simply another plank of the othering of Asian American people: By deeming anything thatтАЩs different or unfamiliar as exotic or disgusting, the idea that Asian people are fundamentally foreign is further reinforced. While the Chinese Exclusion Act was ultimately repealed in the 1940s, the racism it embodied played a central role in shaping how the United States continues to view Asian Americans. The idea that Asian Americans are тАЬforever foreignersтАЭ helped lay the groundwork for Japanese internment during World War II, when Japanese American citizens were sent to detention camps solely on the basis of their ethnicity, due to suspicions that they were abetting the Japanese government in some way. In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Islamophobia toward Muslim Americans and prejudice toward South Asian Americans was similarly fueled by assumptions that people were not loyal to the United States because of their religion, ethnicity, and external appearance. тАЬItтАЩs always easily activated, itтАЩs very tenacious, itтАЩs very familiar to many Americans,тАЭ says Wong of this assumption. тАЬIтАЩm sixth-generation Chinese American in the US, and I still feel it.тАЭ Because the hostility that Asian Americans have faced is rooted in this question of belonging in the US, some тАФ including New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang тАФ have suggested that Asians can combat this prejudice by proving their patriotism and commitment to their community. ItтАЩs a misguided argument founded on тАЬrespectability politicsтАЭ that further puts the onus on Asian Americans to demonstrate how American they are тАФ and itтАЩs revealing of how much some people still think Asians need to compensate for looking тАЬdifferent.тАЭ Political pushback toward China, including its handling of the virus, has also been conflated with hostility toward Chinese Americans in a way that historic US tensions with Asian nations have been projected onto people of Asian descent in the past. Last year, former Washington Gov. Gary Locke тАФ who is Chinese American тАФ was featured in a Trump attack ad against President Joe Biden. Because of the way itтАЩs framed, the ad appears to imply that Locke, who once served as the US ambassador to China, is a Chinese official and not an American one. тАЬAsian Americans тАФ whether youтАЩre second-, third-, or fourth-generation, will always be viewed as foreigners,тАЭ Locke told the Atlantic. тАЬWe donтАЩt say that about second- or third-generation Irish Americans or Polish Americans. No one would even think to include them in a picture when youтАЩre talking about foreign government officials.тАЭ Although racism toward Asian Americans has persisted for generations, itтАЩs rarely explicitly confronted or talked about. тАЬAsian discrimination tends to be overlooked and widely tolerated, even among educated classes,тАЭ University of Pennsylvania English professor Josephine Park told Penn Today. There are many reasons for this, according to Asian American studies scholars. Relative to other people of color, including Black Americans and Latino Americans, Asian Americans have faced discrimination of a different degree. Related Additionally, because of the diversity within the Asian American community тАФ which includes more than 30 ethnic groups тАФ there is a breadth of experience that isnтАЩt always all the same. тАЬItтАЩs rare to see all parts of the Asian American community equally affected by an issue,тАЭ says UC Riverside political science professor and head of AAPI Data Karthick Ramakrishnan. The perpetuation of the тАЬmodel minorityтАЭ myth, which was introduced by sociologist William Petersen in a New York Times Magazine piece in 1966, further complicated the conversation about Asian Americans and racism. As part of his piece, Petersen pits minority groups against one another and argues that Japanese Americans were able to attain economic success in the face of injustice and discrimination in a way that other groups, which Petersen dubbed тАЬproblem minorities,тАЭ were not. ItтАЩs a fictitious argument thatтАЩs been used repeatedly as a тАЬwedgeтАЭ between minority groups, Kat Chow reported for NPR. By branding Asian Americans as a тАЬmodel minority,тАЭ writers like Petersen obscured how systemic injustices have disproportionately hurt Black Americans. The term, too, reduced the visibility of racism against Asian Americans as well. тАЬThe dominant cultureтАЩs belief in the тАШmodel minorityтАЩ allows it to justify ignoring the unique discrimination faced by Asian Americans,тАЭ writes Robert Chang, in his book Disoriented: Asian Americans, Law and the Nation-State. Now, a rise in harassment is sparking a new conversation about the type of prejudice that Asian Americans experience. For some, it marks one of the rare times they are confronting this problem in such an explicit way. тАЬI havenтАЩt been harassed for my race for years and years. ItтАЩs been a really long time, so it felt like it came out of nowhere,тАЭ California resident Julie Kang told VoxтАЩs Catherine Kim. Experts see these incidents compelling people to talk about discrimination toward Asian Americans more openly. тАЬI think there is a newfound understanding for a lot of folks,тАЭ says Kulkarni. тАЬWe hope this will spur more dialogue and more action, frankly.тАЭ Some also think it has the potential to improve solidarity between Asian Americans and other people of color, many of whom deal with racist harassment and violence тАФ including from the police тАФ on a regular basis. тАЬI hope that we realize that this kind of process happens to other groups all the time,тАЭ says Ramakrishnan. The response from some lawmakers has helped underscore this solidarity: A few weeks ago, a group of House Democrats representing the Black, Asian, and Hispanic caucuses unequivocally denounced anti-Asian rhetoric and violence. тАЬThe Asian American community is facing a crisis of hatred that we cannot tolerate,тАЭ said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). тАЬWe will not tolerate anti-Asian bias, we will not tolerate anti-Asian bigotry, we will not tolerate these hate crimes. All of us stand with the Asian American community until we can put this scourge to an end.тАЭ The attacks Asian Americans are facing across the country are bringing the dialogue about longstanding prejudices to the fore. And as Americans are having more frank conversations about race and institutional biases, they arenтАЩt as easy to ignore as they have been in the past. тАЬAddressing ... these kinds of dominant stereotypes that are really pervasive, that are so easily activated, requires public education and the broader public committing to understand race in America,тАЭ says Wong. тАЬThereтАЩs a way that it could be a really potent reminder that Asian Americans are racialized in the US and that we canтАЩt go it alone.тАЭ ┬а Will you support VoxтАЩs explanatory journalism? Millions rely on VoxтАЩs journalism to understand the coronavirus crisis.

2270,AsAm News | The mental health implications of COVID-19 related violence against Asian Americans,"Amid the surge in COVID-19 related violence against Asian Americans, there is increasing concern about the damaging psychological effects of discriminatory acts directed toward Asian American communities. STOP AAPI HATE, a reporting center that launched on March 19 2020 to monitor the rise in verbal and physical attacks against Asian Americans, has since received nearly 1,500 reports of coronavirus discrimination from Asian Americans. In early March, Yuming Wang, a Philadelphia lawyer and honorary chairman of the Pennsylvania United Chinese Coalition, created a WeChat group for Chinese Americans following mounting concerns over the rising number of racist incidents during the pandemic, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. In a greater effort to encourage Chinese Americans to report any racist incidents, Wang soon began to work closely with local and state police, the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, and other law enforcement agencies. тАЬChinese Americans have been increasingly worried about their safety every day, and the issue is getting deeper and deeper into their mental health concerns,тАЭ Wang said. тАЬAmong [the group members], the biggest concern is that when someone goes somewhere, [they] may be attacked, verbally or physically, because of being Asian or Chinese Americans.тАЭ Coupled with fears of contracting COVID-19, Asian Americans are facing an additional worry of encountering growing hostility and racist incidents. A recent survey conducted by the Center for Public Integrity, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, found that more than 30 percent of Americans have witnessed someone blame Asians for the COVID-19 pandemic, NBC News reports. Among the surveyтАЩs total respondents, 44 percent labeled a specific group or organization responsible and nearly two-thirds of those respondents mentioned China or Chinese people. Professor Russell Jeung, the chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University, has also compiled data on these discriminatory incidents. Jeung described these incidents as being motivated by тАЬa level of hate and a level of anger thatтАЩs very palpable, thatтАЩs pretty horrific and pretty traumatizing,тАЭ he told the San Francisco Chronicle. The number of reported hate crimes against Asian Americans has seen a decline for 15 years, according to the FBIтАЩs Uniform Crime Report data from 2003 to 2017. But in late March, the FBI warned of the likely increase of hate crimes against Asian Americans as the global health crisis continues. For mental health experts, this spike in racist incidents has serious implications for the mental health of Asian Americans, as growing research indicates a link between racial discrimination and anxiety and depression, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. In a 2013 review of 121 studies examining the relationship between racism and youth well being, researchers found that youth who had experienced discrimination were significantly more likely to encounter mental health problems. A 2007 study featuring 2,047 Asian American survey respondents identified racial discrimination as a significant predictor of mental health disorders over a 12-month period. Gilbert Gee, a professor in the department of community health sciences at the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California Los Angeles, commented on the bodyтАЩs response to encountering such discriminatory behavior. тАЬWhen people are treated unfairly, it can create a stress response called allostatic load,тАЭ he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. тАЬAllostatic load can impair the body in many ways, such as weakening our immune systems.тАЭ Kevin Nadal, a psychologist and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice who researches the mental health effects of microaggressions, emphasized the importance of acknowledging the fear of experiencing racism. тАЬEven if people arenтАЩt experiencing direct incidents, just the knowledge of it can cause them to feel anxious, depressed, or hypervigilant, which can lead to other mental health issues,тАЭ Nadal also told the Philadelphia Inquirer. тАЬItтАЩs a collective trauma тАФ the anticipation comes from people of your shared identity having experienced violence.тАЭ The rhetoric of some government officials and media outlets has also appeared to have an active role in the uptick of anti-Asian behavior. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, in a study conducted by Gee, an analysis of nearly one million tweets between November and March suggest that negative comments about Asians increased by 70 percent. Gee also found that negative comments about Asians spiked by 167 percent the week following President Donald TrumpтАЩs referral to COVID-19 as the тАЬChina virusтАЭ during press briefings and on social media platforms. Suzanne Chong, a psychologist at Ursinus College, urged individuals who have faced discrimination and race-based attacks to find support from friends, family, community and religious leaders, as well as mental health professionals because тАЬacknowledging the reality of racism and the impact тАж will help dispel the heaviness and burden of being targets,тАЭ she told the Philadelphia Inquirer. тАЬOffer your empathy and be an ally against racism,тАЭ Chong added. тАЬYour presence is the best salve against acts of cruelty.тАЭ Numerous campaigns and community efforts have heeded this call of extending empathy and resisting racism. Some of these organized efforts include the #RacismIsAVirus and #Washthehate social media campaigns. Joining many of these efforts is a new community relief initiativeтАУHeart of DinnerтАУthat delivers home-cooked meals and handwritten notes of love to Asian seniors in New York City struggling with isolation and xenophobia. Co-founded by Tsai and Yin Chang, this initiative is one of the many mutual aid groups created in New York to support vulnerable community members through helping them get food, groceries, and other necessary supplies, VICE news reports.

2314,Postponed Asian American Film Festivals Work Together Post-Shutdown,"By Dino-Ray Ramos Associate Editor/Reporter EditorsтАЩ Note: With full acknowledgment of the big-picture implications of a pandemic that has already claimed thousands of lives, cratered global economies and closed international borders, DeadlineтАЩs Coping With COVID-19 Crisis series is a forum for those in the entertainment space grappling with myriad consequences of seeing a great industry screech to a halt. The hope is for an exchange of ideas and experiences, and suggestions on how businesses and individuals can best ride out a crisis that doesnтАЩt look like it will abate any time soon. If you have a story, email mike@deadline.com.┬а The month of May marks Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and three of the biggest Asian film festivals in the country тАФ Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, Center For Asian American MediaтАЩs CAAMFest in San Francisco, and San Diego Asian Film Festival тАФ were revving up to showcase films and projects from all avenues of the Asian diaspora to help build community and put a spotlight on talent from all over the world тАФ but then coronavirus happened. As the pandemic spread, Donald Trump started referring to COVID-19 as the тАЬChinese virusтАЭ and there was a rise in racist acts against Asian and Asian Americans. As film festivals across the country started dropping one by one, the directors from the trio of the aforementioned festivals prepared for the inevitable while keeping a vigilant eye on what was happening to the Asian community. Related Story Coping With COVID-19 Crisis: Hollywood's Asian Community Calls On Allies For Support As Coronavirus Misinformation Incites Hate In Los Angeles, Francis Cullado, Executive Director of Visual Communications, the group behind the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival (LAAPFF) said that the group starts planning for the festival a year-and-a-half out. LAAPFF, now in its 36th year, was set to kick off Asian Pacific American Heritage Month on April 30 and continue through May 8. When Cullado heard that SXSW was canceled, he was heartbroken, but he also knew this was a precedent-setting situation.┬а тАЬWeтАЩve always planned ahead in case of direct things that can happen to our festival,тАЭ Cullado said. тАЬChanges in venues, weather тАФ but this is something different. It affects everyone and it shows how reliant we all are to each other.тАЭ Masashi Niwano, Festival & Exhibition Director at the Center for Asian American Media, the organization that puts on CAAMFest also knew that other festivals would be canceled or rescheduled. CAAMFest, which is in its 38th year, was set to follow LAAPFF and carry the torch of Asian film festivals from May 14-24.┬а Meanwhile, Kent Lee, Executive Director of Pacific Arts Movement, was prepping for that eventтАЩs 10th annual Spring Showcase set for April 16-23 and the San Diego Asian Film Festival (SDAFF) which typically takes place in the fall. The festivals screen titles from fests like SXSW and the Tribeca Film Festival so since those were canceled, all three postponed their events to later dates that have yet to be announced. Even though these fests are not like SXSW and Cannes, Cullado points out that specialty fests like LAAPFF, CAAMFest and SDAFF play an important role in the festival ecosystem. тАЬWe are one of the major film festivals in Los Angeles and our programming, while campaigning Asian Pacific artists and stories, is intersectional and creates cross-connections,тАЭ said Cullado. тАЬWhile we showcase films from across the globe, weтАЩre also very hyper-local.тАЭ Niwano shares the sentiment. тАЬWe are a bridge between culture, art, storytelling and community,тАЭ he said. тАЬCanceling a festival is devastating on so many levels, including loss of expected revenue from memberships, ticket sales and grant/sponsor funds to stay sustainable. For now, filmmakers have to reenvision their distribution strategies and find audiences in new ways.тАЭ тАЬNo one wants to postpone or cancel a festival or event тАФ regardless of whether it features 15 or 500 films,тАЭ said Lee. тАЬSure, smaller festivals like our Spring Showcase may not be seen as having the same weight on the festival circuit or impact on market decisions. What we do have in common, however, are the people we serve тАФ the filmmakers, artists and our audiencesтАжrely on festivals of all sizes in order to be connected together.тАЭ He continues, тАЬFestivals like SDAFF are vital platforms that showcase voices and stories that might otherwise be inaccessible to the public.тАЭ The festivals have been platform to spotlight Asian narratives. In recent years, the LAAPFF, CAAMFest and SDAFF have played host to films like Justin ChonтАЩs Gook and Ms. Purple as well as Lulu WangтАЩs The Farewell, Gurinder ChadhaтАЩs Blinded By The Light and the docuseries We GonтАЩ Be Alright from Bao Nguyen, who directed the Bruce Lee docu Be Water which premiered at Sundance earlier this year. It also served as a platform for up and coming voices including Diane ParagasтАЩs Yellow Rose, Andrea WalterтАЩs Empty By Design, H.P. MendozaтАЩs Bitter Melon and Kulap VilaysakтАЩs Origin Story. These festivals have also celebrated milestones in Asian film and TV, honoring Wayne WangтАЩs Joy Luck Club, Justin LinтАЩs groundbreaking film Better Luck Tomorrow and reuniting the cast of Margaret ChoтАЩs All-American Girl. All have conributed to the growth of Asian representation in Hollywood, paving the way for films like Crazy Rich Asians and shows like Fresh Off the Boat. That said, the postponement of all three festivals is upsetting at a time when there is a need for strong, authentic representation for Asian and Asian Americans as many of them were being subjected to acts of hate. тАЬSadly, there is a long history of marginalized communities scapegoated and discriminated against, especially during hard times,тАЭ said Niwano in regard to the rise of discrimination against Asians during the pandemic. тАЬThis is why representation matters, on every screen. The more we, as a nation, see understand and empathize with people outside of our own communities, the better we are.тАЭ Niwano adds as we struggle through the pandemic, racism of any kind should be the least of our collective concerns, but unfortunately, there has been a surge in Asian harassment. And it continues to grow. Across social media platforms and in news stories, Asians have been sharing their stories. The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council has launched Stop AAPI Hate, an open forum to report discrimination against Asian Americans. They launched March 19 and in the first two weeks received 1,135 reports тАФ and that number keeps growing. Last week, a group of Senate Democrats called on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to take action against the violence against Asians that has been on the rise since the pandemic began. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and Hawaii Sen. Mazie K. Hirono led the charge with a letter that urged chair Catherine E. Lhamon to address these xenophobic acts to help prevent them. тАЬFrom being profiled while out grocery shopping to physical acts of violence, Asian Americans are unfortunately only shocked by how this pandemic has merely surfaced xenophobic sentiments that are typically masked in some way,тАЭ said Lee. тАЬWe have always needed representation on screen that reflects the diversity of Asians and Asian Americans and media has always had the power of inspiring understanding and compassion. Once again, we are reminded that there is always still a long journey ahead.тАЭ Although the new dates for LAAPFF and CAAMFest are still in the works and the impact of SDAFFтАЩs November fest is still unknown, Cullado, Niwano and Lee are exploring opportunities to work together and with other Asian film festivals across the country to unify in an effort to shine a brighter light on Asian representation to combat the widespread discrimination.┬а тАЬWeтАЩve been communication about our different festivals and identifying creative opportunities to work together in the future,тАЭ said Niwano. тАЬThis also expands larger to other Asian American and Asian Canadian film festivals. Because each festival has our own local microcosm of cultural events and film festivals, it is tricky to coordinate our in-person experiences. At the core, we are thinking of our filmmakers and want to be thoughtful about their potentially limited travel schedules and also creative ways to build more buzz around their films. It makes sense for our festivals to work together in some manner.тАЭ тАЬWhile the current landscape has our festivals imagining and creating other modes of engagement and presentation, all of us are looking forward to presenting a festival that brings our communities together,тАЭ added Cullado. тАЬAnd when that happens, we hope our communities have a more sustained, heightened awareness of what the power of media is. While media can be used to destroy, our festivals utilize media to build and connect communities.тАЭ Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy.

2336,"Every 7th doctor in United States is Indian and they're working as soldiers, fighting COVID-19: AAPI","Founded in 1982, the AAPI represents a conglomeration of more than 100,000 practicing physicians in the US. Published: 27th April 2020 03:33 PM | Last Updated: 27th April 2020 03:33 PM | A+A A- Image for representational purpose only (Photo | AP) NEW YORK: Governments across the world will have to lift shutdowns and re-open their economies in a well-planned manner or else the deadly coronavirus will return and the damage will be even worse, the president of an Indian-origin US physicians' organisation has said. American Physicians of Indian-Origin (AAPI) President Dr Suresh Reddy, applauding the hundreds of thousands of Indian-origin medical personnel bravely fighting against the virus, said that ""every 7th doctor in the US is an Indian and they are at the frontlines, working as soldiers and fighting the virus"". The entire medical fraternity has become the Army right now, fighting the coronavirus,"" Reddy told PTI in an interview here. The fight against the virus will be a long one, Reddy said, adding that COVID-19 is not going to end in a couple of months and could last for 1-2 years until a vaccine or antiviral agent is developed. That is the only way we can control it, he said. Noting that it is understandable that people are getting anxious, tired and exhausted with the shutdowns and restrictions, Reddy said any re-opening and lifting of lockdowns has to be done in a very careful and gradual manner. It will be a very slow process. I don't think it will be a sudden opening or closing of the gates. If we don't do it carefully, in a well-planned manner, then the virus will come back and the damage will be even worse, he said. Reddy stressed that the battle to defeat the COVID-19 is a three-pronged attack that involved the governments implementing measures to control the outbreak, doctors and the medical fraternity providing essential treatment and the general population by the amount of discipline they show. FOLLOW CORONAVIRUS LIVE UPDATES HERE The people are the ones who spread or control the disease. It is within their hands. As long as they follow the rules strictly, I think we will be able to break this disease, kill this Rakshas' virus and we will have a wonderful Diwali, Reddy said. He said that even at some point when the restrictions are relaxed, life will not be what people were used to before the pandemic. I don't think things will ever return to being totally normal. We will be washing hands more often, wearing masks more often in public places. So, it will be a new future, new normal, he said. Reddy pointed out that both in India and the US, the shutdown and people wearing masks are some measures through which the situation is being brought under control. Founded in 1982, the AAPI represents a conglomeration of more than 100,000 practicing physicians in the US. It has raised USD 100,000 to buy protective equipment for doctors and is also hosting webinars and hotlines to provide assistance to members of the community, including students and parents visiting from India who do not have access to health insurance and cannot get prescription for medicines. Reddy said that as the US emerges from the pandemic, a lesson that will be learnt is that America will have to set up its own manufacturing bases so that it does not have to depend on China for supplies. If we had manufacturing companies in the US making masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) for example, we would not have had the problem of scarcity of supplies. Everybody had to run to China to get masks, PPE, ventilators, Reddy said. He lauded the efforts of the Indian-origin physicians, saying AAPI is extremely proud of the troops on the frontlines. We will all prevail, he said. The US government officials have appreciated the work of Indian doctors and community members, he said. Everybody in the US knows that we are a strong medical community and we are contributing a lot, Reddy said. He said AAPI is also working closely with Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu and the embassy in helping and reaching out to Indians in distress. Indian-American Al Mason, an advisor to Global Real Estate Investments Educational Hospitals, said that due credit should be given to the Indian embassy under the guidance and leadership of Sandhu, who are doing a great job, tirelessly reaching out to the Indian American community in this crisis. He lauded the efforts of Consul General in New York Sandeep Chakravorty in ensuring assistance to those in need across the state, which is the epicenter of the pandemic in the US. Overseas Volunteer for a Better India (OVBI), a US-based non-profit organisation, is also mobilising efforts to provide assistance. So far, it has donated 25,000 meals to New York food banks for the homeless and daily wage earners without a job presently, 4,000 N95 masks to health care professionals and medical equipment to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center. It is also facilitating collaboration between doctors, technologists and entrepreneurs to provide innovative solutions to help with the COVID-19 crisis in India and a plasma registry that will help save lives of the critically ill. The United States, which is the worst-hit country, has the highest number of deaths with more than 55,000 fatalities from more than 980,000 cases.

2359,How AAPI groups are changing census outreach amid coronavirus,"Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Census tract 849 is the sliver of Queens, New York, where Chuck Park and others from the MinKwon Center for Community Action were to ring doorbells to get people to answer the survey. Only about half of that tract, which includes many residents of Asian descent, completed their forms the last time the census was done, in 2010. Park, a civic participation manager with the nonprofit, was hoping to change that. They would deliver quick messages in Mandarin, Spanish and English about the importance of the congressionally mandated headcount, explaining that itтАЩs used to decide how billions of dollars in federal funding are distributed. Once they got some buy-in, theyтАЩd take out their internet-enabled iPads and allow respondents to complete the electronic form on the spot. тАЬAll of that was obviously tossed aside given the COVID-19 outbreak and pandemic,тАЭ Park told NBC Asian America. Measures like sheltering-in-place and social distancing to flatten the curve have forced nonprofits across the country to retool their census outreach strategies. Among them are members of the Asian Pacific American Complete Count Committee, a citywide coalition of more than a dozen groups targeting hard-to-count census tracts in New York City, the COVID-19 epicenter. The committeeтАЩs efforts extend to parts of Queens, one of the most diverse counties in the country and home to Elmhurst Hospital, which has been on the front lines of treating coronavirus patients. ""Our communities were already at risk for low response rates before the crisis,тАЭ Annetta Seecharran, executive director of Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a Queens-based nonprofit co-leading the committee with MinKwon Center, said in an email. Because of the pandemic, the Census Bureau said itтАЩs now planning to give people until Oct. 31 тАФ instead of July 31 тАФ to self-respond to the census online, by phone or by mail. Census workers will follow up from Aug. 11 to Oct. 31 with households that donтАЩt respond. Field operations are slated to resume June 1. The Trump administration is also seeking congressional legislation to delay delivery of the state population counts used for apportionment, the process of dividing up House seats, according to a statement Monday from Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. That deadline would be moved to April 30, 2021, from Dec. 31, 2020. The administration also wants to push back the date for giving states data for redistricting from next March to next July, the statement said. This comes as the COVID-19 health crisis, coupled with the fact that Asian Americans are least likely to fill out the census form, has renewed fears of an undercount. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus sent a letter Tuesday to the Census Bureau, urging it to pump up paid outreach advertising and address long wait times at census call centers, among other things. In the tract Park and his organization were to visit, just 1 in 4 people have so far completed the survey. тАЬWe are concerned the count will remain low due to illness in the family, loss of life, loss of income, loss of a job, and fear of losing one's home, which all make over-the-horizon thinking and civic participation ever the more daunting,"" Seecharran said. The census, conducted every 10 years, is used to decide the number of seats awarded to states in the House of Representatives, the way representative boundaries are drawn, and how more than $675 billion a year in federal funds is distributed. ItтАЩs also used in determining which states and counties are required to provide voter language assistance according to the Voting Rights Act. An inaccurate count could affect funding levels for programs like Medicaid, food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, as well as grants and loans for state and local governments, companies and nonprofits. People living in immigrant-rich neighborhoods like those in Queens are among the ones who could lose out the most. тАЬIтАЩm not surprised that many of the neighborhoods hardest hit by COVID-19 also had the lowest response rates in the last census,тАЭ Park said. тАЬThese are Hispanic and Asian immigrant neighborhoods like Elmhurst, Corona, Jackson Heights. The 2010 undercount starved those communities of resources for 10 years.тАЭ Park said most groups doing census outreach are now leaning heavily on phone and text banking. But because the lists of names are culled from public or commercially available databases, people who are undocumented, not registered voters or do not have bank accounts are likely to be missed, Park said. In the Midwest, which has seen some of the fastest rates of Asian American growth in the last decade, similar efforts are underway. Sheila Dorsey Vinton, executive director of the Asian Community and Cultural Center, a nonprofit in Lincoln, Nebraska, said they too are phone banking. Her volunteers and staffers provide the people they reach with different Census Bureau phone numbers they can call to complete the survey in a language other than English. LincolnтАЩs self-response rate is around 60 percent, higher than the national average. тАЬI think that our staff has had a lot of success in getting people to fill out the form,тАЭ said Dorsey Vinton, whose organization serves all immigrants and refugees, including Vietnamese, Chinese and Karen people from Myanmar. But, she added, тАЬI am concerned that we haven't been able to reach everybody.тАЭ In New York City, Park said the MinKwon Center and other organizations involved in census outreach are also trying to engage the community through social media. That includes using KakaoTalk, a Korean-language messaging app; WeChat, for Chinese-language speakers; and WhatsApp, popular among South Asians. Park said his group also spent more than $10,000 on ads to run in Korean-language newspapers and on radio stations. Still, outreach workers and volunteers worry that completing the survey could take a back seat to more immediate concerns from COVID-19, like worrying about unemployment and having to put food on the table. Park said theyтАЩre trying to make their messaging more timely by connecting it to the coronavirus health crisis. тАЬSo we're saying things like, the decisions on where to put hospitals and health centers is tied to census responses,тАЭ he said. Indeed, itтАЩs all hands on deck for groups that spent the past few years readying to do in-person outreach тАФ only to have their plans derailed by COVID-19 тАФ as they try to stave off a potential undercount. тАЬWe will continue to work until the last day when people can respond to make sure that our community participates,тАЭ said Terry Ao Minnis, senior director of census and voting programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a nonprofit.

2439,Asian Americans use social media to mobilize against racially motivated attacks,"(AP) -- Asian Americans are using social media to organize and fight back against racially motivated attacks during the coronavirus pandemic. A string of racist run-ins in the last two weeks has given rise to hashtags and online forums to report hate. FBI predicts attacks will increase as infections grow.

2447,Asian American Groups Find Innovative Ways for Census,"Get the best experience and stay connected to your community with our Spectrum News app. Learn More Continue in Browser 0 AUSTIN, Texas-- With the pandemic occupying many of us right now, itтАЩs hard to think of the census, but the process is underway and is one of few things still going on as planned. One of the groups that runs the risk of being undercounted is Asian Americans. According to a Census Bureau study, only 55 percent of the community say they are тАЬextremelyтАЭ or тАЬveryтАЭ likely to fill out the census. That percentage is lower than white (69 percent) Hispanic (65 percent) and black populations (64 percent). But some Asian American groups in Texas are trying to make sure that underrepresentation doesn't happen. And they're coming up with new ideas, since knocking on doors and holding outreach events are not possible right now. Shubhada Saxena is the founder of Asian American Impact and the organization is encouraging the community to come up with fun videos with song, poetry, dance and other fun activities to tell people the importance of the census. тАЬWe had a project or event set for March 29. Unfortunately, because of the current situation, we could not have a physical event. So we made that into a virtual space where now children are at home with their families. So they are creating videos with their families with different generations and telling the story differently,тАЭ said Saxena. Malin Pathak is an IT professional in Austin and won the Mrs. South Asia International title last year. She put together a video in different languages to reach people of more than 40 countries who are counted as Asian Americans. тАЬI thought it would be perfect to get some of my friends, specifically from Asia, come together in one single video and be able to inspire their own respective communities,тАЭ said Pathak. They are encouraging people to post videos on their Census 2020 Facebook page with #Iamcounted or email the videos to seema@cosmocitymedia.com.",0,0,0,0
2455,2020 Census: What├втВмтДвs at Stake for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,"Communities that are undercounted may be denied their fair share of federal funding and political representation. Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the United States. However, a study by AAPIData at the University of California found that Asian Americans were less likely than any other demographic group to say they intended to participate in the 2020 Census. They are also the group that is least familiar with the census тАФ and the most worried that their answers to the census тАЬwill be used against them.тАЭ These challenges risk exacerbating the undercounting of Asian Americans in the census тАФ a problem that has persisted for decades тАФ and one that could undermine efforts by Asian Americans to secure federal funding, mobilize political power, and gather critical information on their communities. But grassroots organizations are making a strong push in their census outreach to Asian American communities and encouraging individuals to get counted. Sixteen million people in the United States were not counted during the 2010 Census, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, and Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have been undercounted for decades тАФ a problem that could deny communities their fair share of federal funding and political representation. Federal, state, and local officials rely on census statistics to help determine how to allocate federal funding for major healthcare programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, ChildrenтАЩs Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and a number of reproductive health programs. Census data also helps decide the distribution of funding for education programs, including bilingual language programs, the National School Lunch Program, and Tier I grants, which provides financial assistance to schools and local education agencies with large numbers of low-income students. But when communities are undercounted, they may receive less than their fair share of resources from these government programs тАФ and some Asian-American communities may be particularly at risk. Around 13 percent of Asian Americans and 15 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders lack health insurance coverage, with higher percentages within specific groups тАФ as high as 22 percent for Nepalese Americans. And while Asian Americans have a relatively high rate of educational attainment overall, the disaggregated data reveals significantly lower rates among certain groups. For example, 62 percent of Bhutanese and 50 percent of Burmese Americans lack a high school degree. An accurate census is also essential for helping ensure that Asian Americans receive adequate political representation тАФ and are able to participate in U.S. democracy. The Voting Rights Act requires jurisdictions to provide language assistance for Asian American, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native voters at the polls, such as translated ballots and bilingual poll workers. Census statistics help dictate the specific languages or dialects in which jurisdictions will offer that assistance. Additionally, census results inform the political redistricting process, which determines the districts and number of seats for both the House of Representatives and state legislatures for the ensuing decade. Finally, the census is an important tool for documenting the diversity of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in the United States тАФ and the social, economic, and political disparities within them. Even though they stand to benefit from an accurate count, many Asian Americans are worried about participating in the census. According to a 2019 Census Bureau report, 41 percent of Asian American survey respondents were concerned that their answers тАЬwill be used against them.тАЭ In contrast, Black, Latino, and white respondents were, respectively, 35 percent, 32 percent, and 16 percent likely to express the same concern. Fears around census participation may partially stem from the current political environment. In 2018, for example, the Trump administration proposed adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, even though the question would have significantly reduced census participation. Legal challenges ensued, and, in a victory for the census and the country, the Supreme Court struck down the question, ruling that the administrationтАЩs decision to add it violated federal law. Despite that ruling and the fact that a citizenship question cannot appear on the 2020 census, some remain confused or worried about the implications of filling out a census form, perhaps a response to the administrationтАЩs reputation for anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Additionally, some Muslim immigrants are worried about the confidentiality of the census, particularly in the wake of TrumpтАЩs ongoing anti-Muslim rhetoric and his administrationтАЩs travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. For some, the recent legal battle over the citizenship question echoed a historic event during which the federal government actually did use citizenship information against Asian Americans. During World War II, Congress passed the Second War Powers Act, which allowed the federal government to obtain confidential census information and use it to identify people of Japanese descent тАФ and forcibly incarcerate 120,000 individuals in internment camps. That could not happen again under todayтАЩs strict census confidentiality laws, which prevent the Census Bureau from disclosing personally identifiable information or from using census data to harm people. But anxieties from the memories of Japanese internment linger nonetheless. Even if they overcome fears about the census, many Asian Americans still face significant hurdles to actually participating in it. Approximately one in five Asian Americans and one-third of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders live in hard-to-count census tracts. Asian Americans are also the racial group with the highest language barriers, with 35 percent who speak English тАЬless than very well.тАЭ Currently, the official census questionnaire is available in only five Asian languages тАФ Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese тАФ although other census resources and materials are available in additional languages in some jurisdictions. Despite these hurdles, there are major efforts to encourage Asian Americans to participate in the census. For example, in the last year, the organization Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote has provided training for 750 local groups for census outreach in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC) has played a major role in pushing Congress and the Census Bureau to conduct the census in ways that will remove barriers to participation for Asian Americans and maximize their count. AAJC has also compiled and published an exhaustive list of resources from partner organizations, organized under the campaign Count Us In 2020. And at the state level, there are Asian Pacific American Complete Count Committees across the country working with local governments and community organizations on census outreach efforts. Together, these efforts should help achieve a more accurate count of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities in the United States and ensure they get their fair share of federal funding and political representation in the next decade.",0,0,0,0
2482,Asian Americans use social media to mobilize against attacks,"WJHL | Tri-Cities News & Weather by: The Associated Press Kyle Navarro was kneeling down to unlock his bicycle when he noticed an older white man staring at him. Navarro, who is Filipino, tried to ignore him, but that soon became impossible. The man walked by, looked back and called Navarro a racial slur. He тАЬspat in my direction, and kept walking,тАЭ Navarro said. Navarro, a school nurse in San Francisco, already had anxiety about racism related to the coronavirus, which emerged in China and has Asian people facing unfounded blame and attacks as itтАЩs spread worldwide. Now, he was outraged. тАЬMy first instinct was to yell back at him in anger. But, after taking a breath, I realized that would have put me in danger,тАЭ Navarro said. Instead, he took to Twitter last week to turn the ugly moment into an opportunity for a conversation about racism, generating thousands of sympathetic comments. Asian Americans are using social media to organize and fight back against racially motivated attacks during the pandemic, which the FBI predicts will increase as infections grow. A string of racist run-ins in the last two weeks has given rise to hashtags тАФ #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19 тАФ and online forums to report incidents. Critics say President Donald Trump made things worse by calling COVID-19 the тАЬChinese virus.тАЭ For a group with a history of being scapegoated тАФ from Japanese Americans detained during World War II to a Chinese American man killed by autoworkers angry about Japanese competition in the тАЩ80s тАФ thereтАЩs urgency to drown out both bigotry and apathy. To that end, the California-based groups Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council set up a hate reporting center last month. New YorkтАЩs attorney general also launched a hotline. тАЬWe kind of just knew from history this was going to snowball,тАЭ said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. тАЬWith the rising stress and anxiety, we knew weтАЩd see a rise in hate incidents.тАЭ The center has fielded more than 1,000 reports from across the U.S., ranging from people spitting to throwing bottles from cars. An FBI report distributed to local law enforcement predicts the attacks will surge and pointed to the stabbing of an Asian American man and his two children at a SamтАЩs Club in Texas last month, ABC News reported. According to the report, the 19-year-old suspect said he thought they were тАЬinfecting people.тАЭ The victims have recovered. Amid the explosive climate, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang drew backlash for urging fellow Asian Americans to display more тАЬAmerican-ness.тАЭ In a Washington Post editorial Wednesday, he called on them to avoid confrontation and do acts of goodwill like volunteering and helping neighbors. тАЬBeing тАШthe good AsianтАЩ has not fared well for Asian Americans,тАЭ Choi said. тАЬWe donтАЩt have to prove our worth and that we belong, that weтАЩre exceptional. And we certainly donтАЩt have to believe that this is something that we should ignore.тАЭ YangтАЩs spokesman declined to comment. Meanwhile, Trump has walked back on calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus, saying at a media briefing and on Twitter last week that Asian Americans should not be blamed тАЬin any way, shape or form.тАЭ Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House worry the damage has been done and have introduced resolutions to condemn anti-Asian racism. тАЬHis followers continue to double-down on that term,тАЭ said U.S. Rep. Judy Chu of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Some of the reports received by the advocacy groups describe harassment that appears to parrot Trump, Choi said. A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred to TrumpтАЩs remarks at the March 23 briefing. The presidentтАЩs words also drew some Asian Americans in entertainment and fashion to the #WashTheHate social media campaign last month. Celia Au, star of the Netflix show тАЬWu Assassins,тАЭ and others posted videos showing them washing their hands and talking about the effect of racism. тАЬIt comes from the top down at the end of the day,тАЭ Au said. тАЬOur top leader is not doing the job, so itтАЩs time for us to step up.тАЭ People turning against Asian Americans in an uncertain time and sputtering economy echoes the climate in 1982, when Vincent Chin was killed in Detroit as laid-off autoworkers blamed a recession on Japanese competition. тАЬAt that time, I knew I had to watch out and be careful тАФ who I was around, how they looked at me,тАЭ said Helen Zia, a Chinese American author and journalist from Oakland, California, who lived in Detroit at the time. тАЬI think weтАЩre in that stage now.тАЭ Two white autoworkers beat Chin to death with a bat outside a strip club during his bachelor party simply because they thought he was Japanese. The 27-year-oldтАЩs attackers were convicted of manslaughter and got just three years of probation. Zia said she and others contacted advocacy groups, churches and Chinese-language media about protesting the sentence. Relying only on mail and telephones, they found allies in the NAACP and Anti-Defamation League and launched demonstrations nationwide. тАЬIt was a watershed moment,тАЭ Zia said. тАЬWe were drowning, and we had to organize to change what we saw going on around us.тАЭ Thanks to social media, younger generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are speaking up during what could be another seminal moment. Choi hopes they will rally non-Asians to see the wave of racist attacks in the COVID-19 era as their issue, too. Groups like the NAACP and Council on American-Islamic Relations have condemned anti-Asian rhetoric. With attacks escalating, Zia canтАЩt help but fear the pandemic could result in another tragedy like ChinтАЩs death. тАЬThe level of anger тАж itтАЩs already here,тАЭ Zia said. тАЬFor Asian Americans, thereтАЩs the virus of COVID-19 and thereтАЩs the virus of hate. The hate virus is also going to get much worse.тАЭ Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

2692,5 Asian American Poets You Should Know - Read Poetry,"Photo by Tom Hines┬а Asian American representation in poetry spans a wide range of generations, regions, and cultures. Contributions have been made by Asian Americans for at least a century, but only in the last fifty years have they begun to take a place on the mainstage. To celebrate the poets whoтАЩve brought Asian American perspectives to the forefront of poetry, weтАЩve made a list of 5 incredibly influential Asian American poets.┬а A fourth-generation Japanese-American poet, Garrett Hongo draws on his own experiences and Japanese American history. Hongo has published three books of poetry: Yellow Light (1982), The River of Heaven (1988), and Volcano: A Memoir of HawaiтАЩi (1995). While all three collections were well-received, River of Heaven skyrocketed Hongo into center stage after becoming a Lamont Poetry Selection and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. New York Times-bestselling poet Ocean Vuong cites Hongo as one of his earliest influences. тАЬHongoтАЩs poems were the welding of stories and words and writing all at once. His very existence permissioned me into the possibility of my own writing,тАЭ he told Lit Hub.┬а Recommended poem: тАЬThe LegendтАЭ┬а This Bangalore-born and Ohio-raised poet, essayist, and literary critic won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry after publishing his collection 3 Sections. In addition, he authored The Long Meadow (2004) and Wild Kingdom (1996). While his influences include the likes of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and William Blake, his background and upbringing also play a huge role in his work. тАЬMy race is certainly central to my life, as is India, but I was also a creature of the nineteen-sixties, and thatтАЩs been a huge thing. It has shaped my consciousness and my attitudesтАж I feel that the inner experience I had was racial and Indian, but it was also the inner experience of mid-century America,тАЭ he told The New Yorker.┬а Recommended poem: тАЬThe DisappearancesтАЭ┬а The author of nine books of poetry, a Guggenheim Fellow, and PEN/Voelcker Award-winner (just to name a few), Kimiko Hahn is one of the most well-known names in American poetry today. HahnтАЩs upbringing is split between Pleasantville, New York, and Tokyo, Japan. As a teen, she was largely involved in the New York City Asian American movement. Hahn is known for exploring the intersection of conflicting identities in her work, as her racially mixed background and appearance made her to be perceived as Asian by her American schoolmates, and American by her Japanese schoolmates. In addition to her exploration of race and body politics, her work often delves into themes of gender, feminism, violence, and grief.┬а Recommended poem: тАЬThe AshesтАЭ┬а Chang was born in Detroit Michigan to Taiwanese immigrant parents. Victoria ChangтАЩs 2017 collection Barbie Chang made waves in the literary community with its sharp language and honest yet humorous commentary. Its exploration of liminal states and restrictive roles of femininity is no stranger to her work. In an interview with Lit Hub, Chang shares that she felt very visible, yet totally invisible as she was bullied as a person of color in a predominately white town. тАЬI feel immensely grateful to those people that bullied me, not to say I would necessarily thank them today, but I donтАЩt know if I would be a writer if I were not bullied,тАЭ she said. Chang is the author of five poetry collections and two childrenтАЩs books, a Guggenheim Fellow and Pushcart Prize-winner.┬а Recommended Poem: тАЬBarbie ChangтАЩs TearsтАЭ┬а A new American literary sensation, the bestselling poet and novelist Ocean Vuong was born in Saigon and raised in Hartford, Connecticut. His upbringing informs much of his work, as he explores transformation, desire, grief, war, and melancholia. His debut poetry collection, Night Sky with Exit Wounds (2016) was widely acclaimed by critics, winning a Whiting Award, a Publishing TriangleтАЩs Thom Gunn Award, Kate Tufts Discovery Award, and Lambda Literary Award. His 2019 novel, On Earth WeтАЩre Briefly Gorgeous, followed suit as one of 2019тАЩs most anticipated books of the year. Recommended poem: DetoNation",0,0,0,0
2747,Andrew Yang faces backlash from the Asian American community over op-ed,"(NEW YORK) тАФ Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is facing backlash from the Asian American community for his column in The Washington Post last week addressing racism surrounding the novel coronavirus. The article, titled тАЬWe Asian Americans are not the virus, but we can be part of the cure,тАЭ was published April 1 in response to the recent surge of discrimination against Asian Americans amid coronavirus fears. It starts with YangтАЩs recent experience at a grocery store when he writes he felt judged and demeaned. тАЬFor the first time in years, I felt it. I felt self-conscious тАФ even a bit ashamed тАФ of being Asian,тАЭ Yang wrote. In many cases, that unease and wariness towards Asian Americans manifested into harassment and violent attacks around the country, including a man in New York City who was sprayed with air freshener while riding the subway, a Filipino boy bullied at a California middle school and the stabbing of an Asian American family in Midland, Texas, where the suspect allegedly claimed he targeted the family because they were Chinese. As a way to improve the current situation, Yang implored Asian Americans to demonstrate they are part of the solution by embracing тАЬour American-ness in ways we never have before.тАЭ тАЬWe need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need,тАЭ Yang wrote in his op-ed. Jenny Yang, an Asian American comedian and writer whoтАЩs known for using her work to address Asian American issues, said this is the wrong message. тАЬI felt my stomach sink,тАЭ Jenny Yang told ABC News. тАЬAndrew is telling us we cannot expect telling people to not be racist to work, so we should lean in to be more American so we will be less threatening to other Americans,тАЭ тАФ a direct reference to YangтАЩs words in the article, тАЬI obviously think that being racist is not a good thing. But saying, тАШDonтАЩt be racist toward Asians,тАЩ wonтАЩt work.тАЭ Two days after the article was published, Jenny Yang posted a video of her attempting to take the former presidential candidateтАЩs advice and embrace her тАЬAmerican-nessтАЭ in order to show тАЬhow ridiculous this premise was.тАЭ In the video, she is dressed in red, white and blue and is standing on the street with a sign that reads, тАЬHonk if you wonтАЩt hate crime me,тАЭ while handing out Clorox wipes to strangers. The video had garnered over 78,400 views through Sunday morning. тАЬWe are fighting two viruses at once,тАЭ Simu Liu, an Asian Canadian actor whoтАЩs best known in his role in the TV show тАЬKimтАЩs Convenience,тАЭ said, calling YangтАЩs op-ed тАЬa slap in the face.тАЭ Set to play Shang Chi, the first Asian American superhero in the Marvel Universe, Liu initially responded on April 2 to the piece on Twitter: тАЬAt a time where Asian diaspora from around the world are experiencing massive racism and discrimination, @AndrewYang basically just told us to suck it up, eat a cheeseburger and buy an American flag.тАЭ To which Yang responded the next day, тАЬJust saying that we need to do all we can to ease this crisis and step up in this time of national and global need,тАЭ adding that heтАЩs proud of his heritage and knows people will have different takes. Liu, who said he recently experienced harassment when someone yelled тАЬcoronavirusтАЭ at him outside a restaurant in Sydney, said he appreciates the dialogue from Yang but believes he backpedaled and failed to address the problem. тАЬIt frames the onus on us, somehow we have to prove we are worthy of belonging. We do belong, the burden should not be on us,тАЭ Liu told ABC News. YangтАЩs team had no comment when ABC News reached out for a response. The call for Asian Americans to display their тАЬAmerican-nessтАЭ was only part of the problem, experts argue. YangтАЩs invocation of Japanese-Americans who volunteered for military duty during World War II, without proper historical context, was another point of contention, they said. тАЬMany in our community, during and after the forced removal of our families in тАЩ42, argued precisely what Yang is saying. Just be good Americans, donтАЩt make waves or protest, show how patriotic we are and everything will be fine. Well, my family lost their constitutional rights. I wouldnтАЩt consider that тАШjust fine,""тАЭ Bruce Embrey, the co-chair of the Manzanar Committee, a nonprofit organization dedicated to raise awareness about the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in World War II, told ABC News. Embrey, who had four uncles serve in WWII, says their heroism shows an incomplete story. His motherтАЩs family was held at Manzanar, a concentration camp in California, where there were protests and strikes. Japanese-Americans spoke up and actively challenged the notion of patriotism, Embrey added, and that led to progress like the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which offered redress to every Japanese-American incarcerated during the war. тАЬFighting for oneтАЩs rights against inequality and racism has been a constant in our nationтАЩs history. Fighting back is as American as you can get,тАЭ Embrey said. This isnтАЩt the first time Yang has found himself in hot water with the Asian community. He faced criticism when he used racial stereotypes in his speeches, saying the тАЬopposite of Donald Trump is an Asian guy who likes math,тАЭ referring to his campaign slogan тАЬMake America Think Harder.тАЭ In a September Democratic presidential debate, Yang said, тАЬIтАЩm Asian so I know a lot of doctorsтАЭ when addressing the health care system in the U.S. Author and journalist Jeff Yang, whose work has focused on Asian American identity, points out that Yang has a unique and challenging role when it comes to representing Asian Americans in national politics, a community thatтАЩs тАЬalmost as diverse as the country at large.тАЭ The complex nature of the group is why Yang needs to be more thoughtful, Jeff Yang told ABC News, especially with such a significant platform. He said Andrew Yang should clarify peopleтАЩs perceptions of Asian Americans rather than dilute them into racial tropes. In March, the FBI released an analysis predicting an increase in hate-crime incidents against Asian Americans тАЬbased on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations.тАЭ The analysis indicated there has already been an increase in reports of hate crimes from Los Angeles to New York to Texas. With the rising wave of coronavirus-related racism, groups like the Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action and San Francisco State UniversityтАЩs Asian American Studies Department launched sites allowing people to report cases. In just the past two weeks, they have received over 1,100 reports with incidents ranging from verbal harassment and shunning to physical assault. Asian American Advancing Justice, the nationтАЩs largest Asian American legal and civil rights organization, has also been tracking coronavirus-related racist incidents. Stewart Kwoh, founder of Asian American Advancing Justice, believes the winning strategy to combat racist behavior is twofold: first, people need to stand up, call it out and mobilize other groups for support, and second, there needs to be unity against the virus, our common enemy. тАЬI think he (Yang) neglected to emphasize the first part; he did not take a strong stand on fighting racism, thatтАЩs where the criticism is well taken,тАЭ Kwoh told ABC News. Given that, Kwoh believes YangтАЩs heart was in the right place and that some of his argument is valid. Every major shift in culture in this country came from people who spoke up, Jeff Yang said, adding, тАЬItтАЩs not about an apology, but a bigger conversation, and that means loud noises and resistance.тАЭ Copyright ┬й 2020, ABC Audio.

Updated: July 8, 2021 @ 7:27 am State and local fire crews are battling multiple fires that ignited Wednesday near theLewiston-Clarkston Valley and sent smoke billowing into the area. PULLMAN тАФ Local standouts Bryden Brown of Moscow and Lauren Greeny of Pullman each struggled Wednesday in the second round at the American Junior Golf Association tournament at Palouse Ridge Golf Club. By lending five Idaho State Police officers to Arizona to stop drug traffickers, Gov. Brad Little is wasting three weeks of their time. Leonard Pitts Jr.┬а Leonard Pitts Jr. This is for every American of Asian heritage, but one in particular. That would be Andrew Yang, the former Democratic candidate for president. Last week, with surely the best intentions, he gave Asian Americans the absolute worst advice imaginable. Indeed, advice so bad as to be painful. In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Yang recounted how he was shopping for groceries when a man fixed him with an accusatory stare. тАЬFor the first time in years,тАЭ wrote Yang, тАЬI felt it. I felt self-conscious тАФ even a bit ashamed тАФ of being Asian.тАЭ Such encounters have become sadly commonplace in the era of the coronavirus, which President Donald Trump and other racists insist on calling the тАЬChinese virusтАЭ because it originated in the city of Wuhan in China. Predictably weтАЩve seen a spate of assaults against people of Asian heritage all over the United States: A woman in San Francisco was spat upon, a boy in Los Angeles sent to the emergency room, a woman in Manhattan kicked and punched on a subway platform. YangтАЩs advice to Asian Americans for dealing with all this? Prove yourselves. тАЬWe Asian Americans,тАЭ he wrote, тАЬneed to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before. We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need.тАЭ ItтАЩs hard to imagine advice more shallow, offensive or ignorant. Certainly, each of us should do all that he or she can to mitigate this crisis. But why should that be a special responsibility of Asians? Why should they be required to prove themselves to racist morons? In effect, Yang asks Asian Americans to accept responsibility for solving a problem that is not theirs. Yes, the effect of that problem тАФ people being spat upon and beaten тАФ is a challenge for the Asian-American community and indeed, for all of us. But the problem itself тАФ the racism тАФ belongs to the racists. Besides which, this idea that you can, by force of excellence and ostentatiousness of patriotism, jolly haters into liking you, simply doesnтАЩt work. If you doubt that, ask the generations of African Americans who built businesses, earned degrees, answered AmericaтАЩs call to arms and yet are still, to this day, regarded as something lesser and other. For that matter, Asian-Americans can look to their own history, to little Japanese boys playing baseball behind barbed wire while their big brothers bled out the last of life, defending democracy in places like the Vosges Mountains in France. There in the bitter cold rains of October in 1944, a Japanese-American regiment fought one of World War IIтАЩs most ferocious battles, suffering more than 800 casualties to rescue the fabled тАЬLost BattalionтАЭ тАФ 211 Texans. And yes, the math is telling. If questions of patriotism could be resolved by sacrificing for your country, then surely any such questions about Asian Americans were answered forever in that blood-drenched soil. But those questions are a hardy weed. They bedeviled Iranian Americans during the hostage crisis and have dogged Muslims since 9/11. Now they emerge тАФ again тАФ against Asian Americans. Worse, an Asian American lends them credence. Andrew Yang should know better. Americans of Asian heritage have no obligation to prove themselves to those who beat and spit upon them.

2882,Being Asian American during this time has been a blessing in disguise,"In The Know As the U.S. continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans have found themselves not only fending off the virus itself, but the discrimination that comes with it. In March, for instance, the FBI warned of a spike in hate crimes against the Asian community as an increasing number of Americans began to associate the coronavirus with outdated stereotypes of the East Asian community. Since the end of that month, the Asian American blog NextShark has counted nearly 1,500 reported incidents of hate crimes against Asians, 69 percent of which involved a female victim. None of this should come as a surprise at this point тАФ President Trump once called the coronavirus the тАЬChina virus,тАЭ sparking a backlash from Asian American activists and politicians, who accused him of encouraging xenophobia against one of the nationтАЩs fastest-growing demographics. He then doubled down, claiming that the virus came from China. Countless Asian Americans, including former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, have since shared their fear about being targeted for simply being Asian. For many, including myself, misconceptions of and racism against Asians can be traced to the very moment we were born, and it has long contributed to struggles that we, as Asian Americans, face when balancing a bi-cultural identity. I was born to Macanese American parents in Manhattan and spent the first six years of my childhood in Woodside, Queens. Unlike Chinatown or Flushing, Woodside didnтАЩt have a large Chinese immigrant population тАФ most residents around me at the time were either Southeast Asian (mainly Filipino) or Central American. It was a weird time. My parents werenтАЩt too fluent in English, so they relied on neighbors and family friends to take care of me тАФ even though none of those people could speak Cantonese, my parentsтАЩ native tongue. While we didnтАЩt share the same language, we all shared the immigrant experience. My father, for example, had come to New York in the early 1980s to study at Baruch College, and my mother followed soon after to be with him. Both had come from humble beginnings тАФ my father was one of nine children who lived in a shack that was the size of a walk-in closet, and my mother was one of five whose home only had a queen-sized bed and a single bunk bed to share among seven family members. Despite my weekend trips to Chinatown and occasional vacations to Macau, my early exposure to Chinese culture was limited. I went to school with English-speaking children who were more interested in тАЬPower RangersтАЭ and тАЬLegends of the Hidden TempleтАЭ than Street Fighter and Margaret ChoтАЩs тАЬAll-American Girl.тАЭ The only connection I could make to Chinese culture was through my fatherтАЩs work ethic. The Chinese are known to be extremely hard workers and take a particular pride in it тАФ in 2019, Alibaba founder and billionaire Jack Ma, for instance, openly championed the тАЬ996тАЭ schedule, a 72-hour work schedule that most Chinese tech employees are expected to be able to manage. Though my father has never worked in the tech industry, his ethic was equivalent to that of someone in it. In his early 30s, he worked as a bank clerk while going to school to support both me and my mother. No matter how long he worked or how late he would come home, we were still dirt poor. It wasnтАЩt uncommon for us to have instant noodles and spam for dinner every other night. WeтАЩd often have to place a small rubber bin in the living room to catch water drops from a leaking ceiling. Cockroaches were rampant in our apartment. I vividly recall one day my father took us for a stroll and unexpectedly panicked because he had lost five dollars тАФ five dollars. Perplexed, my mother soon found him searching underneath parked cars. At the time, I was about 4 or 5 years old and naive. I didnтАЩt think much of the incident because I was too young to understand the value of a five-dollar bill. I had also selfishly expected my father, the familyтАЩs sole breadwinner, to come up with the financial means to support us no matter what happened. But, as I look back, that incident really spoke to his character as the typical Chinese immigrant. He had been raised in a slum and had barely had food on his table тАФ five dollars was a lot. About a decade later, my fatherтАЩs steadfastness, coupled with his seemingly excessive ambition, landed him in an executive position at a bank. His rags-to-riches story тАФ from being mockingly called тАЬPeking ManтАЭ for his then-skeletal frame to using some of his earnings to open a small Chinese antique store in ManhattanтАЩs trendy Upper East Side neighborhood тАФ epitomized the American Dream. Although I had moments where I somewhat connected with my Chinese side, they were rare. When my family and I moved to the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hills, I wasnтАЩt worried whether I would stick out among my peers. By the age of six, I was very much American. All of my interests, at that point, were rooted in Western culture. Favorite superhero? Batman. Favorite sport? Basketball. Favorite band? *NSYNC (yes, you read that right). And all of that worked in my favor тАФ my knowledge of American pop culture was enough for me to find friends in an Israeli, a Colombian and two Dominicans. My parents were incessantly worried that IтАЩd lose touch with my identity as a Chinese American. In elementary school, they enrolled me in Chinese language classes and insisted that I speak Cantonese at home. My father refused to answer me if I couldnтАЩt ask him a question in Chinese. He would convince my mother to do the same. It irritated me тАФ I would walk away, curse under my breath and mope in my room. It made no sense that my parents had traveled thousands of miles to the U.S., given birth to me and expected me to not speak English around them. Over the next several years, I came to hate every single expectation my parents had of me. I didnтАЩt want to learn Chinese тАФ I didnтАЩt have that many Chinese friends to begin with, and it didnтАЩt help that there wasnтАЩt a Chinese American outside of my family that I could look up to. Every single time I turned on the television, the people I would watch were white. Every artist that my parents forced me to listen to in the car тАФ from the Eagles to Richard Marx тАФ were white. Every classical piano piece that my father told me to learn was written by a white composer. At a certain point, I was confused by the mixed messages my parents were sending. Did they want me to be American or did they want me to be Chinese? My refusal to appreciate my heritage, along with my knack for being a rebellious child, led to a lot of self-resentment. I would hide the lunch that my mother had made from my classmates because they would make an offhand remark about its smell. I would try to impress my peers by cracking a self-deflating joke, and I would look down at the floor when they, in turn, participated in the ridiculing. I would omit my Chinese middle name when filling out school forms. My attitude worsened when my parents decided to enroll me, then 12 years old, in a Catholic school in Chinatown. Most of the children were not only Chinese but had grown up with each other. They had come from a tight-knit community, where parents would shower them with a not-so-meager allowance or couple of expensive gifts as long as they behaved. Even though the students and I shared a common ethnic background, we never saw eye to eye. They would make fun of the hand-me-downs I wore and unabashedly engage in the Chinese mannerisms that we were often vilified for: spitting on the street, talking loudly, walking briskly around the neighborhood while unintentionally shoving people along the way. It was embarrassing at first, but the more I saw these different behaviors, the more I normalized them. Doing so, however, didnтАЩt really change my relationship with my classmates. I still got into fights. I still hated the fact that their parents could buy them North Face jackets and Nike Air Force Ones. I still could barely make out the Cantonese they spoke. Even though we all had yellow skin and slanted eyes, I didnтАЩt care about being in solidarity with them тАФ none of them had been exposed to other cultures that I, the тАЬall-AmericanтАЭ kid, had been fortunate enough to experience. In high school, I refused to join the Asian students club because every person in the group seemed to embody Asian stereotypes. Most were passive, endlessly talked about anime and played handball. They seemed quick to judge whenever they came across something that was taboo in Asian culture, whether it was smoking weed or openly talking about sex. They were too traditional for me, and they seemed to feed into the worst characteristics that made Asian Americans unattractive: emasculated, submissive and out-of-touch (I realize now that my impression of them was just as superficial as the labels I had wrongly reinforced upon them). I quickly found myself gravitating toward the Black students at the school, although my only exposure to Black culture was тАЬGet Rich or Die TryinтАЩтАЭ (a 50 Cent album that had been released just before my freshman year). Nonetheless, I was intrigued by how comfortable they appeared in their own skin and defied every single anti-Black stereotype that the Chinese community had peddled to me for years. It was through their acceptance and friendliness that I gained a sense of community in ways my own couldnтАЩt teach. Over those four years of high school, I immersed myself in Nas, Jay-Z, Memphis Bleek, Fabolous and The Diplomats. I paid attention to Black streetwear trends, even though I rarely had the money to afford brands like Rocawear and Phat Farm. I watched Black shows like тАЬThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,тАЭ тАЬFamily MattersтАЭ and тАЬ106 & Park,тАЭ almost religiously. By the end of my senior year, I had aligned myself more with Black culture than Chinese culture, to my parentsтАЩ disappointment. Even the few Chinese friends I had made during my time in Chinatown noticed that I was unnecessarily making jokes at myself to fit in a community that I didnтАЩt belong to. I reasoned the problem was that I had long lived in a country where almost everything тАФ from politics to entertainment тАФ was defined through a Black or white lens. Asian American culture simply didnтАЩt exist, and, in order to avoid being typecast as a foreigner, I had to find the next closest culture I could relate to. I didnтАЩt want to be laughed at like MAD TVтАЩs Bobby Lee, who more often than not played up stereotypes on the sketch comedy series. I didnтАЩt want to be called тАЬLing Ling,тАЭ as I had so often seen on TV or heard on the radio. I just wanted to be treated for who I was: a Chinese American who was a native New Yorker at his very core. Spending time with my Black friends led to a heightened appreciation of myself as a minority. Even though I wasnтАЩt Black, I saw how proud my Black friends were of their culture and how quick they were to put others in their place if an offensive comment was made. It forced me to reevaluate myself as a Chinese American and the pain my ignorance had brought on my parents over the years. In college, I took an Asian American literature course and spent almost every day reading about China. None of the news coverage I came across during that period was particularly positive, and, at times, it made me flat-out embarrassed to be Chinese. I didnтАЩt want to regularly read about the unfair trade practices, the sweatshop labor, the тАЬexoticтАЭ cuisine and the human rights violations that China was known for. Even my father, a proud Macanese American, would even make snide comments that seemed to validate why I spurned my Chinese side in the first place. Still, I pushed forward in my journey of finding myself as a Chinese American. I spent more time in Chinatown. I made a few more trips to Macau, where my relatives would often crack jokes at the fact that I was simply too American and argued that I needed to respect my heritage more. Yet, perhaps the most formative moment came when I experienced a racist altercation that was eerily similar to what many Asian Americans have to currently endure. One night in 2011, my father waited patiently for a car to pull out of a parking space in front of a Walgreens, when another driver, a white man, pulled into the space. Annoyed, my father rolled down his window to confront him and was promptly told to тАЬgo back to China.тАЭ I was incensed, and I could feel my heart beating faster and faster as I struggled to keep my mouth shut. I knew that my father was more American than anyone else. After all, who the hell was this white man to tell my father that he didnтАЩt belong in a country that was taken away from Native Americans, built on the backs of African American slaves and later became a nation of immigrants? I looked at my father, who remained stoic. It saddened me that, despite the tremendous battles he had gone through to successfully provide for himself and his family, he still had to come face-to-face with the fact he wasnтАЩt accepted in a country that he had lived in for over 20 years. The encounter was a chilling reminder that no matter how hard my family and I had tried to assimilate in the U.S., we would never be fully accepted. That episode is part of the reason why IтАЩm in journalism today. ItтАЩs also why IтАЩm so persistent in giving Asian Americans a voice they have long deserved. This country has conditioned us, as Asian Americans, to reject ourselves and take the Western perception of Asian culture at face value. It has propped us up as the тАЬmodel minority,тАЭ pitting us against the Black and Hispanic communities тАФ the very communities that helped give rise to the Asian American civil rights movement. It has minimized our struggles because we have been so cultured to put our heads down and follow the rules. When I graduated from Queens College with a degree in English and political science, my father insisted that I go straight to law school. It was the safe option and would lead to a financially stable career, he argued. As a 21-year-old, I knew better though. I had reached an age that required me to avoid constantly relying on my parents for guidance. I had to decide what was best for me, so I chose to devote my energy into carving out a space in the media for Asian Americans. Fortunately, in 2013, the millennial publication Mic put out a call for a columnist who could touch on Asian American issues. It was an opportune time for me: I had just completed my MasterтАЩs project on the lack of Asian American leads on Broadway as a Columbia Journalism School student and wanted to write more. In December of that same year, while writing for Mic, I explored whether Asian men were undateable тАФ an issue that has plagued East Asian men in the U.S. for decades. The article later caught the attention of Al Jazeera America, which invited me to speak on the definition of modern manhood. Prior to that appearance, I had never been on a major news network and had doubted whether I had actually made a difference with my columns on anti-Asian racism and the gentrification of Chinatown. But with that one brief time on air, I knew, then, that my voice actually mattered. The following year, I freelanced for the pop culture publication Complex, where I touched on the lack of Asian Americans in Hollywood. Ironically, several months later, in 2015, I was invited by MSNBC to discuss the importance of restaurateur Eddie HuangтАЩs ABC show тАЬFresh Off the Boat,тАЭ the first to feature an all-Asian television cast since ChoтАЩs тАЬAll-American Girl.тАЭ At the time, I was admittedly grateful that the media was giving my community the recognition that it deserved, and I couldnтАЩt help but think that I had made a contribution тАФ no matter how small or subtle it was тАФ to the empowerment of Asian Americans. I had leveraged the identity I once hid to shed light on an issue that not only affected myself but thousands around me. I had made an impact. The success of the box office hit тАЬCrazy Rich AsiansтАЭ three years later, in 2018, further confirmed that I had made the right choice in publicly advocating for my community. I couldnтАЩt contain my happiness as my parents sang along to the filmтАЩs Mandarin songs. Even my non-Asian friends raved about the movie and argued that films needed more Asian representation. For the first time in my life, I had never felt more respected as an Asian American. That feeling, however, seems fleeting nowadays. When the pandemic started to take shape in China in January, I immediately noticed the effects that it had at my home in New York. The once-bustling neighborhood of Chinatown suddenly turned quiet. Nobody seemingly wanted to support a business in the area. Every restaurant I passed by had, at most, five or six customers. The bars lacked a vibrant atmosphere. The supermarkets seemed fully stocked because of unnecessary fears over their Chinese goods. In my own neighborhood of Forest Hills, I learned that a Chinese father and his 10-year-old son were attacked by a stranger for not wearing a mask. It made me think twice about whether I should even step out of my apartment. Mask or not, I could potentially be assaulted for simply being Chinese, I figured. The reality is that these past several weeks amid a pandemic have been particularly trying. As a writer and one of the leads of my companyтАЩs Asian employee resource groups, I feel obligated to speak out against racism whenever I see it, although I worry about the attention it could bring. For a long time, my father has cautioned against my being too outspoken out of a concern for my safety. Just recently, one of my best friends from high school begged me to tone it down after I shared a story in which I had sent a lengthy email criticizing a Twitter user for posting a racist animation. тАЬWhy are you spending so much time on individuals like this?тАЭ my friend, whoтАЩs Jewish, wrote to me on Instagram. тАЬHalf the country is like this. YouтАЩre only gonna spend your own energy like that. Think bigger. YouтАЩre getting too small potatoes.тАЭ Nevertheless, in light of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, I feel more determined than ever to protect not only my community but my own identity as a Chinese American. As an advocate, I understand the responsibility that comes with that role. IтАЩve told myself time after time that I canтАЩt tackle the larger issue of anti-Asian discrimination without addressing the individual and more personal incidents that feed into it. The coronavirus hasnтАЩt made me ashamed to be Asian; it has done the exact opposite. When Chinatown shops suffered from a lack of business, I admired how quickly members of the Chinese community came together to ensure that those restaurants remained open. In March, for instance, Jennifer Tam, a senior communications manager at Foursquare, and Victoria Lee, a corporate travel and meetings strategist at the Est├йe Lauder Companies, launched Welcome to Chinatown, a grassroots initiative that feeds healthcare workers with meals provided by Chinatown eateries and funded by donors. After writing a story about Tam and LeeтАЩs effort to keep those businesses alive, I received a message from the founders thanking me for spreading the word. тАЬIf I had to guess, by the way, because of the reach of your piece, it helped us raise enough funds to feed at least an additional two hospitals this week,тАЭ one of them wrote. At that moment, I had never felt more accomplished. It was clear that I hadnтАЩt just effected change within my own community but also outside it. Since then, Welcome to Chinatown has sent out over 3,800 meals to those fighting the pandemic on the frontline and put back $33,000 into the neighborhood. The initiativeтАЩs recent success has reaffirmed the fact that the Asian American voice тАФ not just mine, TamтАЩs and LeeтАЩs тАФ carries just as much weight as those of the white, Black and Hispanic communities, that Asian Americans need to demand respect by reclaiming their identity and that the strength of the Asian American community is in its numbers. As I press on as both a journalist and activist, IтАЩm reminded of one short but powerful quote from Japanese American essayist Mitsuye Yamada that can be aptly applied to my experience as an Asian American thus far: тАЬTo finally recognize our own invisibility is to finally be on the path toward visibility. Invisibility is not a natural state for anyone.тАЭ Edited with the generous help of Maia McCann, Dillon Thompson and Amissa Pitter.

2987,"Latino, Asian American areas at high economic risk, according to new report","Click here to sign in with or Forget Password? Learn more share this! Share 2 Share Email April 7, 2020 by University of California, Los Angeles Neighborhoods with significant Latino and Asian American populations in Los Angeles County are particularly vulnerable to economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report sponsored by the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative (LPPI) and Center for Neighborhood Knowledge (CNK) at UCLA Luskin, along with Ong & Associates. ""Entire communities are in a precarious financial situation, weakening the economic base in areas that already have a history of underinvestment and limited opportunities,"" said Paul Ong, lead author and CNK director. According to the report, almost 60% of Latino-majority neighborhoods and 40% of Asian-majority neighborhoods will be affected; in comparison, 12% of white-majority neighborhoods will face the same level of economic disruption caused by the global pandemic. The report includes recommendations for state and local officials to support low-wage workers in Los Angeles County. ""Latinos and Asian Americans are critical to the continued success of Los Angeles County's economy, and the impact that their families and neighborhoods will see in this crisis requires urgent action,"" said Sonja Diaz, LPPI executive director. Communities that will see the greatest impacts include neighborhoods in northeast Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Valley, Inglewood and the northeast San Fernando Valley, the report found.

3110,Asian American woman harassed by self-identified Trump supporter thanks bystanders,"Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News A San Francisco resident who faced anti-Asian harassment while walking her dogs is speaking out, urging those who witness such xenophobia to step in to help. Amanda Law, 36, a master's student at San Francisco State University, said she was near the Great Highway last month when a woman approached her to ask why she wasn't staying home. Law told NBC Asian America that she recorded the incident for protection. In the video, the woman can be seen walking toward the camera, asking why Law тАЬdoesnтАЩt go back to where she came from,тАЭ as passersby stepped in and told the woman not to harass her. The video shows the woman continuing to walk toward the camera. тАЬAmericans said we donтАЩt want you here,тАЭ the woman said later in the video. тАЬThatтАЩs why we elected President Trump."" Law said at least five or six people intervened, and that she was grateful for it. тАЬI was like, тАШThank God.тАЩ Because I literally, at that point, I literally was cornered. I had nowhere to go,тАЭ she said. She also advocated for those who witness xenophobic harassment to intervene. тАЬBe aware this is happening, make sure you know how to handle it when it happens, and if you walk by and you see someone being harassed, step in because, you know, youтАЩre really going to help to save that person,тАЭ Law said. Asian Americans have reported an increased number of xenophobic attacks, both verbal and physical, in the wake of the coronavirus. Nonprofits and public officials have launched bias response lines for Asian Americans to report instances of xenophobia, and congressional leaders have condemned coronavirus-related racism. The San Francisco Police Department confirmed in an email that a police report was filed. In a statement, it said an unknown woman approached the victim and began yelling obscenities based on the victimтАЩs ethnicity. The department also said that while the obscenities yelled were ""abhorrent,"" it did not constitute a hate crime. Natasha Roy is an intern with NBC News Digital. ┬й 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",0,0,1,3
3122,Sen. Harris and Assemblymember Bonta: Standing up for the AAPI community amid America├втВмтДвs leadership crisis ├втВмтАЭ,"We are in a crisis тАФ one that requires unifying leadership. But thatтАЩs not what we are getting from the president of the United States. The staggering death toll and human suffering havenтАЩt changed Donald TrumpтАЩs lack of empathy and tendency to strike out at those who speak truth. Rather than show moral leadership and take real action to help people, Trump has resorted to race-baiting and spreading misinformation. This has helped perpetuate hate against the Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. After it became clear that President Trump ignored early warning signs and failed to prepare for this pandemic, he blamed other countries, groups of people, and entities like the World Health Organization. The racializing of the coronavirus as the тАЬChinese virusтАЭ and тАЬWuhan virusтАЭ by the president and by some members of Congress has recklessly put members of the AAPI community at risk. The number of hate-fueled incidents тАУ ranging from verbal harassment to physical assault тАУ against the AAPI community remains dangerous. These incidents include cases like people being spit on, having bottles thrown at them, and being physically assaulted in the subway and other public places. The racist fearmongering has also hurt AAPI-owned small businesses. It was reported that Asian American businesses saw up to an 80% drop in business before isolation orders came into full effect. Not only has this scapegoating caused members of the AAPI community to fear for their safety, but also their livelihoods. Sadly, weтАЩve seen this kind of prejudice before. Two decades after the Chinese Exclusion Act, the federal government blamed Chinese Americans for an outbreak of the bubonic plague in San Francisco. We must work to make sure history doesnтАЩt continue repeating itself. The increase in instances of profiling, intolerance, intimidation, and hate is disturbing and inexcusable. Any witness to these acts has the responsibility to speak up, report, and condemn them. And the Commander in Chief must show real leadership that unifies our country instead of sowing hate, especially during a national crisis. Given the lack of leadership in the White House, the two of us have worked hard to address these issues head-on by demanding an end to discrimination against the AAPI community; calling for the administration to address bias; and requesting funding to combat discrimination. During this Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, we must recognize that there is more that unites us than divides us. ItтАЩs natural to be fearful or anxious in these uncertain times, but we cannot allow that fear to erode our unity. While there have been despicable acts of hatred, there are countless examples of communities supporting one another. People helping their elderly neighbors with groceries, impromptu balcony concerts for frontline workers, and wellness check-ins over video calls have become essential to our resilience. Stories like these serve as hopeful reminders that we are all better off when we reject hatred, look out for others, and embrace our shared humanity. Kamala Harris is a U.S. Senator representing California. Rob Bonta is a State Assemblymember representing Oakland, Alameda, and San Leandro.┬а Please, advocate for the vunerable population.

3128,Violence Against Asian Americans Is on the Rise├втВмтАЭBut It├втВмтДвs Part of a Long History,"In New York, a woman was attacked by three teenage girls while riding the bus. In California, a high schooler was beaten up and sent to the hospital. In Texas, a family of three was stabbed by a man who thought they were тАЬChinese and infecting people with the coronavirus.тАЭ As COVID-19 has spread across the U.S. and around the world after first being identified in Wuhan, China, so have attacks against Asians and Asian Americans. In March, the FBI warned that there could be a surge in in hate crimes against Asian Americans, and data has reflected this: in New York, all 15 coronavirus-related hate crimes investigated by the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force have been directed at Asian victims, according to NYPD detective Annette Shelton. Nationwide, one advocacy group has collected more than 1,200 reports of racist attacks against Asian Americans since the start of the outbreak. But this wave of attacks is far from a new development. Asian Americans, a new docuseries that arrives on PBS on May 11, traces this history all the way back to the 19th century, when mobs committed mass murder on Chinese immigrants on the West Coast. Since then, Asian Americans, commonly thought of as an upwardly mobile model minority, have often been violently scapegoated for larger societal issues, with their attackers only vindicated or protected by institutional forces. тАЬThis will be one of the major storylines that viewers are going to be surprised and even shocked by,тАЭ Erika Lee, a historian who appears in the series, tells TIME. Asian Americans covers many aspects of history, from college campus protests to the rise of cultural icons like Anna May Wong and Margaret Cho. But its segments about prejudiced violence have particular resonance in this moment. Lee and producer Renee Tajima-Pe├▒a hope that the series will put the current attacks into perspective. тАЬYou see these fault lines of racism and xenophobia in relation to immigrants that have always been there,тАЭ Tajima-Pe├▒a tells TIME. тАЬIn times of crisis, they erupt. They erupted during World War II; they erupted after 9/11. And theyтАЩre erupting now.тАЭ Below is a brief history of some of the most notable, yet often overlooked, incidents of racist attacks toward Asian AmericansтАФand a path forward as the current pandemic incites violence anew. In the mid-1800s, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants came to the United States seeking the тАЬGold MountainтАЭ of California. But instead of finding riches, many of them became hard laborers on the transcontinental railroad, blasting through the Sierra Nevada under brutal working conditions. When the railroad was finished in 1869, many workers settled in Chinatowns on the West Coast, becoming farmers, fishermen, launderers or domestic servants. But while the immigrants might have been initially accepted as cheap laborers, they were abhorred as they formed their own communities, especially as a deep recession sunk in beginning in 1873. тАЬAsians were seen as bringing unfair labor competition, vice, disease,тАЭ Tajima-Pe├▒a says. Racially-charged language soon dominated tabloids, cartoons, town halls and the speeches of politicians, who used anti-Chinese rhetoric as an easy way to curry favor with voters. Horace Greeley, a prominent political figure and the founder of the New-York Tribune, labeled Chinese-Americans as тАЬuncivilized, unclean, and filthy beyond all conception without any of the higher domestic or social relations.тАЭ This type of language boiled over into deathly violence time and time again. In 1871, at least seventeen Chinese immigrants were hanged in makeshift gallows by a large white mob in Chinatown in Los Angeles. In 1885, an armed mob forcibly drove a Chinese population out of its Tacoma, Wash. homes, menacing its community with rifles, breaking into houses and smashing doors and windows. The same year, white workers in Wyoming massacred 28 Chinese coal miners. In each instance, these vicious attacks did not result in increased protections for Asian Americans, but further institutional debasement. In Tacoma, the cityтАЩs mayor, Jacob Weisbach, participated himself; in Los Angeles, the manslaughter convictions of eight men were ultimately overturned on a legal technicality. In 1882, the widespread anti-Chinese sentiment was burnished into law with the Chinese Exclusion Act, marking the first time the U.S. had ever barred a specific ethnic group from immigrating to the country. Angry white attackers used plenty of excuses for their violenceтАФincluding economic and sexual fearsтАФbut perhaps the most frequent type of rhetoric was medically based. тАЬIt goes back to the notions of China being a place of billions of people living together with unsanitary health habits and strange eating customs that mark them as uncivilized in comparison to the West,тАЭ Lee says. When a smallpox outbreak hit San Francisco in 1875, the cityтАЩs health officer blamed тАЬunscrupulous, lying and treacherous Chinamen, who have disregarded our sanitary laws.тАЭ Every house in Chinatown was forcibly fumigated, but the epidemic spread unabated. In 1900, the bubonic plague broke out in Honolulu. In response, the Board of Health set fire to 41 buildings in the cityтАЩs Chinatown, forcing its residents into quarantined detention camps. In Santa Ana, Calif., six years later, the City Council, citing a man who allegedly contracted leprosy, decided to burn down its own Chinatown. A thousand local residents gathered nearby to watch the conflagration, while the fire department stood by in case the adjacent buildings needed protection. On Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, the main immigration checkpoint on the West Coast, prospective immigrants were subjected to humiliating and invasive medical examinations and held for weeks in its detention center before they either entered the country or were deported. тАЬExisting racial ideas got medicalizedтАФand transferred into public health narrative and then policies,тАЭ Lee says. Over the past century, similar waves of attacks have flared up in times of economic or public health-based anxiety. These attacks have often been followed by institutional reinforcement, and have been buoyed by national policy which has consistently framed Asian faces as enemies of war. In 1929, as the Great Depression set in, a California mob of hundreds of white men stormed a Filipino working class community in Watsonville, firing into a bunkhouse and killing the 22-year-old Fermin Tobera. This was three decades after the Filipino-American War, during and after which Filipinos were made out in the press to be unclean and unworthy of self-rule. No one was charged with ToberaтАЩs murder; seven men were convicted of rioting but received only probation or 30 days in jail. In fact, Filipinos bore the brunt of what came to be known as the Watsonville riots: the California Athletic Commission placed a ban on Filipino boxers, saying their appearance would incite crowd violence, and in 1933, California enacted an amendment to a state law that prohibited marriages between Filipinos and whites. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans were immediately arrested and detained without due process. Two months later, 120,000 people of Japanese descent were rounded up and taken to incarceration camps. A generation later, anti-Asian racism spiked after the Vietnam WarтАФincluding in one immigrant fishing village in Texas, where Vietnamese refugees were driven out by the Ku Klux Klan, who set fire to their houses and boats and hung a shrimper in effigy. In 1982, the 28-year-old Chinese-American Vincent Chin was beaten to death by two white auto workers in Detroit who assumed he was Japanese and blamed him for the decline of the auto industry. (Following an oil crisis, consumers began opting for more fuel-efficient Japanese imports over American cars.) The murderers ended up serving three years probation but no jail time, thanks to intervention from Judge Charles Kaufman, who wrote, тАЬThese werenтАЩt the kind of men you send to jail.тАЭ And following 9/11, the Sikh Coalition documented over 300 cases of violence and discrimination against Sikh Americans throughout the United States. тАЬWhen you see it across history, it begs the question of whether we should characterize them as unrelated episodes, or as something thatтАЩs more endemic to American history,тАЭ Lee says. Vincent ChinтАЩs death was a pivotal turning point for Asian-American consciousness. It forced many to reconsider the myth of the model minorityтАФthat Asian Americans could fully integrate by simply working hard and keeping their heads downтАФand showed that people of different Asian ethnicities were inextricably linked whether they liked it or not. Following Judge KaufmanтАЩs decision, a movement of solidarity and activism emerged that still persists today. But many Americans still arenтАЩt aware of ChinтАЩs murder or assume itтАЩs a relic of history, especially given the outward-facing success of many Asian Americans in recent years in fields like medicine and computer science. тАЬMost of the time we were producing the series, it was kind of relative peace and prosperity for a lot of Asian Americans,тАЭ Tajima-Pe├▒a said. тАЬWe knew that from looking at the history, that could end very fast.тАЭ тАЬWhen I think about how easily this has happenedтАФhow immediate and global the anti-Chinese racism has beenтАФit reveals to me the enduring strength of those stereotypes and narratives across centuries,тАЭ Lee says. Tajima-Pe├▒a thinks things could get a lot worse, especially given President TrumpтАЩs framing of the disease as foreign and his usage of the term тАЬChinese virus,тАЭ which mimics centuries of damaging rhetoric that preceded sweeping violence. тАЬThe Trump administration has decided China will be the boogieman in the coronavirus crisis. ThatтАЩs going to affect all of us as Asian Americans. And especially when the economic crisis collides with the racialization of the disease, thatтАЩs going to be ugly,тАЭ she says. She says the way forward is to learn from these harrowing histories and mobilize through civil and political action. Some organizational steps have already been taken: a new tool created by California-based advocacy organizations has been widely used to monitor hate incidents, and New York congresswoman Grace Meng has introduced legislation that seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes. And just as the killing of Vincent Chin expanded a Japanese-American problem into an Asian-American one, Tajima-Pe├▒a hopes that the current COVID-19 crisis will force people to тАЬkeep on broadening the circles of solidarity outside our own groups.тАЭ She hopes that Asian Americans will not turn inward, but use this moment as an impetus to empathize with and support other marginalized communities. тАЬAsian Americans need to stop invoking Vincent ChinтАЩs name if they ignore the Ahmaud Arberys that happen on and off camera on a weekly or even daily basis,тАЭ she says, referring to the black man who was shot to death while on a run in Georgia in February. тАЬWe have to figure out how to work together.тАЭ Britney Spears showed off her back -- sans a shirt -- in a photo shared on Instagram on Wednesday.

3157,Bay Area woman arrested after racist notes targeting Asian Americans were posted at homes,"KTLA by: Associated Press A woman in the San Francisco Bay Area has been arrested on suspicion of posting handwritten messages at several homes, targeting Asian Americans and suggesting that those not native to the United States should leave the country immediately. Police in San Leandro, a suburb of 89,000 just south of Oakland, said officers were called to the Heron Bay neighborhood Friday evening after receiving reports of notes containing тАЬinsensitive messages towards minoritiesтАЭ taped to five homes. тАЬIf you are a woman or man and was born in other country, return, go back to your land immediately, fast, with urgency,тАЭ the note said. It ended with тАЬOne American, white, brave, that serves the Nation or USA is going to live here.тАЭ One resident gave the officers images captured on his doorbell security camera of a woman taping the note, and the officers soon found her in the area, police said in a statement. Nancy Arechiga, 52, was carrying a backpack containing copies of the same notes, the statement said. She was arrested тАЬfor these inappropriate messages that instilled fear and intimidation upon those residents.тАЭ тАЬWe welcome peopleтАЩs rights to express themselves, but not in a manner that infringes upon a communityтАЩs sense of security and well-being,тАЭ Lt. Isaac Benabou said. Arechiga was taken to Alameda County jail and booked for investigation of committing a hate crime. She was issued a citation and released from custody, another police official, Lt. Ted Henderson, said. California has set bail at $0 for low-level crimes and misdemeanors in an effort to keep jails empty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Arechiga was told to appear in court, though the date hasnтАЩt been set because of the holiday weekend, he said. It wasnтАЩt known whether she has retained a lawyer. A phone number listed for Arechiga has been disconnected. Police were also investigating whether Arechiga was responsible for a similar note found Thursday on a local trail.

3169,Asian American Activists to Watch | PBS SoCal,"Individuals of Asian descent may currently represent less than 6% of the American population, but history has shown that it just takes one individual to launch a revolution. There was outspoken writer and critic Wong Chin Foo countering racist perceptions of Chinese by publishing the newspaper Chinese American in 1883 in New York City, labor organizer Larry Itliong leading the farmworker strikes in Delano, California in 1965, and National Domestic Workers Alliance cofounder Ai-jen Poon helping make the Domestic Worker Bills of Rights a reality today in nine states. And thanks to individuals like Phil Yu and the team of the blog Angry Asian Man and other Asian American news-oriented outlets, we now have a constant stream of stories bringing attention to the injustices against and triumphs of the Asian American community. Watch ""Asian Americans,"" a five-hour film series that delivers a bold, fresh perspective on the history of the fastest-growing demographic in the country today. Stream now. We are witnessing and benefiting from such might in ways that are historic. In dire circumstances such as this COVID-19 pandemic, many have been compelled into action: Asian American food businesses organizing meals for healthcare workers and elderly communities; manicurists, students and designers producing personal protective equipment for front liners; and even elementary school children and their grandparents marching side by side with posters in hand to support their teachers, protest gun violence and demand an end to family separation at the border. The following California-based Asian American activists are just a snapshot of the beautiful tapestry woven by thousands of individuals across the country enacting change in remarkable ways. As a performance artist, comedian and writer, Kristina Wong has long entertained audiences with her no-holds-barred shows, social posts and videos, bringing attention to anti-Asian racism, campaigning for (and succeeding in acquiring) essential services for the homeless as elected representative of Los AngelesтАЩs Koreatown. She now leads more than 600 тАЬsweatshopтАЭ volunteers known as the Auntie Sewing Squad to make and distribute thousands of homemade masks to COVID-19 front liners and vulnerable populations.┬а But there was one particular project for which Wong received endless praise from parents and, unexpectedly, scathing criticism and death threats from right-wing media for its content: тАЬRadical Cram School,тАЭ an award-winning digital series featuring lessons and conversations with Asian American youth as young as six years old to explore Asian American history and identity тАФ lessons sorely absent from school curriculum and even in our own households. Directed by Jenessa Joffe, and produced by Anna Michelle Wang and Theodore Chao, the series was born out of the desire to educate kids about what it means to be an тАЬempowered Asian American woman,тАЭ says the artist. There are many laughs to be had in тАЬRadical Cram School,тАЭ but more importantly, an infectious call to action for kids to challenge the status quo and to fight injustices of all forms, fueled by very personal stories (from Wong and the kids) and often concrete data. In the first seasonтАЩs тАЬ#4 StatisticsтАЭ episode, тАЬAuntie KristinaтАЭ distributes different-sized chocolate-chip cookies to her class to demonstrate how specific groups are paid differently than men for the same work. In the fourth episode of the second season, they also memorably depict the plight of undocumented workers in America through a humans-versus-puppets conflict on a public playground. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDKGYeZ9AhY The showтАЩs 12 episodes have collectively more than 200,000 views, with each episode generally running 3 minutes, with not a second wasted. Wong knows very well that any time an Asian American speaks onscreen is a powerful act in itself: тАЬWhen I was a kid, there would occasionally be one token Asian kid in a classroom scene with no lines, and IтАЩd stare and stare and wait for them to say something,тАЭ she recalls. тАЬTo me, тАШRadical Cram SchoolтАЩ was a moment where Asian American kids, mostly girls, could see themselves as the center of the story and understand how they can be allies to social justice movements. I think that social movements in America havenтАЩt documented the contributions of Asian Americans тАж I want to shift that.тАЭ┬а Founded in 2011 by South Asian American activists, the Bay Area Solidarity Summer (BASS) program draws South Asian American youth aged 18 to 24 for five days of training in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program aims to strengthen its participantsтАЩ organizing skills to advocate for social justice and learn about the history of South Asian activism in the United States. More than 250 youth have participated in the program that is currently led by progressive activists Shams-Tabraiz Muzaffar, Palvinder Kaur, Anu Mandavilli, Anirvan Chatterjee and Asha Mehta. Recent participants are already making waves: Aditi Shakkarwar (2014) campaigned for sex education inclusive of LGBTQ students at Cupertino schools; Robin Gurung (2016), who came to the U.S. as a refugee, cofounded Asian Refugees United, which serves East Oakland Asian immigrant and refugee communities; and Muslim American activist Haleema Bharoocha (2019) started South Asians for Black Lives. тАЬBASS happened partly because [of] the founders growing up in this country asking questions about social justice. They did not have that space to talk about it,тАЭ says Mandavilli, who presented her work on environmental justice during the programтАЩs debut year. She joined the core team a few years later. тАЬIf you were a young person interested in science or engineering, youтАЩd have many people to speak to your age. However, if you are thinking about issues of representation or justice, more broadly тАФ whatтАЩs your place in your society, what is your relationship to other communities of color in the U.S. тАФ there were not that many places that can take your questions.тАЭ The volunteer-staffed program took inspiration from an earlier program for South Asian youth in New York, Youth Solidarity Summer, which two of the original BASS founders attended, as well as from initiatives by other communities of color. Past curriculum has included exploring Black and Brown solidarity, food justice workshops and fighting Islamophobia. BASS also hosts events geared toward community building, such as talent shows and mixers with alumni and South Asian American activists. тАЬYear after year, the youth absolutely love that aspect of it. They stay up late into the night talking,тАЭ shares Mandavilli. тАЬTheyтАЩre all so happy to talk to each other, to find each other. TheyтАЩre so hungry for that community of other South Asians who are interested in social justice.тАЭ┬а Reanne Estrada has long used art to bring attention to challenges affecting specific communities тАФ and actively invited others to do the same. SheтАЩs a member of the artist girl gang Mail Order Brides/M.O.B. and regularly collaborates with artist C. Ree. She recently developed an audio walking tour of the security cameras at the USC Pacific Asia Museum to explore privacy of our digital bodies. As co-founder of the L.A. creative studio for civic engagement, Public Matters, her team also tackles major factors affecting our everyday lives while employing creative, community-driven approaches to activism тАЬrooted in conspiratorial joy and collaboration,тАЭ which, Estrada describes, is very much in line with her own polydisciplinary practice that includes тАЬmaking things and acting out.тАЭ┬а тАЬPublic Matters is interested in making a case for arts and creativity to make change happen in other disciplines, and that they are integral, not incidental, to social change,тАЭ shares the artist, who also serves as the studioтАЩs creative director. тАЬWe attempt to bring imagination, humor and disarming approachability to seemingly intractable social issues like healthy food access (Market Makeovers), tobacco control and prevention (The Truth About Flavor), park access (Pedal2Parks)and traffic safety (Slow Jams).тАЭ Each of these projects involved developing close relationships with community members in the neighborhoods they took place in. For instance, the safer-streets project Slow Jams was launched in 2017 on Temple Street in Historic Filipinotown and Echo Park. Residents took to the streets with large signage, carrying colorful parasols, painting vibrant murals and manning educational booths to help advance the cityтАЩs Vision Zero Initiative through LADOT, which aims to protect peopleтАЩs lives on our city streets. тАЬTraffic safety, as an issue, pedestrian safety, mobility justice, that impacts a lot of different communities,тАЭ says Estrada. Together with partners that included Pilipino Workers Center, Los Angeles Walks, and for 2017, Gabba Gallery, Public Matters created an тАЬengagement ecosystemтАЭ of local residents, small businesses, community-based organizations, senior centers, schools, a parent network, elected officials and LADOT. This is but one example of the many incredible ecosystems that are made possible each year by Estrada and Public Matters. тАЬA lot of communities of color are proportionally impacted by traffic safety, so there are ways which the work we are doing, that we are seeding, in this context can then be translated into other contexts with other communities.тАЭ┬а When digital strategist William Yu launched the viral social media campaign #StarringJohnCho in 2016, he used Photoshop to replace white male leads in Hollywood-blockbuster movie posters with the Korean American actor Cho. Yu wanted to both critique the whitewashing of Asian characters in the industry and for the public to instantly visualize a world where Asians represented more than 1% of Hollywood lead roles.┬а тАЬEvery time I would broach the conversation of Asian American leads in Hollywood, it would always end with everyone throwing their hands up and saying some version of, тАШI just canтАЩt see it,тАЩтАЭ shares Yu. тАЬThe conversation couldnтАЩt progress because we would consistently be stuck in the hypothetical. I needed a counter. With #StarringJohnCho, I wanted to give people a very tangible, physical piece of evidence to demonstrate that this imaginary thing we were discussing could easily become a reality.тАЭ The global attention his campaign received has led Yu to speak about the lack of Asian American representation in Hollywood at various schools, film festivals and conferences. тАЬWhat I am very grateful for is the fact that the conversation around Asian American representation, from a visual perspective, has now become table stakes,тАЭ he adds. тАЬNo one has to put on their imagination caps and envision it. Now, we get to talk about the complexities of our stories, the depth and breadth of our experiences, and the inclusivity and intersectionality we want for our community.тАЭ HeтАЩs also since moved from advertising to become a screenwriter in Hollywood. тАЬAt the core of all this change is an urgent need to not just critique the culture I live in, but to take up space and participate in its growth.тАЭ┬а Through her webinars on transformative justice, public speeches and panels on disability justice, and compelling and insightful posts on her Leaving Evidence blog тАФ with topics ranging from тАЬForced Intimacy: An Ableist NormтАЭ to her video post тАЬRecognizing Each Other: Adoptees of ColorsтАЭ тАФ writer, educator and organizer Mia Mingus brings a very personal perspective on issues not often covered in mainstream media. Such work led the activist to be honored by the White House in 2013 as a Champion of Change for her work as an Asian American Pacific Islander leader. Working with the Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective (BATJC) for the past seven years, Mingus is part of a passionate community building and supporting transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse. тАЬTransformative justice pushes us to not fall back on punishment, revenge and criminalization, even when we are hurt or wronged and especially when we have hurt or wronged someone else,тАЭ Mingus says. тАЬIt asks us to imagine what justice тАФ true justice тАФ is, without being defined by the courts. It requires us to build relationships that are strong enough to be able to withstand mistakes, heartbreak, hurt, gossip, fear and trauma.тАЭ While many cite her as an important voice fighting injustices in various arenas тАФ evidenced by her thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter, Mingus celebrates how othersтАЩ activism powers her work each day. тАЬI am endlessly inspired by the ways everyday people and communities create the world they long for, even in small ways: communities growing their own food and feeding each other, forming care networks, transformative justice, community barter and trade economies built through relationships,тАЭ shares Mingus, who is especially invested in creating spaces where disabled youth can flourish. тАЬOne thing that inspires me to move forward is thinking about future generations of disabled children and the kind of world they would need to be able to be safe, loved and belong.тАЭStream all episodes of ""Asian Americans.""

3186,"21 Book, TV, Film And Podcast Suggestions For Asian Americans, By Asian Americans","ItтАЩs a difficult moment for Asian Americans: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, people in AAPI communities have been widely scapegoated for the virus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China. The online reporting forum Stop AAPI Hate said that since its inception on March 18, itтАЩs received more than 1,500 reports of discrimination primarily targeting Asian Americans. Given everything thatтАЩs going on, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month couldnтАЩt be better timed. To mark APAHM this year, we asked artists, writers and other creators of Asian descent to share one thing theyтАЩre currently reading, listening to or watching to counter all the negativity. Their recommendations include everything from a sprawling five-part PBS documentary series on the Asian American experience to a graphic novel by Gene Luen Yang in which Superman absolutely pummels the Ku Klux Klan. See all their recs below. Responses have been edited for style and clarity. тАЬAs a food and beverage professional, I immediately missed working with hospitality and flavor on a daily basis when social distancing began. One of the first things I watched when I couldnтАЩt work every day was David ChangтАЩs тАШUgly DeliciousтАЩ series on Netflix. Watching this show helped with the loss of my professional identity in my day to day, but it also brought me so much more hope and joy than I expected. At the heart of this travel/food documentary series is the idea that all cultures are more similar than we expect and that we can all connect with food. In a time when I was feeling alienated because of my cultural identity, remembering that every culture has their version of a dumpling gave me a sense of inclusion. While watching the first episode of season two, тАШKids Menu,тАЩ I sat in my living room crying. Partially because I needed a release from all the stress, but mostly because the stories of parents succeeding in their careers and having families despite how difficult it is to juggle both in our industry gave me so much hope. Seeing another first-generation Asian American use their love of food and culture to have an incredible career and beautiful family has helped motivate me to use this time to move toward the life I want on the other side of this.тАЭ тАХ Caer Maiko, bartender and co-owner of Daijoubu Pop Up A post shared by UglyDelicious (@uglydelicious) on Jun 21, 2018 at 1:19pm PDT тАЬI love episode six, тАШThe Grand Prize Expo Winners,тАЩ of the series тАШLittle AmericaтАЩ on Apple TV+. Written and produced by Tze Chun and starring Angela Lin, Chun tells the real-life story of how his single mom would stop at nothing to win her family a vacation. This episode evoked every feeling from ridiculous laughter to heartbreaking sadness. As the daughter of immigrants myself, I found the storytelling so reminiscent of my own first-generation upbringing, and perhaps, an important reminder that our immigrant parents are more than Mom or Dad, they are also real people who have overcome many struggles of their own.тАЭ тАХ Therese Mascardo, a psychologist and founder of Exploring Therapy тАЬThe most life-giving content IтАЩm consuming is the documentary series тАШAsian AmericansтАЩ on PBS. Watching the episodes made me bawl in a good way. My heart swelled with pride in seeing all of the contributions by Asian Americans: from Patsy Mink as the first woman of color to be elected to the national legislature, to Tereza Lee as the first тАШDreamer.тАЩ You can watch me in episode one gushing over Anna May Wong and Sessue Hayakawa, the first Asian superstars in Hollywood. This is the perfect content for our current times, reminding us that we have always overcome obstacles, resisted unjust laws, and served as leaders in this country.тАЭ тАХ Nancy Wang Yuen, sociologist and author of тАЬReel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and RacismтАЭ A post shared by CAAM (@caamedia) on May 11, 2020 at 3:29pm PDT тАЬI recommend this short film from 2017 by LA-based filmmakers Jeannie Nguyen and Andrew Yuyi Truong. This film is an aesthetic experiment of nostalgia and narrative. The film points to how young people navigate pressures of cultural identity and beauty expectations in the 1990s, yet its themes still resonate so deeply today. As a historian of Vietnam and filmmaker myself, I deeply appreciate how тАШFirst GenerationтАЩ pushes the boundaries of Vietnamese narrative and representation beyond generalizations about the war. The visual and sonic elements of the film transport me back to explore a formative and difficult time of youthful self-discovery and identity formation. The creators are examples of an exciting new generation of Vietnamese American/trans-Pacific artists speaking to fresh and profound themes related to Vietnam, its diasporas and beyond. Overall, this innovative film gives me a playful sense of hope and excitement for future of Asian American film, literature, and arts!тАЭ тАХ Cindy Nguyen, filmmaker and historian at Brown University тАЬThis three-part graphic novel tweezes out the nuances of Asian American identity with painfully close understanding. The first part is a retelling of the Monkey King legend, the second is about an ABC boy named Jin who moves to a white suburb, and the third, drawn in the style of a TV sitcom, is about a white boy named Danny whoтАЩs deeply ashamed of his Chinese cousin тАШChin-Kee,тАЩ who displays many racist stereotypes of Chinese people. Without giving away how all three storylines eventually converge, the price of JinтАЩs assimilation into his white community is rejecting his racial identity. ItтАЩs only through embracing being Asian American that Jin can reach freedom. Growing up in a predominantly white town, тАШAmerican Born ChineseтАЩ made me feel a little less alone in my experiences. Now itтАЩs a topical reminder that Asian American assimilation has always been conditional. It may not exactly be a comfort read, but тАШAmerican Born ChineseтАЩ is a story about what weтАЩre fighting for when we say weтАЩre fighting racism: ItтАЩs the right to be able to exist without fear or stereotypes, to declare and reclaim the terms of our own existences. In short, weтАЩre fighting for our own humanity.тАЭ тАХ Ashley Wong, an incoming AAPI issues reporter for The Sacramento Bee A post shared by A Midsummer Night's Read (@midsummerreads) on May 4, 2020 at 6:10am PDT тАЬMy mom has always expressed her love, not through words lost in translation, but through food, whether through her Cantonese steamed fish with ginger and scallions, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce or soy sauce chicken. So, while distancing from Mom, when not getting takeout to support Chinatown restaurants, IтАЩm learning my momтАЩs dishes. I remembered watching Martin Yan as a kid on PBS and whipped out his old-school тАШThe Yan Can Cook BookтАЩ to make those spare ribs. And I picked up тАШWisdom of the Chinese KitchenтАЩ by Grace Young, a chef whoтАЩs been chronicling Chinatown coronavirus stories, then picked up a whole fish from a still-open Chinatown seafood market and figured out, with GraceтАЩs help, how my mom would make that fish. Last week, Mom came to Chinatown for her monthly trip to the Chinese pharmacy, bringing compliments on my WeChat fish photo and multiple containers of her soy sauce chicken. And I knew sheтАЩd always be with me.тАЭ тАХ Annie Tan, teacher and activist тАЬWhen my daughter was a few months old, a good friend sent us the book тАШBabiesтАЩ by Gyo Fujikawa, an Asian American illustrator and writer, though in her lifetime and to her frustration, she was often misidentified as Japanese. My husband and I were captivated by her book as much as our daughter, and we fell down a rabbit hole of researching FujikawaтАЩs life and collecting her work. When тАШBabiesтАЩ was published in 1963, it was one of the first childrenтАЩs books to feature people of different races playing together, just existing together. It was FujikawaтАЩs first time authoring and illustrating a book, but still, she dared to battle with her publisher when they said it wouldnтАЩt sell well in the South. The book became a bestseller. Much of her work that followed depicts our multicultural, multiracial world. In the weeks since weтАЩve all been confined to home, IтАЩve found myself reaching for тАШOh!, What A Busy Day!тАЩ (1976) at bedtime. It is a book about the simple joys of childhood and the beauty of the day to day. Its pages and words remind both me and my daughter that the world is a big place, even when work, rain, or illness keeps us inside, and that there is room here for all of us.тАЭ тАХ Tienlon Ho, writer and co-author of the forthcoming Mister JiuтАЩs cookbook тАЬPost 2016 elections, Grace Lee BoggsтАЩ autobiography reminded me that this country has overcome many dark times, and in dark times, unlikely community heroes are born. Now, her wisdom and partnership with Jimmy Boggs remind me that only in community and only in caring for the most vulnerable of us will we get through the fire. And when physical contact and connection are at an all-time low, I find solace in the hope that one day I will find my Jimmy, my partner-for-change.тАЭ тАХ Nancy Ma, actress and writer тАЬIn the face of pervasive forms of xenophobia and anti-Asian racism (some of which were directed at me personally), this book helped me think through how major some of my seemingly тАШminor feelingsтАЩ are about being Asian American in this moment. Hong provided me a vocabulary for making sense of my rage, my depression, my loss. Hong theorizes from her personal experience the often unspoken affective experience of being racialized in the U.S. and ties it to an urgent critique of the myths of American exceptionalism and the тАШAmerican dream.тАЩ This dream, and the model minority myth that sustains it, is what Lauren Berlant has called тАШcruel optimismтАЩ: a hopeful desire for something that in turn harms us. Hong reveals how cruel that optimism really is, especially in our pandemic moment.тАЭ тАХ Travis Chi Wing Lau, assistant professor of English at Kenyon College A post shared by Angie (@sparksinwords) on Feb 25, 2020 at 12:51pm PST тАЬIтАЩm finding this book a helpful antidote to the confusion so prevalent these days when people argue over difficult topics. With humor, verve, and a knack for making complex ideas accessible, Cheng shines a light on the role and the limitations of logic, and how to use logic, together with emotion, well.тАЭ тАХ Francis Su, author of тАЬMathematics for Human Flourishing.тАЭ тАЬThis comic was inspired by a 1940s radio serial which pit Superman against the тАЬClan of the Fiery Cross,тАЭ a fictional stand-in for the KKK. Yang ingeniously draws a metaphor between SupermanтАЩs early pre-flying/heat vision incarnation and the assimilation foisted upon immigrants. The Asian American Lee family featured in YangтАЩs story are charming and their family dynamic moved me numerous times throughout the book. Of course, itтАЩs therapeutic to witness the power fantasy of Superman smashing white supremacists.тАЭ тАХ Jeremy Arambulo, illustrator and author of the graphic novel тАЬA ChallengeтАЭ A post shared by @nerdrage76 on Feb 1, 2020 at 10:29am PST тАЬSaujani teaches women to be brave in what they do and shed the notion of being perfect as society has taught. It was very refreshing to read a book by a fellow Asian woman and entrepreneur. The themes of fearing less, failing more, and living bolder are consistent throughout her book and were relevant to my decision in taking the leap of faith, leaving my corporate job, and, thus, being the founder of a dress shirt company at a time when everyone is work-from-home. The fear of failure is overwhelming as a small business owner and a first-time founder in an unconventional career path as a first-generation Asian American, and her book really showed that by choosing bravery over perfection, I have agency over my voice and what I wanted to accomplish: more size inclusion and AAPI representation in fashion.тАЭ тАХ Tanya Zhang, the co-founder of Nimble Made, a slim-fit dress shirt company тАЬThis is a graphic novel about the Vietnamese refugee experience and coming to America for a new life. This book is reassuring to me during these difficult times because it reminds me of the strength and resilience of the Vietnamese people. My parents and their generation lived through unimaginable suffering and challenges in order to come to America for a better life; if they can live through that, then we can live through the COVID-19 pandemic.тАЭ тАХ Cindy Trinh, photographer and visual journalist A post shared by Thi Bui (@teabuoy) on Apr 15, 2019 at 9:19am PDT тАЬI recommend the novel тАШThe Sweetest FruitsтАЩ by Monique Truong. ItтАЩs a captivating work of historical fiction that flung me into three very different places in time around the world, as told through three female characters who are each constrained in some ways by their society. It made me feel a bit grateful and empowered because of that, of course. But more than that, so impressed with TruongтАЩs ability to write in such disparate voices and bring together a really original novel. I gave the book to my dad afterward, and he read it swiftly and also remarked at what inspired storytelling it was.тАЭ тАХ Cathy Erway, journalist and author of тАЬThe Art of Eating InтАЭ тАЬIтАЩve been thinking a lot about filial piety and my experience as a Chinese daughter and an American mother. To be honest, my days are so overwhelmed with eldercare and other chores that I havenтАЩt read much, but before bedtime, IтАЩve been listening to the audiobook of Maxine Hong KingstonтАЩs classic novel, тАШThe Woman Warrior.тАЩ I last read the novel when I was a teenager, but IтАЩm utterly entranced by it again.тАЭ тАХ Leta Hong Fincher, author of тАЬBetraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in ChinaтАЭ тАЬI just watched filmmaker Jong Ougie PakтАЩs highly anticipated film featurette тАШSunrise/Sunset.тАЩ ItтАЩs a New York love story shot in black and white and spoken almost entirely in Korean. Though the film itself chronicles a complicated relationship, including heartbreak, what I appreciate about it in this current moment is its reminder of how cities are full of people, full of interactions, full of life. ItтАЩs something IтАЩm holding on to in anticipation of brighter days ahead.тАЭ тАХ Ellen D. Wu, associate professor and history director in the Asian American studies program at Indiana University Bloomington тАЬAlice Wu was one of the only female Asian directors around when I started writing my film тАШYellow Rose.тАЩ Her film тАШSaving FaceтАЩ was groundbreaking at the time it came out because it featured all Asian leads, a lesbian storyline and a director who was Asian but more importantly, smart, witty and original. Alice was an inspiration to me and a generation of other female Asian directors to keep pursuing their vision. I loved the film so much that I reached out to her producer, who ironically came on as one of my first producers. Her follow-up film тАХ тАШThe Half Of ItтАЩ тАХ took as long as it took me to eventually make my film, but it was worth the wait and itтАЩs every bit as relevant, clever and moving.тАЭ тАХ Diane Paragas, director of тАЬYellow RoseтАЭ тАЬIтАЩve watched these guys grow up from making Justin Timberlake and Jason Mraz music videos to doing original productions now. And throughout their 10-plus-year career in the public eye, theyтАЩve always been unashamedly proud Asian Americans willing to explore relevant identity and relationship issues, challenge stereotypes, and celebrate Asian American culture. And theyтАЩve always managed to do it all with a sense of humor and humility. ItтАЩs a fun escape getting lost in their YouTube channel.тАЭ тАХ Jonathan Jui, cartoonist A post shared by Wong Fu Productions (@wongfupro) on May 10, 2020 at 10:51am PDT тАЬQueer podcasting is hard to come by, more so if it features Asian American hosts. тАШNancy,тАЩ co-hosted by Tobin Low and Kathy Tu, does a fantastic job at covering both heartwarming and hilarious stories about what it means to be LGBTQ+ today. One of my favorite episodes is тАШTaiwan,тАЩ where one of the co-hosts, Kathy, returns to Taiwan to reconnect with her cultural roots and engage in the tricky business of explaining her sexuality to those who remained behind. At the end of the day, тАШNancyтАЩ is a timely and pertinent podcast that centers the voices of many queer Asian Americans, and what makes it extra precious is that it is made with a lot of heart.тАЭ тАХ Skyler Wang, sociologist at UC Berkeley тАЬThis is a new weekly podcast by Sharon Lee Thony (Chinese American) and Raman Sehgal (Indian American) featuring conversations on race and gender, with guests of all stripes (black, white, brown, yellow, boy, girl, gay, straight). Since many of societyтАЩs issues stem from a lack of empathy and understanding, the podcast uncovers how weтАЩre the same and how weтАЩre different through guestsтАЩ stories from many cultural backgrounds. In their first few episodes, theyтАЩve already spoken with a Hispanic media leader, a stand-up comedian, and an Arab tennis pro.тАЭ тАХ Rajiv Satyal, a standup comedian Got a great recommendation?

But the national correspondent assured the audience that most people they interviewed were cooperative and тАЬopen to talking to us.тАЭ Later, on her Twitter, Chen also thanked supporters who тАЬreached outтАЭ in support.

Thankful that in OUR country, the 1st amendment giving him the right to say that also gives us the right to keep on reporting. Chen and her crew were reporting on the crowds at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, out to celebrate Memorial Day weekend. The city had an executive order this past week that police can have authority to enforce the social distancing rules, which were violated by many beachgoers earlier. The Centers for Disease Control recommend that people stay more than six feet apart to avoid spreading the virus, or COVID-19, which still does not have a vaccine. All 50 states have lifted stay-at-home restrictions, even as the death toll rises to nearly 100,000. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a White House coronavirus task force member, said that going outside this week was fine, but with proper cautionary methods. тАЬGo out, wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from anyone so you can have the physical distancing,тАЭ Dr. Fauci said in a CNN coronavirus-specific Town Hall. тАЬGo for a run, go for a walk, go fishingтАФas long as youтАЩre not in a crowd, and youтАЩre not in a situation where you can physically transmit the virus.тАЭ Chen reported that the CNN crew were the only ones wearing masks that day, with parties тАЬpretty well spaced out from each other.тАЭ Although she was not wearing a mask, Chen said she does not wear one on-camera, but puts it back while walking in a crowd.

During the Cold War years, Asian Americans are simultaneously heralded as a Model Minority and targeted as the perpetual foreigner. It is also a time of bold ambition, as Asian Americans aspire for the first time to national political office and a coming culture-quake simmers beneath the surface.

3386,Americans split on discrimination against Asian Americans during COVID-19 pandemic,"Democrats more than Republicans and independents are more likely to agree that discrimination against Asian Americans is increasing during the coronavirus pandemic. A Harris Poll taken online April 18 -20 among 2029 adults found 61% of Democrats think discrimination against Asian Americans has increased compared to just 31% of Republicans and 42% of independents. 56% of Republicans say they are not at all or not very concerned about the hate/discrimination towards Asian Americans related to the Coronavirus pandemic. 42% of independents feel the same way compared to just 26% of Democrats Millennials and Gen Z appear to be much more sympathetic toward Asian Americans than older people. 66% of those 18-34 say they are concerned about this hate and discrimination.

3388,"My PBS Debut! On ├втВм┼УAsian Americans,├втВм┬Э Speaking Up and Our Legacies","Annie Tan Teacher, Activist, Storyteller. IтАЩm always haunted by the murder of my cousin Vincent Chin and his impact on the Asian American movement. I shared his legacy and that of his mother, my great-aunt Lily Chin, in my PBS debut (!!!), a digital feature for тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ, a 5-hour documentary series (YouTube/Facebook/Instagram). More on teaching and тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ below! I canтАЩt believe I am still тАЬcreatingтАЭ and pushing out new work during this #COVID19 pandemic. Another thing IтАЩm immensely proud of my latest interview in The New Republic about remote learning, speaking up as a teacher about how it has been extremely difficult trying to work around the inequities of public schooling before and during this pandemic. It has been shared all around by teaching communities online, and I hope has complicated the narrative around what remote learning and schooling looks like right now. I have 12 students, and I have three paraprofessionals in my classroom. And in our class alone, weтАЩve had something like 13 deaths, among our studentsтАЩ and staff membersтАЩ families. So itтАЩs been a challenge trying to roll out assignments while also supporting the mental health needs of my students, their families, and staff: Is this assignment IтАЩm pushing right now really important when my studentsтАЩ relatives are dying or sick? I was asked this weekend, тАЬHow are you getting through this coronavirus pandemic?тАЭ My answer, among many others, is on a list (published yesterday) from HuffPost Asian Voices of 21 Asian American-produced media recommended by Asian American creators like me (!) for you to consume at home! I have read, heard, and seen a number of these recommendations, but I am particularly excited about Cathy Park HongтАЩs Minor Feelings, which I just bought and canтАЩt wait to dig into! Below is my recommendation for how IтАЩm getting through this coronavirus: тАЬThe Yan Can Cook BookтАЭ by Martin Yan and тАЬWisdom of the Chinese KitchenтАЭ by Grace Young тАЬMy mom has always expressed her love, not through words lost in translation, but through food, whether through her Cantonese steamed fish with ginger and scallions, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce or soy sauce chicken. So, while distancing from Mom, when not getting takeout to support Chinatown restaurants, IтАЩm learning my momтАЩs dishes. I remembered watching Martin Yan as a kid on PBS and whipped out his old-school тАШThe Yan Can Cook BookтАЩ to make those spare ribs. And I picked up тАШWisdom of the Chinese KitchenтАЩ by Grace Young, a chef whoтАЩs been chronicling Chinatown coronavirus stories, then picked up a whole fish from a still-open Chinatown seafood market and figured out, with GraceтАЩs help, how my mom would make that fish. Last week, Mom came to Chinatown for her monthly trip to the Chinese pharmacy, bringing compliments on my WeChat fish photo and multiple containers of her soy sauce chicken. And I knew sheтАЩd always be with me.тАЭ And now for the meat of this postтАж I finished watching the 5-hour тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ PBS documentary series last night (which premiered this Monday and Tuesday on PBS and which you can stream free all #APAHM /watch on Amazon Prime), and just WOW. I knew a good number of larger themes in Asian American history, like exclusion and anti-Asian immigration laws, but the documentary series, particularly the 3rd episode тАЬGood AmericansтАЭ walked through the тАЬmodel minority myth,тАЭ its use to attack non-тАЬmodelтАЭ Black and Brown groups, and the subtle ways it was (and has) been used to subvert white supremacy, which is so nuanced, especially today. I watched an interview with Geeta Gandbhir, the director of the 5th episode тАЬBreaking ThroughтАЭ that the theme of the last episode was supposed to be тАЬJustice or Just Us?тАЭ That is a larger question, especially with the coverage of the Rodney King Riots and Latasha HarlinтАЩs murder, that we have to grapple with as an Asian American community. There was so much packed into the documentary (I also ended up live-tweeting the whole 5-hour PBS тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ documentary series in a thread if you want to read it all!). The first two hours were more than many of us had learned in our K-12 education! Yet there are SO many stories that still need to be told. And we, Asian Americans, have to be the ones to tell them. Stream тАЬAsian Americans,тАЭ free all this May #AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth, and watch on Amazon Prime! After that, watch my PBS digital extra feature on the legacy of my cousin Vincent Chin and great aunt Lily Chin (also on YouTube/Facebook/Instagram). I was really fortunate to be able to film with Geeta Gandbhir, the director of the 5th episode тАЬBreaking Through,тАЭ ever wise in questioning and thoughtfulness, over two days, one day interviewing in late June 2019 in a Brooklyn studio, and then a 2nd day in multiple locations throughout the Detroit area. From my knowledge, I was supposed to represent one of a younger generation of activist in PBSтАЩ тАЬAsian Americans,тАЭ but again you canтАЩt fit all of Asian American history into 5 hours! I still canтАЩt believe I was filmed for a PBS documentary (especially since I first learned about Vincent Chin through ANOTHER PBS documentary) even if my interview wasnтАЩt included in the final cut of the documentary. I am constantly thinking about the legacy I want to leave for my students and, hopefully, my children one day, and hope this feature helps others also consider their legacy. On the first day of filming in late June 2019, I shared my experiences growing up in Chinatown, how that led to me becoming a teacher, and how itтАЩs important for my students and students of color to see themselves represented in their school buildings. I spoke on my work with CAAAV, which has been leading anti-racist housing and language justice-oriented tenant work for my Chinatown and for communities around New York City, and which was founded after the Vincent Chin case. I also spoke about CAAAVтАЩs courage on and my advocacy during the Akai Gurley and Peter Liang case (which is how Renee Tajima-Pe├▒a, series producer on тАЬAsian Americans,тАЭ knew my work in the first place), and how that writing led me to move back to New York City. While all of that didnтАЩt end up making the digital feature or the documentary, IтАЩll continue amplifying those stories where I can (and actually doing some work around their karaoke fundraiser the rest of this week!) What DID end up in there was my story that I first shared at a Moth SLAM and then the Moth Radio Hour: IтАЩm glad that story will continue to be amplified and that people will be inspired to fight on. On the 2nd day of filming in July 2019, I was toured around by Helen Zia (!!!) for a whole day. Helen Zia was one of the lead activists on the Vincent Chin case and has since served as one of my idols and mentors through my life. We first visited Vincent and Lily ChinтАЩs house, where my great aunt would make food for all the organizers- Lily had worked in the back of a restaurant and knew just how dirty the food could be back there, so she didnтАЩt want the organizers fighting for her son to be fed that food. We walked over to the office where Vincent was supposed to start as a draftsmen, which was just blocks away, so he could be a good son to his mother Lily. We actually went into the Ferndale Public Library to use the bathroom and, on a whim, to see if any of Helen ZiaтАЩs books were in that branch- to no avail. Helen and I filmed in front of the Ferndale plaque commemorating Vincent ChinтАЩs death and legacy, then had lunch in the location formerly known as Golden Star Chinese Restaurant where Vincent Chin used to pick up shifts and where Asian American organizers, such as Ronald Hwang and Jim Shimoura, Asian American lawyers in Michigan back in the 1980s, organized to fight for justice. (I wish the digital feature had shown some of HelenтАЩs, JimтАЩs, and RolandтАЩs stories together, but, again, тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ only had five hours!) We went to the former McDonaldтАЩs site where Vincent Chin tried to run away from Eben and Nitz, where VincentтАЩs skull was bashed into the pavement with a baseball bat, and for which Ebens and Nitz never served a day in jail. And we bought flowers and brought them to Vincent Chin, Lily Chin, and David Bing Hing ChinтАЩs graves at Forest Lawn Cemetery. Of course, right at the end of the day at the cemetery, it began raining, and it felt right, like something new was coming. It was a long day, 9am-6pm, and full of emotion and rawness. I will never forget that day, knowing just how much work it took to build an Asian American movement, and how much more we have to build. Watching the documentary now, I KNOW there are SO many stories that were missing- you canтАЩt fit all of Asian American history into 5 hours. And so, we have to tell them. NO one will tell our stories for us. Without Lily ChinтАЩs organizing and activism, no one would know Vincent ChinтАЩs name today, and I take that with me every day. ThatтАЩs why IтАЩm dedicated to writing a book about my family moving forward, because no one else will. And thatтАЩs why I continue writing, and storytelling, and doing all the activism and organizing in the forefront and behind the scenes to make our society better. For the last time, stream тАЬAsian Americans,тАЭ free all this May #AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth, and watch on Amazon Prime! And, after that, watch my PBS digital extra feature on the legacy of my cousin Vincent Chin and great aunt Lily Chin (also on YouTube/Facebook/Instagram). Rest in power, Vincent and Lily. Thank you for fighting for all of us to be able to tell our stories. Thanks for reading, Annie Annie Tan: Teacher, Activist, Storyteller.

3421,Illustrated Profiles | Asian and Asian American Studies Institute,"Our websites may use cookies to personalize and enhance your experience. By continuing without changing your cookie settings, you agree to this collection. For more information, please see our University Websites Privacy Notice. College of Liberal Arts and Sciences The Asian and Asian American Studies Institute is proud to launch a mental health arts initiative to respond to the challenges and concerns faced by all of our college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. While our students have bravely answered the call to stay at home to prevent the spread of the disease, they are confronted with incredible challenges as they and their families are put under strain. This project brings together personal updates written by students with artists who identify with the stories to acknowledge, share, and reflect upon the experiences. We know our students are strong and resilient, but recognizing their feelings of regret, failure, vulnerability, shame, anxiety, and loneliness is necessary to navigate these new conditions. Art is a gateway to recovery because it shows students that their experiences are worthy of being recognized and they are affirmed by the recognition that such portrayals then evoke.┬а The connection between trauma and art therapy is well known, but less known are the ways that Asian American studies has had a deep connection with trauma, art, and recuperation. From the artist collectives of the 1960s and 70s to the use of art as an archive standing in for the absence of other recorded evidence, art has given shape to the field of Asian American studies in powerful ways. UConn has been home to top scholars in this field, including Emeritus Professor Margo Machida. Her award-winning and pathbreaking work to illuminate Asian American artists, explore their aesthetic practices, and question how art communicates the history and experience of Asian America is foundational to the field. Also, Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor and Associate Dean for Humanities and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (CLAS), Professor Cathy Schlund-Vials has also been a leader in this field through her scholarship on Cambodian refugee memory work found in their artistic expression. There are numerous other examples of the ways that Asian American Studies engaged the arts. A pivotal example is the tremendous work of the Asian American Literary Review, which permeated scholarship, syllabi, professional organizations, and cultural institutions. Another example would be the SmithsonianтАЩs Asian Pacific American CenterтАЩs recent online release of the Care Package, which curates a collection of multi-media art to support us all in these difficult times.┬а Indeed, many have turned to art to respond to the pandemicтАЩs racist politics, cultural isolation, and emotional toll. Notable among them is the #IAmNotAVirus campaign, started by Connecticut resident Mike Keo, along with UConn Asian American studies alum and MSW student Kelly Ha. Artists have always been key to responding to the legacies of racialization, demonization, and scapegoating of diseases as with SARS and AIDS. The social realities of distancing during the pandemic have led to a resurgence of art practice in zines to boost resistance, mutual aid, and self-care. These artistic expressions and journalistic records of individual experiences are valuable history-making in our time as also reflected in the UConn Archives and Special Collections project that documents personal experiences of the pandemic.┬а The Asian and Asian American Studies Institute humbly draws upon these traditions to openly invite others to contribute their experiences and solicit corresponding art work. Consider contributing to this project to capture student experiences and raise awareness about the personal and societal impacts of the lack of medical preparation, access to testing, imbalanced relief, and deepening inequality.┬а тАЬAfter I found out that all students have to go back home due to the coronavirus pandemic, I came back on Saturday, March 14th back to my house in Naugatuck. I do feel safe because I am at home with my family. I also have a good amount of resources, I made sure I packed some toilet paper from my apartment, as well as other necessities that are convenient during this time. I also feel blessed that my family can make home-cooked meals. In other words, my family is Punjabi therefore we cook Punjabi food that is enough for all of us at this time. We also have access to affordable health care, and as of now all of us are keeping each other healthy by washing our hands when we come back from outside. The only concerns shaping my experience is the fact that we all have to stay home. It can be quite boring at times because there is only so much you can do, also Governor Lamont recently announced how all salons cannot operate at this time, and since my mother owns a beauty salon that means she has to stop working. However, on a lighter but also unfortunate note, I got surgery within my mouth and I canтАЩt eat some of my favorite foods, which really makes it troublesome because not only am I locked in my house, but I also canтАЩt even eat the food that I want. Overall, it is what it is and IтАЩm only looking at everything positively and keeping myself busy and healthy. Update: I am feeling much better than before, thank you for your concern. I can now eat the foods I like and everything is in the process of healing. ItтАЩs been a whole month since my family and I have been quarantined so weтАЩre just making the best out of the situation. Online classes take up most of my time, but when I am free I like to take some time for myself by either exercising, putting on a face mask, dancing, sketching, doing random photo shoots inside my house or on my porch, and even writing in my journal. I love music, so IтАЩve been listening to the same songs. i also am writing a small story and have been watching that show Tiger King just to see what all the hype is about. I have a small scar on the side of my face where the surgery was done, and I joke around how by the time my scar goes away quarantine will be over. I hope that would be true, but at the moment all we can do is wait and be positive. I pray for the world every night, hopefully we can be outside soon, especially before my birthday!тАЭ ARTIST: Simi Kang Simi Kang is a Sikh American educator, scholar, artist, and community advocate. Her work centers Asian American stories and knowledges to interrogate the intersection of environmental injustice and policy. KangтАЩs scholarship and art have appeared in The Asian American Literary Review, Gravy Quarterly, Hyphen Magazine, Kartika Review, Open Rivers: Rethinking Water, Place & Community, and Jaggery: A DesiLit Arts and Literature Journal. She is currently a Mellon Sawyer Postdoctoral Fellow in the History Department at Carnegie Mellon University. тАЬI am feeling as safe as I can possibly feel during this situation. In the beginning, safety was a huge concern for everyone. But after seeing the efforts the general public and the government put in place to make sure everyone can at least have access to help if they need it, I believe that safety is no longer that large of a concern. I am currently living at home with my parents and brother. Food security was a huge topic for my family, as I would imagine it would be for most of us. At first, we struggled with both what and how much food can be available to us. However, something that really helped were public efforts to provide food for everyone. For my town specifically, there have been centers where free, healthy food is provided to us. This has made a world of a difference for us. In general, my family has 2 family members who are a little vulnerable. Because of this, we have been diligent in making sure things are clean and safe. My mother, specifically, is an RN who works at odd hours with crowds. I am very fortunate to have access to affordable health care and medication. The main things causing stress during this experience would be the emotional/mental toll accommodating to this virus has taken on my family. The stress everyone, especially my parents, are enduring in order to find resources, work, take care of us, and more has really mounted up. And in the beginning, this really affected the family dynamic, resulting in some toxic emotional situations for us. However, I believe that the experiences and difficulties we are going through as a family really highlight issues that have long been a part of this household, and it could be a way to finally resolve them, as they escalate. If I am being completely honest with myself, I admit to falling into despair after coming back, and I think this is an experience a lot of kids in traditional Asian American first generation families are going through. It makes me guilty, but in all honesty, going to college is a huge part of cementing myself and being free. Coming back to the same norms and toxic situations really makes you struggle a lot with this. However, as time has gone by, learning to adapt to this has taught me a lot about growing up. Before, I never realized that emotional support and health is so heavily dependent on having people outside of your family, and I didnтАЩt understand that. But after realizing this, it has made a world of difference for me, and I people with a similar situation can realize this soon as well.тАЭ ARTIST: Dinh Tran Dinh Tran is a California-based graphic designer who provides design and consulting solutions to help brands and products grow. Dinh has worked on projects with, but not limited to, Disney Consumer Products, FAO Schwarz, Warner Brothers, and The Sharper image. He is also heavily involved with the Vietnamese American community in Orange County and nationally through the Scouting program. тАЬYes, I feel very safe. I live in Mansfield actually and am located a mere two and a half miles from the UConn campus in the woods. IтАЩll be living here, with my mother and father, for the remainder of the year. Yes, the local Price Chopper is open along with other even more local food co-ops. Yes, my father and mother are mid-sixties so I am trying to do all I can to keep myself contained and them safe. Not to mention my grandparents who are also in their nineties and live in Tampa, Florida. Yes, thankfully my family and I are insured due to my mom working for the university. Other concerns I have are for my friends whoтАЩs parents own local businesses, mainly food, which are being hit especially hard by this pandemic. I worry as they do not have the same security as my family and I do and am helping them in any way we can. Update: Feeling good, still in isolation with my family (its own issue) but we are feeling well and no signs of sickness. Thankfully as I mentioned last time my mom works for the University so IтАЩm sure youтАЩre aware of the benefits and weтАЩre all eternally grateful for these. IтАЩve been doing some compiling for the final Zine too. Every time I go out in public I take pictures of all the measures we as a society are taking in order to combat the pandemic. ItтАЩs quite cool to see how our society has shifted in time of crisis from week one to week four and five. I was even able to convince some workers to allow me to take pictures of them behind the glass dividers used to protect from contaminants. Other than this thereтАЩs not much occurring with me. I am working, doing my work as I can but itтАЩs so hard considering the quality has diminished in so many aspects due simply to the fact that learning has gone onto an on line setting. ItтАЩs very interesting talking with friends from dorms, classes, etc and how this is not what any of us (from anyone) expected an on line experience to consist of for a $30,000 education; and thatтАЩs in-state.тАЭ ARTIST: Szu-Chieh Yun Szu-Chieh Yun is a Boston-based artist whose practice explores themes of migration, immigration, and transformation with a focus on the Chinese diaspora. She is a first-generation Taiwanese-American. Szu-ChiehтАЩs work derives from her experience in crossing between distinct cultures and places. Her work is a response to the spaces she has traveled to, her surroundings, and in reflection of her identity. Find her website here тАЬFor the most part, I do feel safe. IтАЩm currently living at my parentsтАЩ house in Branford, CT and will stay there for the foreseeable future. Yes I have the resources for healthy and reliable food, although we are looking at means to potentially have food delivered to us in the event that going to the grocery store is unsafe. Yes, my parents have pre-existing conditions, more of my friends than I thought are immunocompromised, my grandparents living in Michigan cannot leave their apartments. Many concerns, too many to state, but overall the pandemic and the whole experience has drastically altered my life and put a nasty stain on what would have been an amazing senior spring. To branch off on question #5. IтАЩm frightened that this spontaneous end is going to be the lasting memory of my time at UConn. IтАЩm terrified that I may not ever get the chance to properly say goodbye to some of the people I wanted to. IтАЩm concerned for the safety of my friends and peers, and for the whole nation, IтАЩm shocked to see how young people do not take it seriously. I worry about how the economic impact will impact my familyтАЩs retirement accounts. ItтАЩs confusing and hurtful to me to have people talk about it as тАЬthe Chinese VirusтАЭ, not knowing what the impact of these words can be to Asian Americans. I cry at the fact that a childhood dream of mine, to walk at my college graduation, may never be realized, and how it took so much time and work to get to this stage for it to all go to waste.тАЭ ARTIST: Quyen Truong Quyen Truong is a fine artist and graphic designer who has exhibited in New York City, Boston, and across New England.

3436,Asian Americans Are Rallying Together Against Coronavirus-Related Hate Crimes - Supermajority,"Photo courtesy of Shutterstock Asian American celebrities, community groups, and nonprofits are responding to a recent spike in verbal harassment and violence committed against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community connected to the COVID-19 epidemic. Advocates say more needs to be done to protect immigrant communities from such incidents and from the continuing economic fallout stemming from COVID-19. тАЬHate crimes and hate incidents are chronically underreported,тАЭ Marita Etcuba├▒ez, the Director of Strategic Initiatives for Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC), told Supermajority News. тАЬWe are really urging the community to share their stories with us so that we can get a better understanding of what is happening.тАЭ According to Etcuba├▒ez, several groups already increased their tracking of hate incidents against the AAPI communities since January 2017 in response to an increase of such occurrences after the 2016 election. Since the coronavirus epidemic began to more seriously affect the U.S., an increasing number of AAPI community members have been reaching out to file reports on AAJCтАЩs multilingual Stand Against Hatred website. тАЬEarly on we were very vocal about the presidentтАЩs and other elected officialsтАЩ usage terms like тАШthe china virusтАЩ and some of the pushback we were getting was that тАШyou are being overly P.C.,тАЭ Etcuba├▒ez said. тАЬBut these words have consequences.тАЭ Asian American women in particular have reported an increase in coronavirus-related abuse in recent weeks. In a March 30 press release, the National Asian Pacific American WomenтАЩs Forum (NAPAWF) noted that AAPI women were three times more likely to have reported experiencing a hate-related incident than men the week of March 23, which coincided with the closure of many businesses nationwide. тАЬThese are hard-working women, business owners, leaders, and contributing members of society who deserve respect and support,тАЭ said NAPAWF president Sue Ann Hong in a statement. тАЬVerbal harassment and shunning cause fear that negatively impacts the safety of the AAPI community and the economy.тАЭ To combat this, AAJC recently partnered with the anti-street harassment organization Hollaback to put together a free online bystander intervention training series; several trainings are scheduled for later this spring and summer. тАЬWe have also been talking to groups that have been organizing in their communities urging local elected officials to use their platforms to speak out,тАЭ Etcuba├▒ez said. Elected officials тАЬshouldnтАЩt just wait for something to happen, they should affirmatively let the community know that they are not alone,тАЭ Etcuba├▒ez added. The community can also come together by fully harnessing their power at the voting booth. A recent analysis from the Pew Research Center found that Asian Americans make up the fastest-growing group of voters in the United States. Despite that, turnout has not always been high among this demographic. тАЬPeople need to get involved. Fill out your census form. If you are a U.S. citizen, register to vote. Make sure you actually do vote,тАЭ said Etcuba├▒ez. тАЬPeople need to be engaged, and I think they need to vote their values and hold their elected officials accountable for meeting their communitiesтАЩ needs.тАЭ Previous Post May 18, 2020 Next Post May 19, 2020 Supermajority Education Fund, a project of the New Venture Fund 1201 Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20036 Telephone: (202) 595-1061 Fax: (202) 833-5540",0,0,1,1
3471,Why I Gladly Signed the Statement on Anti-Asian Racism ├втВмтАЭ Asian American Christian Collaborative (AACC),"A writer and ally on why signing the AACC statement was important to him. By Matt Mikalatos Last week a CBS reporter named Weija Jiang asked President Trump a question, and he told her to тАЬgo ask China.тАЭ When she asked why he would say that to her specifically, he responded by saying that he would have said it to anyone who asked him that тАЬnasty question.тАЭ Setting aside politics, this is what breaks my heart about the current reality for my Asian and Asian American friends right now. They are dealing with the same problems as everyone else: the trauma of the unexpected changes in the world; the potentially life-and-death decisions of whether to stay home and for how long; the boredom or fear or worry that comes in the midst of stay-at-home orders and/or re-openings; illness; and the loss of loved ones. But they are also dealing with the reality of anti-Asian bias, of different people stoking the fears of тАЬYellow PerilтАЭ to distract from reasonable questions about our own response to the pandemic. They are facing the possibility of unpleasant encounters, micro-aggressions, being blamed for the pandemic, and even assault. I have a number of friends who are Trump supporters who say the above example wasnтАЩt racist or biased. It was (and here there will be a long explanation) the president saying that all of the problems weтАЩre facing are ChinaтАЩs fault (China the government, not Chinese people and certainly not Asian people and definitely not Asian American people). But thatтАЩs not what was said. WeтАЩre all left to put our own spin on it, to figure it out, to check for dog whistles, and make decisions about whether the racist reading of the interaction was intentional, or just the result of unexamined bias. Meanwhile, I have Asian American friends who went out for groceries and were spit at. I have friends who have asked their white friends to do their errands for them. I have friends whose parents donтАЩt feel safe when they leave their homes, not because of the virus, but because of other people. And again, all of this on top of everything we are all facing in this time. When the Asian American Christian Collaborative was founded and released the тАЬStatement on Anti-Asian Racism in the Time of COVID-19,тАЭ two friends reached out to me and asked if I would consider signing it. One of them was Dr. Michelle Reyes, the vice president of AACC. We have never met in person, but she has been very generous and kind to me, coming on our podcast and doing a two-hour phone call with me about story and fairytales to help me with a book IтАЩm working on. SheтАЩs someone I deeply respect and have learned a great deal from. The other was someone IтАЩve known practically since she was a kid, Sandhya Oaks. She and I have talked multiple times over the years about the specific challenges she has faced working in majority-white spaces (the same place I was working). Then, when I looked at the site and saw the amazing people who had written the document, I saw people like Margaret Yu, who has ministered alongside me more than once, and who has been a wise and caring presence in my life. I vividly remember a time when I was navigating a sticky situation related to ethnic diversity in our organization. She not only supported me through it, but she also stood up for me and helped another leader understand where I was coming from when I couldnтАЩt clearly express myself. I saw Vivian Mabuni, who is a friend that has talked with me more than once about writing and ministry. WeтАЩve exchanged advice and prayed for each other. IтАЩve watched in amazement as sheтАЩs gone on to build an incredible platform of teaching and writing. And then I saw Helen Lee, whose voice has been informative and encouraging on Twitter, and whom I consider a friend. Looking at the others on that page, they were nearly all people with whom I had mutual friends or whom I knew by reputation. Even some of the graphic design on the site was done by a friend, Jocelyn Chung, whom I had the great pleasure of hanging out with last summer. I saw that this statement had been drafted by people I know, love, trust, and respect. That was all before I had even read the statement. After I read it, I didnтАЩt have a long, soul-searching decision to make. I honestly donтАЩt understand why anyoneтАФindividual or corporateтАФwouldnтАЩt sign it. ItтАЩs a call for an end to anti-Asian bias, hateful rhetoric, and violence. I signed it gladly and without hesitation. These are my friends, and I have many, many more friends who are Asian or Asian American who also deserve to be treated with respect. My sister-in-law is Asian American. My nephew is Asian American. Of course I would sign this statement, and I hope, if you are reading this and havenтАЩt signed, that you will too. Currently, over 10,000 people have signed the statement or joined the Asian American Christian Collaborative (AACC). People I know and love have experienced anti-Asian bias, and IтАЩm guessing thatтАЩs true of your friends and family as well. I want to invite you to sign if you havenтАЩt, and join the community.

3527,PBS├втВмтДв ├втВм╦ЬAsian Americans├втВмтДв explores prejudice and perseverance,"ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 The PBS documentary series тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ that airs next week is a sweeping look at their impact on society, politics and pop culture between the mid-19th century and 9/11. The show features reflections from people like U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a McKinley High School graduate. A century of racist attacks detailed in the new PBS documentary series тАЬAsian AmericansтАЭ might have felt like ancient history just a few months ago. But through the lens of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China and is now hitting the U.S., being painted as a foreign enemy has become all too familiar. Hundreds of Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nationтАЩs first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have hurled century-old slurs like тАЬChinaman.тАЭ Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TVтАЩs тАЬLostтАЭ and тАЬHawaii Five-0,тАЭ faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim, who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels тАЬback to 100%.тАЭ тАЬItтАЩs been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But itтАЩs part of the price one pays for speaking out, even against something as seemingly universal as injustice,тАЭ Kim said in an email to The Associated Press. The five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian AmericansтАЩ impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century through 9/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, тАЬFresh Off the BoatтАЭ star Randall Park and a host of people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured. May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when AsiansтАЩ contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted. The virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month, Korean American actor John Cho wrote how тАЬbelonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who тАШbroughtтАЩ the virus here.тАЭ That anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said. тАЬThose who forget history are condemned to repeat it,тАЭ Kim said. тАЬAsian Americans have a unique history in America. ItтАЩs one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part of our nationтАЩs history.тАЭ Renee Tajima-Pe├▒a, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s. тАЬWe start at a time where we can still find people, if theyтАЩre descendants, with pictures and photographs,тАЭ Tajima-Pe├▒a said. тАЬOn the one hand, there was choosing which stories we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, itтАЩs TV. We have to make sure itтАЩs something thatтАЩs watchable and the audience can engage with.тАЭ The series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit. But it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress. ThereтАЩs also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Comedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary тАЬThe Problem With Apu,тАЭ speaks in the series about post-9/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time. Like Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time. тАЬI had never been targeted the way I had been in 9/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,тАЭ he said at a virtual town hall last week. тАЬThe generation after 9/11 тАж theyтАЩre gonna have to question where we are now. ItтАЩs going to inform how they will see the world.тАЭ HeтАЩs glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary. тАЬOnce itтАЩs on PBS, it feels like an official document,тАЭ Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. тАЬThis marks our place in the history of this country. It wasnтАЩt there before.тАЭ Tajima-Pe├▒a wouldnтАЩt alter the episodes to address the pandemic if she could, saying viewers will inevitably connect it to present-day xenophobia. ItтАЩs a тАЬnew story that really is an old story.тАЭ тАЬThe whole COVID crisis, itтАЩs really just amplified all the fault lines in the United States of race and class, poverty, health care. In terms of Asian Americans, of course, itтАЩs this idea weтАЩre so-called foreigners,тАЭ she said. One of her hopes is the series will inspire younger Asian Americans to think beyond social media rants to activism. тАЬOur backs are against the walls. How do we move forward together? ThatтАЩs what you see in the series,тАЭ Tajima-Pe├▒a said. тАЬAsian Americans had to come together to defend our own rights.тАЭ Click here to see our full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.

3578,10 Asian American contributions that need more recognition,"In The Know On Oct. 5, 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed a law that designated the first seven days of May as тАЬAsian Pacific American Heritage Week,тАЭ to acknowledge AmericaтАЩs first Japanese immigrants and the Chinese immigrants who helped build the railroads. The proclamation came a year after U.S. Representatives Frank Horton of New York and Norman Y. Mineta of California, along with Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, introduced separate joint resolutions that failed to pass. In 1992, under President George H.W. BushтАЩs administration, the U.S. Congress finally passed a law that extended the weeklong celebration to a month-long one. In truth, the move was overdue. As the Japanese American Citizens League notes, the arrival of the first Asians in central North America, in fact, predates the founding of the U.S. In the late 18th century, the first Asian settlers were Filipino migrants тАФ who arrived at what is now New Orleans and Acapulco, Mexico to escape Spanish colonial rule. The Chinese later followed in huge waves during the mid-19th century, in search of gold and other fortunes in California. Since then, Asian Americans have endured both xenophobia and racism тАФ from the mass lynching of Chinese people in 1871 to the excessive portrayal of South Asians as terrorists тАФ without being duly appreciated for the contributions they have made. With the exception of a few lines dedicated to the 20,000 Chinese workers who constructed the transcontinental railroads, Asian Americans have largely been erased from the history books used in elementary and secondary education, as Pacific StandardтАЩs Ellen Lee points out. In an effort to raise awareness, weтАЩve compiled a list of 10 underappreciated contributions that Asians and Asian Americans have made in the U.S. over the last 200 years. In 1898, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that children born in America to foreigners were U.S. citizens. The decision came after a yearlong battle between Wong Kim Ark тАФ who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants тАФ and the U.S. Justice Department. At the time, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which had been passed in 1885 and denied citizenship to all Chinese laborers, was still in place. That meant WongтАЩs parents, who were considered subjects of the Emperor of China, could not be naturalized. In its argument before the high court, the Justice Department claimed that Wong himself was also not under the lawful jurisdiction of California because he was тАЬby reason of his race, language, color and dress, a Chinese person, and now is, and for some time last past has been, a laborer by occupation.тАЭ By that very description, Wong was supposedly not allowed to return to the U.S. from China following a short trip, even though he had been born on American soil. In response, Wong filed a writ of habeas corpus, and the Supreme Court ultimately sided him. In a 6-2 majority ruling, Justice Horace Gray, writing on behalf of the court, pointed out that the Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution automatically made Wong a citizen. Today, activists have cited the landmark decision in their criticism of TrumpтАЩs effort to deny citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. Some of the nationтАЩs most iconic buildings тАФ from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum тАФ were designed by Chinese American I.M. Pei, who was widely considered to be one of the greatest modern architects alongside Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson and Frank Gehry. Pei, who famously designed the Pyramid at the Louvre in Paris but initially faced backlash for being selected over French firms, left behind a legacy that тАЬcombined high design and corporate success with international impact,тАЭ according to architecture critic Carter Wiseman. Some of the architectтАЩs other notable buildings include the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Mesa Laboratory in Colorado and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art in New York. Pei, however, wasnтАЩt the only Asian American architect to leave his mark. Lesser-known Chinese American architects like Eugene Choy, Gilbert Leong, Gin Wong and Helen Liu Fong were instrumental in shaping the cityscape of Los Angeles in the postwar era. In New York, Japanese American Minoru Yamasaki, one of the masters of an architectural style called New Formalism, was best known for designing the original World Trade Center. Since immigrating to the U.S. from Vietnam in 1975, Dr. Tuan Vo-Dinh, a biomedical engineering professor at the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering, has built himself an impressive r├йsum├й. In addition to authoring more than 200 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and receiving more than 20 awards, honors and distinctions, Dr. Vo-Dinh also holds more than 20 U.S. patents, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One of those patents is the development of new gene probes that can detect cancer earlier than usual. Dr. Vo-DinhтАЩs other patents include a new method of treating metastatic bladder and breast cancer and another that targets cell proliferation disorders. Chances are you wouldnтАЩt be able to search for the hottest item or check your email if it werenтАЩt for several Asian American pioneers. In 1994, Taiwanese American Jerry Yang co-founded the web portal Yahoo! with David Filo, after ditching a doctoral program at Stanford University. Originally called тАЬJerry and DavidтАЩs Guide to the World Wide Web,тАЭ the portal was renamed Yahoo!, an acronym for тАЬYet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.тАЭ Incorporated in 1995 and later sold to Verizon Communications in 2016, the web portal has expanded its services to include a search engine, e-mail and news. Yahoo Mail, alone, now has more 200 million users. Yang wasnтАЩt the only Asian American to have a successful breakthrough in the tech industry. In 1996, Indian American businessman Sabeer Bhatia co-founded Windows Live Hotmail, a webmail service. Several years later, Microsoft acquired it for nearly $400 million and turned it to what is now Microsoft Outlook. In 2005, Taiwanese American Steven Chen, along with Bangladeshi-German American Jawed Karim and Pennsylvania native Chad Hurley, founded the widely popular video-sharing platform YouTube. Today, the Google-owned service has 2 billion users worldwide. In 2013, Amanda Nguyen, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, was raped while studying at Harvard University. While trying to access information on her rights as a sexual assault survivor, the then-college student ran into tremendous roadblocks. At the time, Nguyen still had to pay a significant amount of money every six months to make sure her rape kit wasnтАЩt destroyed, even though rape kits in Massachusetts were supposed to be kept for 15 years, according to Money magazine. That challenge led Nguyen to found Rise, a nonprofit organization that supports fellow sexual assault survivors, and write the Sexual Assault SurvivorsтАЩ Rights Act. The bill, which passed in 2016, gives survivors access to a forensic medical examination at no cost and allows them to preserve their rape kits without having to regularly request an extension. For her work, Nguyen was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2018. The popularity of mixed martial arts in the U.S. has grown largely due to MMA promotion companies Bellator and UFC. But many widely credit the birth of the contact combat sport to none other than Bruce Lee, a Hong Kong American actor, mixed martial artist and philosopher who, in 1965, developed Jeet Kune Do тАФ a form of martial arts that combined kung fu, fencing, boxing and his own techniques. тАЬUse only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it,тАЭ Lee once said. Although Lee never participated in professional fights, he trained several celebrities, including Steve McQueen, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Chuck Norris. He was also well-known for his physical prowess, from performing two-finger push-ups to executing his legendary one-inch punch. As an actor, he was best known for his roles in тАЬEnter the Dragon,тАЭ тАЬFist of Fury,тАЭ тАЬReturn of the Dragon,тАЭ тАЬGame of DeathтАЭ and тАЬThe Green Hornet.тАЭ Some of the most celebrated designers who helped shape New YorkтАЩs fashion industry in the 1980s and 1990s are Asian American: Anna Sui, Vivienne Tam, Vera Wang and Kimora Lee Simmons. Wang, for example, established herself at the forefront of bridal wear with her modern but elegant designs, while Simmons made a statement in streetwear with her apparel brand Baby Phat. Today, the number of prominent Asian American fashion designers has grown to include the likes of Prabal Gurung, Phillip Lim, Jason Wu, Derek Lam, Bibhu Mohapatra, Dao-Yi Chow, Alexander Wang, Carol Lim and Humberto Leon. As the New York Times interestingly notes, their presence in (and dominance of) the industry is most likely due to the fact that тАЬfashion values the concept of presentation.тАЭ In other words, many Asian Americans may see design as тАЬa way to connect to the cultural values of craftsmanship and use of luxury materials so historically prevalent in East and South Asian countries.тАЭ On September 6, 1965, Filipino American grape workers organized a nonviolent strike (alongside Cesar Chavez and his Latino farmworkers union, the National Farm Workers Association) against table and wine grape growers in Delano, Calif. It represented the first time a boycott was used in a major labor dispute. It also resulted in the merger of CesarтАЩs union and the Filipino workersтАЩ Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, which together became known as the United Farm Workers. Over the course of five years, members of the union relayed their message to fellow poor farmworkers and middle-class families that lived in the cities. In 1970, the table grape growers finally caved in to the unionтАЩs demands, promising the workers better pay, benefits and protections. To date, the United Farm Workers has more than 10,000 members, making it the countryтАЩs largest farmworker union. Over the last several decades, Asian food has essentially become the lifeblood of тАЬAmericanтАЭ cuisine. As the New York Times Style Magazine points out, the countryтАЩs infatuation with Asian food dates back to the late 19th century, when Cantonese restaurants were a hit in New York. At the time, the food was cheap and quickly prepared, making it especially attractive to non-Chinese customers. Over the years, Chinese chefs capitalized on the popularity of their food by tailoring it for the Western palette. Today, two of the largest restaurant chains in the U.S. serve тАЬAmerican-ChineseтАЭ food: P.F. ChangтАЩs China Bistro and Panda Express. Other versions of contemporary Asian American cuisine have seen their fair share of success. In 2004, Korean American chef David Chang, for instance, opened New York City ramen shop Momofuku Noodle Bar, which one New York Times critic glowingly called тАЬa plywood-walled diamond in the rough.тАЭ Four years later, fellow Korean American Roy Choi founded Kogi, a Korean barbecue taco truck company in California that has since turned into a food empire. Although the invention of the ice cream cone is credited to Italian immigrant Italo Marchiony, Syrian concessionaire Ernest A. Hamwi was perhaps the first to popularize it. While working at the 1904 St. Louis WorldтАЩs Fair, Hamwi noticed an ice cream vendor who ran out of dishes to serve the dessert. The Syrian, who was selling a waffle-like confection called zalabia, decided to help the vendor out by rolling his waffles to use as cones. The waffle cone immediately became a huge hit in Missouri, where multiple entrepreneurs started their own ice cream cone businesses. In 1910, Hamwi himself founded the Missouri Cone Company, which was later renamed the Western Cone Company.

3580,Police arrested a Bay Area woman who they say posted racist notes on the homes of Asian Americans,"tome213/Shutterstock A 52-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of posting handwritten messages targeting Asian Americans on their homes. The messages suggested that people not native to the US leave the country. Police in San Leandro received reports of notes containing ""insensitive messages towards minorities"" taped to five homes, according to the Associated Press. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. A 52-year-old woman in the San Francisco Bay Area was arrested on suspicion of a hate crime after police learned she was posting hateful handwritten messages on the homes of Asian-Americans, according to a statement from San Leandro Police Department. The messages suggested that men and women not native to the US leave the country immediately, according to the Associated Press, which saw a copy of one of the notes. ""If you are a woman or man and was born in other country, return, go back to your land immediately, fast, with urgency,"" the note said, according to The AP. It ended with ""One American, white, brave, that serves the Nation or USA is going to live here."" Officers in San Leandro, a suburb of 89,000 just south of Oakland, were called to the Heron Bay neighborhood Friday night after receiving reports of notes containing ""insensitive messages towards minorities"" taped to five homes. One resident gave the officers images captured on his Ring doorbell security camera of a woman taping the note, and the officers soon found her in the area, police said in a statement. Nancy Arechiga, 52, was carrying a backpack containing copies of the same notes, the statement said. She was arrested ""for these inappropriate messages that instilled fear and intimidation upon those residents."" ""San Leandro is a community of beautifully diverse people, who share a common desire to live in harmony, and free from intimidation,"" San Leandro Police Lieutenant Isaac Benabou said in a written statement. ""We welcome people's rights to express themselves, but not in a manner that infringes upon a community's sense of security and wellbeing."" Arechiga was taken to Alameda County jail and booked for investigation of committing a hate crime, according to the AP. She was issued a citation and released from custody, another police official, Lt. Ted Henderson, told the AP. The incident comes as Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders across the country face an uptick in racist harassment and attacks related to the coronavirus crisis. Over the past month alone, the group Stop AAPI Hate has received close to 1,500 reports of anti-Asian incidents, ranging from verbal harassment to physical assault, Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, told Business Insider in April. Police were also investigating whether Arechiga posted a similar note on a local trail earlier in the week. The note partially read, ""no Asians allowed, leave immediately,"" according to the police statement. An Asian-American woman told KGO-TV her family was shaken after finding a similar note posted on a tree trunk in the neighborhood. The woman, who asked not to be named for safety concerns, said ""reading this letter sends chills down my spine."" ""Obviously there's been a spike in attacks against the Asian American community due to this pandemic,"" she said. ""It's sad to see that.""

3594,Asian Americans,"Asian Americans are the highest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the U.S, with Asians now making up the largest share of recent immigrants. A Pew Research survey finds Asian Americans are more satisfied than the general public with their lives, finances and the direction of the country, and they place a greater value on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success.Full Report: The Rise of Asian AmericansMaps: Explore Asian-American Population DataInteractive: Demographics by Asian Origin GroupVideo: Pew Research Panel Discussion Asian Americans are a distinctive group, and the population is by no means a monolith. It is made up of immigrants or their descendants from dozens of countries in the Far East, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, each with a unique history, culture, language and pathway to America. While these groups share much in common, they also have a range of differences in their demographic characteristics, beliefs and perceptions of life in the United States. Compared with the general public, Asian Americans stand out for their success in education and career. Most also believe that the U.S. offers more opportunities and freedoms than their countries of origin. A large majority of Asian Americans believe that hard work pays off and most place a strong emphasis on higher education, career and family. In fact, a striking number of recent Asian immigrants hold college degrees. By their own accounts, many say their parents put too much pressure on their children to succeed. How do Asian Americans see themselves compared with the larger population? It depends on who you ask. On average, half of Asian Americans say they are very different from the typical American, and more than 60% of Vietnamese Americans and Korean Americans say they feel this way. Still, a majority say being an Asian American doesnтАЩt make a difference when it comes to some of the milestones in getting ahead, such as getting into college or getting a job or promotion. More Asian Americans say they are satisfied with their lives than the general public. Asian Americans stand out for their strong emphasis on family. They are more likely to be intermarried with other racial groups, their children are more likely to live in households with two married parents and they place a higher priority than the general public on having a successful marriage. As a group, they tend to lean Democrat and they maintain strong social ties with others from the same country of origin. Almost half live in the Western part of the United States.

3739,32 Community Based Organizations Release Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Neighborhood Recovery Plan,"Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) neighborhoods have experienced the economic devastation of COVID-19 since long before the shelter-in-place began. 32 AAPI community based organizations have united to release the following plan to call on New York City and State government officials to prioritize AAPI neighborhoods in recovery efforts. While AAPI neighborhoods were the first to suffer, we will not be the last to recover.┬а We are a group of community based organizations representing the diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community of New York City and partnering together to develop a plan to ensure the long-term recovery of the individuals, families, small businesses, and institutions of our neighborhoods. The AAPI community is the fastest growing racial group in New York, making up 15% of the City and 10% of the State. While AAPIs have the highest rate of poverty in New York City, less than 1.5% of the CityтАЩs human services contract dollars go to our community. We remind New Yorkers that this is a public health issue, not a racial, ethnic, or immigrant issue. Unfortunately, prior to the GovernorтАЩs Executive Order to put New York State on PAUSE in late March, AAPI businesses were already struggling from COVID-19, threatening the livelihoods of workers and business owners since January. Unemployment claims by AAPIs have spiked 6,900%, by far the largest percentage increase experienced by any racial group. AAPI community members continue to report increased incidents of public assaults, harassment, and hate crimes. Despite these challenges, AAPIs are serving on the front lines, risking their own health as doctors, nurses, human services workers, early childhood teachers, grocers, delivery workers, and more. While these are tough fiscal times, we call on the State and City to make smart investments that not only address the immediate need for economic relief but also revitalize neighborhood economies. We also call on the City and State to find equitable ways to raise revenue as opposed to focusing only on budget cuts. We offer the following recommendations тАУ which should be implemented in combination тАУ to ensure that while AAPI neighborhoods were the first to suffer, we will not be the last to recover.

Kamala Harris, D-California, spoke April 30 at an event organized by the AAPI Victory Fund. The Indian American U.S. senator chastised President Donald Trump for not paying attention to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small Asian American businesses. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images file photo)┬а Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, spoke April 30 at an event organized by the AAPI Victory Fund. The Indian American U.S. senator chastised President Donald Trump for not paying attention to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small Asian American businesses. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images file photo) The Trump Administration has failed small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic by not overseeing funds distributed through the first rounds of stimulus relief, said California Senator Kamala Harris April 30. Speaking via Zoom at an event organized by the AAPI Victory Fund, the Indian American Democratic U.S. senator said: тАЬTwo million Asian Americans are being impacted profoundly. The Trump Administration failed to get money to the real small businesses.тАЭ Indian American small businesses have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and few have received federal stimulus funds. (See earlier story: https://bit.ly/2Wbw6xc) The Paycheck Protection Program was voted in by Congress to give relief to mom and pop businesses who have had to shut down as shelter-in-place orders were mandated across much of the nation. The program has been heavily criticized for its lack of oversight: larger small businesses, including those backed by venture capital and hotel and restaurant chains with fewer than 500 employees at each location, scooped up the majority of the funds, and decimated the $349 relief effort in less than two weeks. Loans were given to companies who had prior relationships with banks. Banks themselves made $10 billion servicing the loans. In the next round of funding through the CARES Act 3 federal stimulus package, $60 billion has been set aside for distribution through community banks. Harris said at the briefing that she is advocating for a next round of funding for businesses with fewer than 20 employees. тАЬAAPI small businesses do not have lines of credit and they have no existing relationships with banks,тАЭ said the junior senator, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last fall, despite a stellar start. She urged small business owners to connect with their local congressional offices, which have designated staff members to help constituents get through the loan application process. Harris joined several Democratic senators who sent a letter April 27 to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza to тАЬdevelop strong supervisory mechanismsтАЭ to identify fraud in the disbursement of CARES Act loans. тАЬIt is critical that the funding provided by Congress be used to provide loans to the businesses whose owners and employeesтАЩ livelihoods are truly at risk as a result of the pandemic. Unfortunately, reports indicate that the distribution of the initial round of funding was not limited to struggling small businesses who truly needed the money to remain in operation,тАЭ wrote the senators. Harris has also introduced a bill, with Rep. Ayanna Presley, D-Massachusetts, in the House, known as the тАШThe Saving Our Street Act.тАЩ The bill provides grants of up to $250,000 to neighborhood and micro businesses during the COVID-19 crisis. The bill was introduced May 6, and supported by several ethnic community leaders. тАЬThe Saving Our Street Act helps small, local businesses keep their lights on and their workers on the job,тАЭ said Harris, introducing the measure. The AAPI Victory Fund briefing focused on the rise in racism against the Asian American community in the wake of the pandemic. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, said at the briefing that President Donald Trump has fanned the flames of racism, calling COVID-19 the тАЬChinese virus.тАЭ Lieu said the community has been relegated to тАЬsecond class citizens who are not Americans.тАЭ Asian Americans are on the frontlines of the pandemic, serving in many capacities, including health care and the production and delivery of food and necessary supplies, said Lieu, yet they fear being harassed. He noted his own parents, who have been afraid to leave their home since the pandemic began. The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council has created an online portal in several languages for reporting hate crimes related to COVID-19. The database had collected more than 1,500 reports, said Lieu. Your comment has been submitted.┬а Reported There was a problem reporting this. Log In Keep it Clean.

3759,The Sound of Music and Being Asian American,"My eight-year old daughter tried out for a mainstage theater production of The Sound of Music. She worked so hard and got close enough to taste victory, but in the end, she didnтАЩt get the part. It was her first real brush with crushing disappointment. So we talked about having faith in GodтАЩs flawless plans, being patient for perfect timings, and appreciating the value of new experiences. I repeated the mantra we had been living by since the onset:: the journey is as important as the outcome. She devoured it all, searching for the comfort that comes from a motherтАЩs words. I held her tender heart aloft with all the good sentiments I could muster that night as she lay in bed, sad but eventually soothed. Just as I was winding down and ready to leave her room, I watched her eyebrows furrow. Then she stated simply тАЬmaybe itтАЩs because IтАЩm Asian.тАЭ Oof. DidnтАЩt see that one coming. I had squealed in delight when I first learned of the auditions for The Sound of Music at one of our favorite theaters. My daughter is a musical theater student and like me, has loved the original movie starring Julie Andrews since she was five years old. She could not get enough of the singing and the choreography. When she was in Kindergarten, she brought the DVD to school and begged her teacher to show the movie during a party day. About a month into working on her audition pieces, it suddenly dawned on me that my daughter was Asian American. ItтАЩs true. I often forget what we look like to the rest of the world. тАЬHow will this work?тАЭ I asked my husband. тАЬCould they cast one Asian kid and no other ethnic kids?тАЭ My husband thought it was absurd to even worry about. тАЬItтАЩs the age of Hamilton!тАЭ he said. He was right. In recent years we have seen more diversity in the media, buoying our spirits. Over the course of the weeks and months before the actual audition and subsequent call back {go girl!}, I steeled my daughter for disappointment because thatтАЩs just how I mother. I told her that sometimes, a show needs someone taller or shorter. Sometimes, they need someone who sings in a certain range and sounds a certain way. Sometimes, weтАЩre just not better than the other singer, or dancer, or actor. We can only do our best. But when she, a relatively sheltered 8-year-old, questioned herself with the same five words that have run through my head countless times in my life, it was my turn to be sad. If she starts to think this way now, sheтАЩll handicap herself. But if I ignore the real fact that she will be viewed negatively at some point in her life because of her race, then she will go into the world naive and vulnerable.┬а Last year while driving home from school, my daughter asked whether she was black or white. That day, a girl she plays with at recess announced that white people are more powerful than black people. In an effort to get her own way, she then pronounced my daughter black {presumably because she is not white}. Oh the things I wanted to say in response! I restrained myself and the conversation that followed was complicated. I, too, am still learning what it means to be neither black nor white in America. But on this disappointing night, I would not let her believe that her race is a deterrent to her success, even if sheтАЩs already been given that message by society. тАЬI wonder if itтАЩs because IтАЩm Asian.тАЭ I took a breath and replied, тАЬNo, of course not.тАЭ * Soothed once again, she was finally ready to drift off to sleep. I left her room, hoping that these thoughts are merely part of the way she is processing the disappointment of the day. Maybe she was just re-interpreting what I had said about physical characteristics. Possibly she was only trying to delay my exit from her room. I wonтАЩt fret about it now, as long as she is not poisoning her own spirit with labels that limit her imagination. May is Asian Pacific Heritage month. I was pleasantly surprised that one of my daughterтАЩs assignments this week included a lesson using a book by Asian American author Grace Lin, who was recognized as a Champion of Change for Asian American and Pacific Islander Art and Storytelling. But this doesnтАЩt help me in addressing all the conflict that will come up as an Asian American mom raising children in an imperfect society. I did not grow up in a family that talked about these issues so I donтАЩt have a model to go by.┬а The only thing I know to do is keep an open dialogue in our family about race, and not just ours. Every Black History Month since my oldest started Kindergarten, at least one of the kids will come home with questions and thoughts about the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. I am so grateful for the teachers that diligently teach on this topic so that I have a place to begin the conversation. IтАЩve also learned that I have to educate my own kids on this subject. Right before the quarantine began, I picked up several childrenтАЩs books from the library including History of American Immigration by Peter Hammerschmidt and Chinese Immigrants in America by Kelley Hunsicker. I make note of essays and articles that I come across that may be helpful to the kids one day. When we canтАЩt find the words to express ourselves, we can sometimes find someone who is able to do it for us. The Korean American actor John Cho wrote this spot-on op-ed last month titled тАЬCoronavirus Reminds Asian Americans Like Me That Our Belonging Is ConditionalтАЭ. Recently my brother alerted me to a special 5-hour series on PBS starting May 11 called simply Asian Americans. My DVR is set to record. We have a complicated relationship with the Asian American label, but I will not let it be a shackle on me, on my sons, or on my daughter. Like the Reverend Mother sings in our timeless and beloved The Sound of Music, I will encourage them to тАЬClimb every mountain, forge every stream, follow every rainbow, till you find your dream.тАЭ {*For the record, I love and have great respect for that theater. It is led by wonderful people who in recent seasons have made a herculean effort through their art to confront hard topics like race and inequality in society.} ┬а Great thoughts and beautifully written!

3805,Film Independent Presents... Eight Great Films from Up-and-Coming Asian American Filmmakers - Film Independent,"Tags: Lists Presents Wed 5.20.2020 by Jennifer Wilson Along with our new virtual screening room, Film Independent Presents continues to recommend great stuff to watch, with weekly streaming video playlists curated by Film Independent Senior Programmer Jenn Wilson. *** For this weekтАЩs Film Independent Presents streaming video playlist and in honor of Asian and Pacific Islander American Heritage month, weтАЩre excited to highlight eight wonderful films by Asian American filmmakers Enjoy! WeтАЩre kicking off with ColumbusтАФa three-time Film Independent Spirit Award nominee for Best Cinematography, Best First Feature, and Best First Screenplay. Celebrated video essayist KoganadaтАЩs extremely accomplished feature debut stars Haley Lu Richardson and John Cho as two young people stuck in Columbus, IN for different reasons. In another movie, the two would be a quirky couple, but ChoтАЩs real mission turns out to be as a surrogate mentor for Richardson, whose real growth can only start by leaving Columbus and her co-dependent mother. Oh Lucy! (a Spirit Award nominee for Best Female Lead and Best First Feature) is one of the most surprising dark comedies to emerge from the indie film scene in years. It stars Japanese actress Shinobu Terajima in an amazing performance as Setsuko, a bored Japanese woman who gets tricked into taking an English class and ends up falling for the instructor (Josh Hartnett, also wonderful in this film.) When SetsukoтАЩs niece ends up running off to the US with Hartnett, she and her sister fly to the US to find the couple. Winner of the Berlin Film Festival Panorama Audience Award, 37 SecondsтАФby Film Independent Directing Lab and Screenwriting Lab Fellow HikariтАФstars Mei Kayama in a winning performance as Yuma, a young graphic artist with cerebral palsy who lives with her mother. Tired of the sheltered life sheтАЩs been living, she applies for a job drawing for an erotic magazine. But when the manager finds out sheтАЩs never actually had sex, she recommends that Yuma should go out and get some real-life experience first. Undeterred, Yuma sets out to do just that. A winner of the 2017 John Cassavetes Award, Andrew AhnтАЩs terrific debut feature Spa Night tells the story of a young Korean-American man who takes a job working in one of the LAтАЩs Korean bath houses to help out his family who is struggling with money. When he starts spending more time at the spa, he discovers a hidden world of gay sex and unexpressed desire. Ahn is a multiple-time Film Independent Fellow, having participated in the Directing Lab, Screenwriting Lab and Project Involve. When filmmaker Grace Lee discovered how common her own name was among Asian American women, she also discovered the nameтАЩs association with the stereotype of the тАЬgoodтАЭ Asian. As an experiment, she decided to document her investigation into this phenomenon in the film The Grace Lee Project, searching for other Grace Lees across the country to see whether or not all the other GraceтАЩs fit into this mode. The result is a fascinating journey into Asian American female identity. James SweeneyтАЩs Straight Up tells the story of a male/female couple, Rory and Todd, who meet and discover theyтАЩre soulmates. EverythingтАЩs great exceptтАж Todd is gay. Hard as they try to defy sexuality and have a love affair of the brain and heart instead of one thatтАЩs physical, the two struggle to make things work. SweeneyтАЩs incredibly smart dialogue will make you root for this odd but extremely engaging couple. Ash MayfairтАЩs The Third Wife, a 2020 Spirit Awards nominee for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and the Someone To Watch Award, tells the story of a 19th century Vietnamese girl, May, who becomes the third wife of a wealthy landowner. MayтАЩs only job is to be obedient and produce a male heir for her husbandтАЩs estate, but life becomes complicated for her when she delivers a daughter instead of a sonтАФand finds herself attracted to one of her sister-wives. The Third Wife is an assured debut with lush cinematography and top-notch performances. Rahul JainтАЩs 2016 documentary Machines announced him as a major new filmmaking voice to follow. Set in a gigantic textile factory in Gujarat, India, the camera documents the rhythmic and relentlessly dehumanizing physical labor and intense hardship faced by the people who work here. The film is so visually stunning, that its often easy to forget that what weтАЩre watching is the very hard to reconcile existence of the pre-industrial working conditions of humans being treated like machines.

3818,How to be an ally for Asian Americans facing racism amid COVID-19 ├втВмтАЭ Sahan Journal,"Sahan Journal is a nonprofit newsroom that published authentic news by and about Minnesota's immigrants and communities of colorтАФthe kind of stories you wonтАЩt find anywhere else. Get them in your inbox. ┬а Sahan Journal A nonprofit newsroom dedicated to reporting on MinnesotaтАЩs immigrant and refugee communities. Sahan Journal tells the stories of Minnesota's immigrants and communities of color that no one else is telling. To receive a weekly email with a roundup of our stories, sign up for our free newsletter. ┬а This story comes to you from MPR News, a partner with Sahan Journal. We will be sharing stories between SahanJournal.com and MPRNews.org. As the coronavirus has continued spreading across the United States, so too has the false belief that Asian Americans are to blame for the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials are investigating reports of name-calling to denial of services that Minnesotans of Asian descent have been experiencing. And as Minnesota eases up on restrictions on daily life тАФ and everything from schools to shopping malls begin to reopen тАФ some Asian American community members fear these incidents will only increase. MPR News reached out to a historian and community leaders and asked for their advice for non-Asian Americans to become allies to their peers during this difficult time. All four respondents were part of an MPR virtual town hall on racism during COVID-19, which you can watch here. Here are their written tips for being an ally. тАЬThe most important thing we can do in this moment is to understand, acknowledge, and relearn our American history of racism. WhatтАЩs happening now to Asian Americans is not new. Instead of allyship, we need to be in unity against racism. Being in unity means we donтАЩt let communities stand or solve the problem alone; instead, we collectively call out interpersonal and systemic acts of racialized violence. There is always something we can on our own and something we can do together. Ending racism takes everyone.тАЭ тАЬLead with love: be intentional about letting people know that they are welcome and valued. If you see discrimination or hate, speak up! You can also report discrimination and bias to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights by calling 1-833-454-0148.тАЭ Want more? Get news and stories that illuminate the lives and experiences of MinnesotaтАЩs immigrants and communities of color. ┬а Lee said she intends her tip to apply for both allies and victims of racism: тАЬWe all need to understand how anti-Asian xenophobia is just one example of how the pandemic is disproportionately impacting poor, African American, Latinx, Asian American, and indigenous communities; groups that were already vulnerable to economic inequality, health disparities, and social exclusion. We need to support each other in order to move forward together.тАЭ тАЬHate and racist acts against Asian Americans have been on the rise due to COVID 19. And like all acts of hate, it cannot be left unchallenged. Speak out against these acts at any given chance. Teachers and people who work with youth, especially, have a very important role to play. If this is your line of work, use the opportunity to teach and equip youth with healthy ways to respond to hate. Even if you donтАЩt have Asian students in your class, the wrongful acts of these events need to be called out. Bias and hate need to be dispelled. The biggest barrier for Asian Americans is the constant invisibility and silencing forced upon them. Asian American issues are American issues. More platforms need to be given to highlight this American story. The Asian American story needs to be heard and a united effort needs to be put forth to illuminate the contributions of Asian Americans throughout history.тАЭ May is Mental Health Awareness Month.

As I learned more about engineering, I realized what a good match it was for my methodical approach to things. Believe it or not, it was my own fear. When I first started in my career, I was afraid to disagree with others, either because they might get angry at me or because I might be wrong. Over time, I learned to trust my instincts, and speak up. If they got mad at me, so what? As long as I was objective and factual, it wasnтАЩt about them personally. I gained confidence in my knowledge and experience, and knew that even if I was wrong, that my position was made to the best of my ability, and it could be an opportunity to learn. Early in my career, I experienced more adversity based on my age than my gender or ethnicity. I still experience it to some degree today, since I look younger than my actual age. I have experienced comments such as тАЬIтАЩve never worked for an Asian beforeтАЭ and тАЬI didnтАЩt know that you were AsianтАЭ (thanks to the increasingly virtual world that we work in across the country and world) like it was going to be a factor in how things would be moving forward. For the most part, I have been lucky to have co-workers and managers who believe that my gender or ethnicity does not affect my performance. The friendships! My closest friends (who are also my most trusted advisors) are all people IтАЩve met through SWE. No matter what personal or professional problem I may be facing, I know that there is someone in my SWE network who I can turn to for help, advice, or a sympathetic ear. I have several SWE friends who no longer are local (or never were), but we make an effort to see each other whenever possible, whether it be at the annual conference or elsewhere. What may have once been a solo business trip dinner becomes a time to catch up over good food and wine! I have often suffered from Imposter Syndrome because I have spent my career in quality, supply chain, and operations, and never worked for the engineering organization at my company despite having an engineering degree. My engineering training provides me with a methodical approach to problem-solving the many challenges that present themselves and allows me to understand the more technical problems in order to offer better solutions or calculate the impact on my work. I rely on my ability to work cross-functionally more than my technical abilities, most days.┬а Upekesha Addagatla Ngugi is a Flight Controls Design Engineer at The Boeing Company. She was born in Hyderabad, India and moved to Dallas, Texas during high school. Mentoring, networking, SWE leadership roles have played a key role in her professional development and helped her empower future women in STEM. I was born and raised in Hyderabad, India. I emigrated to Dallas, Texas, USA as a high school student. My father is an engineer and encouraged us to pursue a technical career. Due to the competitiveness in India, engineering or medicine were always my two choices. The choice of medicine was out because I knew I didnтАЩt want to deal with blood. I enjoyed math and programming classes in high school. During a family trip to the NASA Space Center in Houston, TX we got to see the X-38 vehicle up close and participated in a teleconference with astronauts in space at the time. This led me to choose a career in Aerospace Engineering. Indian women are taught to be humble, and not question men or elders. This has been one of the biggest obstacles I had to overcome in my career. Thankfully, I had role models and mentors at work and through SWE that helped me realize that this behavior didnтАЩt serve me well in the workplace. They helped me learn when to be humble, when to advocate for myself, and when to respectfully speak up to do the right thing for the project. As a Flight Controls Design Engineer, I perform complex fluids analysis and create designs in CATIA to meet given requirements. CATIA is a software used to model 3D designs through computer-aided engineering. I enjoy the challenge of finding solutions to create a design to meet difficult requirements. Seeing an airplane I worked on fly for the first time and visiting the factory to see parts I work on are exciting things I look forward to. The walks on the massive Everett factory floor truly make you feel small. IтАЩve been fortunate to have a variety of experiences working with airline customers, various engineering groups, suppliers, and regulatory agencies. Since I work in the Aerospace Industry, I am usually the only Indian woman in the room. I didnтАЩt expect this and was surprised to see this when I started working. I learned to network with people of various cultural backgrounds through my interest in cooking and traveling. The SWE network of over 40,000 women, especially the affinity group members, that are going through similar situations helps me make connections I donтАЩt normally have an opportunity to. One of the good surprises is that my problem-solving skills translate at home to activities I enjoy like assembling furniture and replacing electrical switches. I like to volunteer with SWE because it is a good way for me to network with other women engineers since I donтАЩt see as many at work every day. Since I discovered the value of SWE and other similar organizations later in my career, I continue to mentor early-career engineers, collegiate and K-12 students so that I can be a role model that I didnтАЩt have. Closing the gender and cultural gaps in the STEM industry are reasons that motivate me to contribute more. Volunteering as a FIRST robotics mentor and similar volunteering experiences help me practice my engineering skills and learn more about 3D printers, mills, lathes, and other manufacturing techniques.┬а Kristine is currently a senior at Drexel University pursuing her BS in Chemical Engineering and her MS in Materials Science and Engineering. She will be attending the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in Fall 2020 for her PhD in Chemical Engineering. Her passion for improving diversity and inclusion in STEM leads to her heavy involvement in the Society of Women Engineers on the collegiate and Societal levels. In her free time, she loves to try out new air fryer recipes. I was born and raised in Hialeah, Florida, a small town near Miami with less than 1% Asian population. In school, I always loved math and science, so engineering felt like a natural career for me. It wasnтАЩt until I actually took engineering classes in high school through the Project Lead the Way program that I really understood what engineering was. I tried mechanical and electrical engineering and it didnтАЩt really fit. I wasnтАЩt enjoying what I was learning, but I still liked the problem-solving aspect. When we learned about manufacturing, it was the first time I could see myself as an engineer. This led me to choose chemical engineering as my major in college. I decided to add a masterтАЩs degree in materials science and engineering to my course of study because I wanted to understand why materials behave the way they do. My biggest obstacle has been myself. Growing up, my parents always stressed the importance of humility. No one likes an arrogant person, so I was taught to always be humble no matter what I accomplished. However, this manifested in me denying my success and pushing down my feelings of validation. I struggled with a lot of self-doubt and imposter syndrome throughout college to the point where I felt like I didnтАЩt deserve what I had done; I was just lucky. Perfection didnтАЩt seem like enough for me. Through counseling and self-compassion workshops, IтАЩve grown to embrace my hard work and learn that I am good enough just the way I am. Different facets of my identity get pinpointed depending on my environment. During my internships, people made more comments about my ethnicity. At my first internship, I got called the names of the three other Asian women in the company. One person said that we looked the same from behind, even though we all had different hair colors. In the classroom, my professors and peers seem to treat me differently because IтАЩm a woman, not because of my heritage. On the bright side, IтАЩve been able to use my identity to educate others about my perspectives. At my last internship, I introduced my coworkers to Lunar New Year and was able to make a product based off the holiday. I joined SWE during my freshman year at Drexel. Even before I got to college, I knew I wanted to join SWE because I was usually one of the only girls in my high school engineering classes. I was really excited to join an organization where I wouldnтАЩt be the only one. I became the K-12 Outreach Chair just three months after I got to college and moved my way up to president by my third year. I didnтАЩt grow up with mentors in STEM and I knew I wanted to be that person for other young engineers. I love sharing with K-12 students why I chose to be an engineer. I like to call SWE my cheer squad. Even when I felt like I didnтАЩt deserve success or praise, SWE was there to cheer me on. The SWE community is one of the main reasons IтАЩve stayed in engineering. IтАЩve met some of my closest friends through my involvement in SWE. IтАЩve also met some of the most inspiring mentors and I hope to be the same type of mentor someday. Because of the opportunities and experiences I got through SWE, IтАЩve grown so much as a leader, an engineer, and a person overall. I donтАЩt think I can choose just one great thing that SWE has done for me.

4274,Between the Notes: Jordan Hwang brings the Taipei Music Academy & Festival to Austin Asian American Film Festival,"Written by Vivienne Chang The film begins with the universal cues of an orchestral warm up: a retrieved violin bow, the tell-tale crisp sleeves and cuff links of performance attire, the scrambling annotations, the conductorтАЩs swelling flourish. This could be anywhere, until we catch glimpses of something cheerfully familiar, locating us in the heart of Taiwan: the interior of a double-decker bus (equipped with karaoke screens), a cup of bubble tea. HwangтАЩs recent documentary Between the Notes, now playing at the Austin Asian American Film Festival, explores the world of classical music in Taiwan. It follows the stories of four musicians training with the Taipei Music Academy & Festival as they tackle their doubts head-on to achieve their dreams of a successful music career. Although the students come from different backgrounds тАУ UCLA, Julliard, and The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University тАУ they all strive to improve their craft. Between the Notes is a refreshing take on classical music: a narrative not just about playing the notes, but the expression and journey in between the notes that makes a piece of music come alive. I had the opportunity to speak to Hwang about his experience in creating Between the Notes. Vivienne Chang: Hi Jordan! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today and congratulations on being selected for the Austin Asian American Film Festival. Jordan Hwang: Thank you! IтАЩm excited to be here. Chang: Before we dive into the film, I am curious to learn a little bit about you. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you got into filmmaking? Hwang: Yeah, so I grew up in Houston in a predominantly Asian American community. One of the first passions I had was in wushu, a form of martial arts, which I started practicing at the age of five. In fact, I attended the Pan-American (Wushu) World Championships and won three golds in high school. Practicing wushu taught me not only the importance of working hard, but also this idea of flow. There are a lot of choreographic elements and timing-based movements in the art form and so this flow eventually led to my understanding of pacing in film and storytelling. During that time, I was also watching a lot of YouTube and witnessing the rise of Asian American presence on the platform from channels such as Wong Fu Productions and KevJumba. Their content inspired me because even though they did not have the traditional means of media, such as movies and television, to showcase their work on, they were able to use YouTube to directly connect with their audience. They showed me that I had the ability to go out and create, which is why I pursued filmmaking. Chang: When I think about Taiwan, classical music is not necessarily the first thing that comes to mind. How did you become aware of the Taipei Music Academy & Festival and why did you ultimately decide to portray it? Hwang: It stemmed from my meeting with Cho-Liang Lin who is a world-class classical violinist who has performed with many professional orchestras across the world. He wanted to create opportunities for rising musicians to train in an advance classical music program in his home country in Taiwan. From there he founded the Taipei Music Academy & Festival. After I met Lin, he gave me a lot of freedom in terms of the stories I could tell of the festival. I could have focused on the masters and teachers who are world-class artists who came to Taiwan to teach, but I wanted to place the attention on the students who had such high potential for growth. Chang: How did you get connected with the four students that were portrayed in the film? Hwang: There were a lot of students at the academy, so in the first week [the entire crew and I] kind of hung around the students to get to know them a little better. But it soon became apparent the people we were going to portray because of their unique personalities and passion for music. Pi Wei, the youngest of the four, had this pure motivation inside him, which derived from wanting to make his parents proud. Katherine Woo had such a strong communication style that allowed her to be a great leader (her quintet ultimately won best in show in the festival). Everett Kelly seemed a little lost in the festival, but he was determined to find his own sound. And finally, Angela Wee had this honest tenacity in her that was very inspiring to witness. Chang: In the making of this documentary, were there any challenges or funny stories that you met? Hwang: In the beginning of the process, my crew and I were not quite sure how to approach telling this story. However, after a week in Taiwan, we received a hurricane warning which would mean that classes and thus the progression of our filmmaking process would have to pause for a day. We decided to hang out with a couple of students at the food court of Taipei 101. It was great to see them outside this professional classical music environment and we got to be fast friends through this interaction. As the process grew, we would often go out to eat with the cast and crew at local night markets and visit Taiwanese arcades. This was such a great experience because we were able to immerse ourselves into the community, meeting new friends on the way. Chang: What do you hope the viewers take away from the film? Hwang: I hope for the viewers to see an intimate perspective on the thought process that students go through to become professional musicians. They know that this journey is not easy, but they love what they do, and this is a dream worth chasing. Chang: If you had to offer advice to anyone seeking a career in a creative or artistic field, what would that be? Hwang: If you want it bad enough, go for it. If you have the internet, there are actually not many limitations stopping you. A lot of people worry about not having a film degree, but there are a lot of free education and resources out there to help you in continuing to add to your skill set. For example, right now I am learning about 3D visual effects. Also, if you do not have a professional camera, your phone is pretty good too! Chang: Thank you so much for sitting with me today, Jordan. But before you go, would love to ask you some quick (and very important) question! Hwang: Sure, IтАЩm glad to be here! Favorite Taiwanese Film тАУ Life of Pi. It doesnтАЩt have a storyline relating to Taiwan, but it was shot there, and the cinematography is beautiful. Favorite Asian American Film тАУ Crazy Rich Asians. A truly transcendent film. Favorite Taiwanese Food тАУ Lamb Noodle Soup.

4441,'Keyboard warriors with cheap internet': Saloni Gaur aka Nazma Aapi on critics accusing her of appropriating a Muslim identity,"By Oshin Fernandes Have you come across the videos of a woman wearing a make-shift chador-burqa and greeting ""Assalamualaikum Instagram Ke Bandon""? Saloni Gaur, a 20-year-old comedian from Uttar Pradesh is making waves on social media for her brainchild тАШNazma AapiтАЩ. The avatar of a fierce and opinionated Muslim woman, who doesnтАЩt shy away even from catapulting jokes at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Who is Nazma Aapi? тАЬIt was around Eid in 2018, when I first thought of this character,тАЭ says Saloni who simply wanted to make a video on preparations around the festival, and thought it would be more relatable if she conveyed it as Muslim woman. She maintains that the character is not inspired by anyone in particular. тАЬMy father has a lot of Muslim friends and they generally speak in the dialect, also used by people in Old Delhi, which I grew up listening to,тАЭ she adds.

She has also conducted a microscopic series around the coronavirus pandemic in India. These include her views on the lockdown, employees working from home, online lectures, panic buying and violence against healthcare workers. And while the cr├иme de la cr├иme would think twice before weighing in on these subjects, Saloni has brilliantly encapsulated them in her canon of jokes, fired on virtual platforms. She says, тАЬEarlier, when I had just thousand followers it was more of an improv. But now that a lot of people are watching my videos I have to be a little more responsible of what I say. I pick up the topic first and then I think of the character, which would be most suitable to address that issue. Then, I think about it from that character's point of view.тАЭ The 20-year-old is watchful of the way she projects her punch lines. She asserts that not every burning topic should be turned into comedy. тАЬIf I think that the topic is very serious, and won't be able to pull it off without hurting a lot of people, I won't do it.тАЭ Nazma Aapi on Corona virus.

Not to mention the casual misogyny and sexism under the garb of тАЬconstructive criticismтАЭ or тАЬfeedbackтАЭ, and being touted as someone exploiting a Muslim womanтАЩs attire to sell humour; this is just the beginning. Gaur says the best way to deal with trolls is to not deal with them at all. She says, тАЬPeople are filled up with rage, which sometimes comes out on the wrong person. I don't care about them. What matters to me, is that IтАЩm honest in my work. These are just keyboard warriors with cheap internet.тАЭ As for Nazma Aapi, тАЬThere are a lot of Muslim comedians who also play Hindu characters, and I see no harm in it. I find it equally funny. ItтАЩs quite normal for me,тАЭ she adds. SaloniтАЩs talent has grabbed eyeballs of Bollywood celebs and filmmakers too. She says, тАЬItтАЩs all new for me.тАЭ тАЬPeople say that I have become a celeb now because of the numbers they see on social media but nothing has changed in my life. I am still worried about my online exams. My parents get excited only when they see me on TV or in the newspaper.

When asked about her backup plan if she hadnтАЩt succeeded as a comedian, Saloni states, тАЬIf this wouldnтАЩt have gone in the right direction then IтАЩd be preparing for the banking exams, because that's what my mother wanted me to do.тАЭ WhatтАЩs next after the lockdown? тАЬI don't have any plans as such. But the first thing I would do is to go back to my hostel, grab my stuff and leave, because I came home before lockdown with no books and just two pair of clothes.тАЭ (To receive our E-paper on whatsapp daily, please click here.

4508,Rate of covid fatalities in India less than 12: PM Modi tells AAPI,"Thursday, Jul 08, 2021 | Last Update : 09:08 PM IST Modi said India has performed much better in the fight against the coronavirus India's fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic is driven by its people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, attributing the success against the contagion to the implementation of the nationwide lockdown in its initial phase. In an address during the virtual meeting of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) on Saturday, Modi said that the COVID-19 had been used as an opportunity to work towards making the country self-reliant.┬а This is for the first time that an Indian prime minister addressed the annual meeting of the AAPI, a representative body of more than 80,000 Indian-American doctors in the US. Sharing the statistics of various countries, Modi said India has performed much better in the fight against the coronavirus. ""As against the death rate of 350 individuals per million in the US and over 600 per million in European nations like the UK, Italy and Spain, the rate of fatalities in India is less than 12,"" he said. ""Uttar Pradesh has been remarkably successful in fighting against the coronavirus,"" Modi said. ""And same is the case with several other states as well.""┬а The prime minister attributed this to the support from the people of the country. ""Rural parts of the country have largely remained untouched from this pandemic,"" he said. Without people's cooperation, Modi said, the success would not have been possible in the world's second-highest populated country -- with high density, where social gathering is a norm of life, large religious and political gatherings and large-scale interstate migration are regular. India defied the fears of the world's topmost experts in this regard, according to Modi. India has been able to save the lives of thousands and lakhs of its citizens because of the timely lockdown, he told the Indian-American physicians.┬а Modi said the COVID-19 pandemic has been used as an opportunity to improve the healthcare facilities. ""For instance, at the start of the coronavirus, there was only one COVID-19 testing lab. Now there are 1,000, he said. The prime minister underlined that India, which imported most of its Personnel Protection Equipment (PPE) kits at the start of the pandemic, was now almost self-reliant and in a position to export them. The country is making more than 30 lakh N95 masks per week. More than 50,000 new ventilators are being made available to the healthcare sector, all made inside the country, he added. Modi said he was proud of the achievements and contribution of the Indian-origin physicians across the world in the battle against the COVID-19.┬а India's ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu echoed the prime minister and said the early lockdown has helped delay the spread of the deadly virus and save lives. Appreciating the role of the Indian-American doctors during the COVID-19, Sandhu said: ""You are the real heroes who have risked your lives and have been out to assist others."" There is a widespread recognition of their contributions in the US, he added. ┬а ┬а Mathura court dismisses Krishna Janmabhoomi petition From October 15, multiplexes and cinemas can reopen with 50% seating capacity Shane Warne confident that Sanju will make Team India if he keeps playing like he does this IPL Natarajan's yorkers hit the spot, and his life story strikes a chord Rashid dedicates his Man of the Match performance to his late mother тАФ his biggest fan Copyright ┬й 2016 - 2021 The Asian Age.

4531,Nielsen Discusses Programming and Gaming in Asian American Diverse Intelligence Series,"As we are already in Asian American Heritage Month, the amount of content from the community has expanded in different mediums over the years and continues to grow. Nielsen, the global marketing leader in media analysis and viewership, commemorated the occasion with the launch of the Asian American Diverse Intelligence Series. The new initiative started with their first panel, Engaging Asian American Consumers at the Dawn of a New Decade. Led by Mariko Carpenter, the companyтАЩs VP of Strategic Community Alliances, the event touched on how Asian American-led TV programs, social media, and gaming has grown and represents new opportunities to reach consumers in the US. The webinar included panelists Veena Crownholm, a lifestyle host and content creator, as well as Christine Cadena, VP of Diversity and Inclusion at Walt Disney as they both talked about the growth of Asian American-led programs and their effects to the US market. During the panel, Carpenter discussed the growing trend of digital platforms and influencers in the US market being led by Asian Americans. By the use of social media, the Asian American-led programs are growing in popularity as viewers remain engaged in what is being offered in different platforms. When it comes to TV programs, comedy seems to be the selling point for Asian Americans with comedians like Hasan Minhaj or Jo Koy providing content on services like Netflix. The same goes for gaming as it caters to the younger audience with 37 percent using VR technology as well as 53 percent of the Asian American demographic are into Esports. Games like Minecraft or Pokemon Go are using this platform to cater to gamers and it makes sense as most of these are partially or fully developed by Asia. The webinar talked about how one can reach this market through social media, digital platforms, television, and events. By using the community, the Asian American market continues to evolve with the amount of content being produced thanks to creators launching their own programming to the US and to the world. We sat down with Carpenter on her thoughts about the growing content made by Asian Americans and the bright future that holds with the US market. You can check the interview right here. Mariko S.

4533,COVID-19 and Asian American Pacific Islanders,"Advertisement Part of a collection: Journal of General Internal Medicine volume 35, pages 2763тАУ2764 (2020)Cite this article 2784 Accesses 5 Citations 10 Altmetric Metrics details The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and tragic loss of life and employment have upended daily life in every community around the country. Unfortunately, Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPIs), including those of non-Chinese heritage, have additionally been subjected to COVID-19-related discrimination. On March 14th, two Burmese-American children and their father were stabbed in public by a man who тАЬthought the family was Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus.тАЭ1 On March 19th, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), a coalition of AAPI community organizations, set up a public reporting center for COVID-related discrimination. Within the first month, A3PCON received 1497 reports of COVID-19-related discrimination, from verbal harassment and being spat/coughed on to physical assault and being barred from establishments, with reported incidents 2.3 times higher for women than for men.2 Racism can cause psychosocial trauma and maladaptive coping behaviors, and worsen physical health and health inequities.3 In this viewpoint, we discuss how providers can help address AAPI racism within the physician-patient relationshipтАФespecially as general internists comprise a key position in the frontline against the pandemic. At baseline, AAPIs have the lowest utilization of mental health services due to barriers in language, insurance, and cultural understanding.4 AAPI patients may not volunteer information to their doctors, and many avoid going out, even for essential needs, due to fear of violence and marginalization in public. In the primary care setting, clinicians can begin to address these issues by taking a moment to ask тАЬHave you experienced any тАШacts of discriminationтАЩ with everything going on?тАЭ Asking about discrimination in itself is an act of care, as it demonstrates acknowledgment of the current challenges in these communities and helps establish trust. The American Psychiatric AssociationтАЩs DSM-5 Outline for Cultural Formulation notes that тАЬExperiences of racism and discrimination in the larger society may impede establishing trust and safety in the clinical diagnostic encounter. Effects may include problems eliciting symptoms, misunderstanding of the cultural and clinical significance of symptoms and behaviors, and difficulty establishing or maintaining the rapport needed for an effective clinical alliance.тАЭ Therefore, the Outline calls for the clinician to assess the cultural identity of the individual, cultural conceptualizations of distress, psychosocial stressors, and cultural features of vulnerability and resilience, and cultural features of the relationship between the individual and the clinician.5 To obtain this information, the general practitioner can use some of the 16 questions in the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview.5Assess cultural identity by asking, тАЬFor you, what are the most important aspects of your background or identity?тАЭ Assess conceptualizations of distress: тАЬWhat brings you here today?тАЭ and тАЬWhy do you think this is happening to you? What are the causes of your problem?тАЭ Similarly, assess psychosocial stressors and cultural features of vulnerability and resilience: тАЬAre there any kinds of support that make your problem better, such as support from family, friends, or others?тАЭ Determine cultural features of the relationship between the individual and the clinician: тАЬHave you been concerned about doctors and patients coming from different backgrounds and is there anything that we can do to provide you with the care you need?тАЭ The patient is our greatest teacher on their experience. Meanwhile, clinicians may find themselves as a witness observing a COVID-19-related discriminatory act against a colleague or a patient. The Confronting Prejudiced Response (CPR) Model formulates that, in overcoming obstacles to intervening as a bystander, one must recognize the prejudice, perceive it as an emergency, feel a sense of responsibility, and view the benefits as outweighing the costs.6 Although no validated intervention for COVID-19-related discrimination exists yet, bystanders may be empowered by current frameworks for bystander intervention, such as from the 4 Ds of Bystander Intervention (Distract, Delegate, Direct, Delay) adapted by the American Friends Service Committee to combat racism, to the Interrupt, Question, Acknowledge, Educate, Echo framework adapted from the Southern Poverty Law Center to promote tolerance in teaching.7 Consider the statement тАЬGet me a different nurse who does not eat bats. I donтАЩt want to get тАШKung FluтАЩтАЭ using the latter framework. In nonviolent environments where teaching is possible, Interrupt: Call attention to the fact that an aggression occurred and did not go unnoticed. тАЬLetтАЩs stop and talk about Asians eating bats giving you тАШKung FluтАЩ.тАЭ Question: Ask them to explain why the joke is funny and seek to understand their intentions. тАЬWhat made you say that?тАЭ or тАЬWhy do you think that?тАЭ Acknowledge: Validate where possible, but set limits. тАЬI understand that you are anxious about catching the virus yourself. However, I do not feel comfortable when you use a term like that.тАЭ Educate: Bridge gaps by appealing to evidence. тАЬThe virus can infect folks of any race, so we all have to do our part.тАЭ Echo: In group settings, if someone else has interrupted the bias, re-iterate the message and/or thank the first person for speaking up. While there has been an increase in the use of hashtags that encourage violence against Chinese people, there has also been a spike in anti-Semitic hashtags espousing racist tropes about the virus тАЬbeing used to kill off large portions of the population.тАЭ8 As a medical community, we must make it clear to society that the racist rhetoric of blame threatens mental health and even livesтАФas we have already seen with the stabbing of the Burmese-American family. The scapegoating of minority populations to explain a pandemic should never be acceptable. Racism is a determinant of health and should not be overlooked by clinicians. The murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor last month are just two reminders of how systemic racism is a national public health crisis. Now and when the pandemic abates, we must work to ensure that medicine as a field continues to care for all minority communities. Ramirez M.

4615,The officer who stood by as George Floyd died is Asian American. We want to speak about that.,"The picture of now-fired Hmong American police officer Tou Thao, standing together with his again turned as George Floyd died final Monday in Minneapolis police custody, has ignited a dialogue round the right way to approach the subject of anti-blackness within the Asian American group. Thao has been described by activists as a logo of Asian American complicity in anti-blackness following the loss of life of Floyd, a black man who begged for his life whereas then-officer Derek Chauvin dug his knee into his neck. ┬а Minneapolis police recognized former officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng тАФ along with Thao, who has a historical past of involvement in use-of-force incidentsтАФ as additionally being concerned in FloydтАЩs detainment. Several consultants expressed that this can be a pivotal second for Asian Americans to sort out the topic in a productive approach, starting with unpacking the biases in their very own communities by first confronting the historic context behind anti-blackness. Kabzuag Vaj, founding father of Freedom Inc., a nonprofit that goals to finish violence towards minorities, girls and the LGBTQ group, underscored the significance of acknowledging that whereas Asian Americans cope with their very own types of oppression, itтАЩs incomparable to what the black group confronts. тАЬPeople donтАЩt have a baseline of an understanding of what anti-blackness even is,тАЭ Vaj, whoтАЩs Hmong American, stated. тАЬYes, we [Asian Americans] have pain and we suffer from oppression and discrimination and racism. Black people are in a different boat. On top of that, their struggle with the police, at least in this country, has a long history of 400 years of control and occupation. I think that thatтАЩs really important for us to acknowledge that.тАЭ Tensions between the black and the Asian communities have lengthy existed. The strained relations stem, partially, from being set in opposition to at least one one other all through American historical past, Vaj stated. One of essentially the most obvious examples is the Los Angeles riots that adopted the acquittal of 4 white cops to be used of extreme pressure within the videotaped beating of Rodney King, a black building employee. Businesses sustained roughly $1 billion in injury, with roughly half being Korean-owned. Divisions between immigrant Korean enterprise house owners and their black prospects widened. The organizer, who comes from a refugee household herself, stated she will be able to look again to as just lately as her personal individualsтАЩs journey within the U.S. as proof. When America resettled Southeast Asian refugees following the Vietnam War, many have been positioned in poorly funded city areas with little infrastructure, comparable to Long Beach and Stockton, California, or the Bronx, New York, the place black and brown communities had already existed. тАЬWhen you are put into this situation, and you live amongst other poor black and brown folks with very little resources, there is that piece of strain between communities that must fight for the same resources,тАЭ Vaj stated. тАЬThere isnтАЩt enough for all of you.тАЭ Moreover, resettlement efforts didnтАЩt embody ample introductions between refugees and the communities they now inhabited, Vaj stated. The info that was fed to the brand new immigrants typically didnтАЩt humanize communities of coloration, she added. тАЬEverything youтАЩve learned, youтАЩve learned through the lens of white supremacy. And this is what this country is built on,тАЭ Vaj defined. Even now, the organizer stated sheтАЩs acquired abusive feedback and criticisms from some members of her group for standing with the black group. Ellen Wu, a historian and the writer of тАЬThe Color of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority,тАЭ overlapped a lot of VajтАЩs ideas. She famous white supremacy has traditionally consumed the exploitation and destruction of the black group. anti-Japanese movement of the early 1900s.тАЭ data-reactid=тАЭ36тА│>As Asian Americans started to arrive within the United States, white supremacy focused the group as nicely. The authorities handed racist laws just like the Chinese Exclusion Act, and fueled actions just like the anti-Japanese motion of the early 1900s. But Wu defined that as time went on, white supremacy took on different kinds. Fearing that anti-Asian racism might jeopardize the U.S.тАЩ place as a pacesetter on the world stage and impede imperial enlargement overseas, white liberals sought to dismantle Asian exclusion laws and practices throughout and after World War II. тАЬIn other words, they expected a geopolitical payoff to recognizing Asian Americans as тАШmodel citizens,тАЩтАЭ Wu stated. In the 1960s, white liberals wielded the mannequin minority stereotype to stifle black social actions, utilizing Asian Americans as тАЬproofтАЭ of meritocracy and equal alternative for individuals of coloration. As she mentions in her e book, politicians weaponized Japanese American тАЬsuccess storiesтАЭ after World War II as a tactic in reframing Japanese American incarceration and weakening the civil rights motion. Compliance with, moderately than opposition to, the state would deliver rewards, the politicians hoped to indicate. тАЬThe insinuation was that hard work along with unwavering faith in the government and liberal democracy as opposed to political protest were the keys to overcoming racial barriers as well as achieving full citizenship,тАЭ Wu wrote. The evolving types of white supremacy, Wu stated, gave Asians more room for social mobility. тАЬThese gains, however, have come at a cost: complicity with white supremacy.тАЭ #Asians4BlackLives movement from the Bay Area stood in solidarity with Black lives that same year.Other historic movements, including the farmworkers movement in the 1960s, led in part by Filipino farmworkers like the legendary Larry Itliong who, with Latinx workers, organized the historic Delano Grape Strike.тАЭ data-reactid=тАЭ43тА│>Wu famous that Asian Americans have had an advanced historical past of each mobilizing for and towards the pursuits of black and different communities of coloration. Many Chinese Americans advocated on the behalf of Peter Liang, an NYPD officer who fatally shot Akai Gurley, a 28-year-old black father, in 2014. They rallied round Liang, describing him as a scapegoat by prosecutors as an alternative of demanding justice for Gurley and others who confronted police brutality, Wu stated. Conversely, the #Asians4BlackLives motion from the Bay Area stood in solidarity with Black lives that very same yr.Other historic actions, together with the farmworkers motion within the 1960s, led partially by Filipino farmworkers just like the legendary Larry Itliong who, with Latinx staff, organized the historic Delano Grape Strike. Wu additionally clarified that Asian Americans are a various group with subgroups which have a spread of energy and privilege. Since their preliminary resettlement roughly 45 years in the past, Southeast Asians, together with Hmong, have handled the ache of impoverished neighborhoods and insufficient help underneath the backdrop of current racial injustice, Quyen Dinh, the chief director of Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, stated. Inequities linger to this present day. A report revealed by the middle confirmed that Hmong Americans have public medical insurance enrollment charges much like black Americans, at 39 p.c and 38 p.c, respectively. When taking a look at schooling, nearly 30 p.c of Southeast Asian Americans havenтАЩt accomplished highschool or handed the GED. In comparability, thatтАЩs greater than double the nationwide common at 13 p.c. тАЬWhen aggregated data lump our unique stories into the false myth of one thriving model minority, the lived experiences of entire communities are rendered invisible,тАЭ Dinh stated. тАЬThis perception dilutes and dismisses the urgent need for more resources and support for Southeast Asian American refugee communities, and it hides the systemic barriers our families have been forced to overcome for the last 45 years.тАЭ Other advocates admitted that anti-blackness is a crucial however uncomfortable matter for a lot of in the neighborhood to crack open. Deepa Iyer, writer of тАЬWe Too Sing America; South Asian, Arab, Muslim and Sikh Immigrants Shape Our Multiracial FutureтАЭ and racial justice advocate, stated Asian Americans ought to interrogate the affect of policing and incarceration on communities of coloration and black communities particularly. Research shows that for black men, there is a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the course of their lifetimes. In comparison, the average lifetime odds of being killed by police in the general population are an estimated 1 in 2,000 for men and roughly 1 in 33,000 for women.тАЭ data-reactid=тАЭ48тА│>Research exhibits that for black males, thereтАЩs a 1 in 1,000 probability of being killed by police over the course of their lifetimes. In comparability, the common lifetime odds of being killed by police within the common inhabitants are an estimated 1 in 2,000 for males and roughly 1 in 33,000 for girls. тАЬLetтАЩs not forget that state violence in the United States has affected Asian Americans too,тАЭ Iyer stated. Sureshbhai Patel, was slammed to the ground and left partially paralyzed by Alabama officer Eric Parker during a visit to his sonтАЩs family.тАЭ data-reactid=тАЭ50тА│>She identified that in 2006, a Minneapolis police officer Jason Andersen shot and killed a 19-year-old Hmong American Fong Lee who had been driving a motorcycle with associates.

4646,Abstract PR03: Disaggregation of gastric cancer risk Between Asian American subgroups,"Advanced Search Advanced Search Introduction: Within the United States (US), Asian/Pacific Islanders (APIs) are at increased risk for non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (NCGA) compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Previous epidemiologic research has treated APIs as an aggregated group for analysis; however, substantial genetic and environmental differences may exist within subgroups. Very limited data exist regarding gastric cancer epidemiology as stratified by API subgroup. Methods: All incident cases of NCGA diagnosed in the years 2000-2014 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program registries incorporating California, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Atlanta, and New Jersey. API subgroup of patients was identified: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Indian. API subgroup population estimates were obtained from the American Community Survey. The age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 population and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated for each subgroup, and among non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) for reference. The stages of diagnosis (as defined by National Cancer Institute summary stage) were compared between subgroups. Differences between subgroups in all-cause mortality following diagnosis were evaluated utilizing proportional hazards (PH) regression, adjusting for differences in tumor stage, age, and gender. Results: There exist substantial differences in age-adjusted incidences of NCGA between subgroups: Koreans (34.8 per 100K), Japanese (17.0 per 100K), Vietnamese (14.6 per 100K), Chinese (11.2 per 100K), Indian (5.4 per 100K), and Filipino (5.3 per 100K). The incidence among NHWs was 3.8 per 100K. All API subgroups as well as NHWs demonstrated a decrease in age-standardized incidence over the study period. There exist differences in the proportion of cancers diagnosed at local stage: Koreans (37.8%), Japanese (28.1%), Chinese (25.7%), Vietnamese (24.4%), Indian (21.6%), Filipino (18.9%), and NHWs (23.7%). API subgroups had better overall survival from NCGA compared to NHWs (reference) in PH regression: Korean (HR 0.50, CI 0.47-0.54, p<0.001), Japanese (HR 0.79, CI 0.74-0.85, p<0.001), Vietnamese (HR 0.79, CI 0.72-0.87, p<0.001), Chinese (HR 0.70, CI 0.65-0.74, p<0.001), and Indian (HR 0.69, CI 0.58-0.81, p<0.001). These differences remained significant even after adjustment for stage of diagnosis, age, and gender. Discussion: Substantial heterogeneity in risk for NCGA exist between API subgroups. Korean Americans are at highest risk, with incidence nearly seven-fold higher than Filipinos and Indians (whose risk is similar to NHW). This suggests that the higher NCGA-risk in APIs in aggregate are driven by certain subgroups. Interestingly, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Indians all had better survival following NCGA diagnosis than NHWs, even after adjustment for stage of diagnosis. These epidemiologic data may hold important implications for gastric cancer screening or surveillance programs. This abstract is also being presented as Poster B104. Citation Format: Robert J.

4919,Black and Asian Americans say they have faced increased discrimination during pandemic: survey,"Black and Asian American respondents are reporting increased levels of discrimination amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday. The poll found that 58 percent of Asian Americans say that racist comments targeting the group are more prevalent now compared to before the pandemic, while 45 percent of Black respondents said the same. That's more than double the percentages of Hispanic (21 percent) and white (18 percent) respondents who reported people voicing racist views toward them since the coronavirus outbreak, according to the poll. The Pew survey also found that 38 percent of Black Americans and 39 percent of Asian Americans reported someone acting uncomfortable around them due to their race over the past several months. More than a quarter of Asian Americans who responded to the poll, 26 percent, said that they had been in situations where they feared physical harm. About four in 10 Black respondents, 42 percent, also said they were worried they would be viewed with suspicion for wearing a mask in public, while 36 percent of Asian Americans said the same. Just 5 percent of white respondents said they worried about being viewed with suspicion in public for wearing a mask. When it comes to perceptions of racist behavior, nearly four in 10 Americans (39 percent) said those of Asian descent were more likely to face racist attacks or insensitive behavior during the pandemic, and 30 percent said the same of Black people. Concerns about racism and hate crimes targeting Asian Americans have continued throughout the pandemic, with President TrumpDonald TrumpTrump golf club reaches 0K settlement with NJ over drunk driving crash Trump to attend fight of supporter Conor McGregor Giuliani's law license in D.C. suspended MORE himself catching flak for his use of certain phrases to describe the virus that have been condemned by critics.

The White House denied that Trump uses racist phrases and said he didn't believe the term ""kung flu"" was offensive. The Pew poll surveyed 9,654 U.S. adults between June 4-10, and has a margin of error of 1.6 percentage points for the full population, 8.2 percentage points for questions asked of Asian respondents, and 5.3 percentage points for questions directed to Black respondents.

4930,Young Asian American Christians Are Finding Their...,"Late last month, a crowd of mostly young Asian American Christians gathered in the parking lot of the historically black Progressive Baptist Church on the South Side of Chicago. The group of more than 1,000 had marched two miles through the cityтАЩs Chinatown and into a predominantly black neighborhood just south of it, crossing an unspoken border that divides the historic minority communities. тАЬThis was a spiritual act in opposition to the powers and principalities that seek to destroy and divide the church. We broke the stronghold that divided our communities and we said enough is enough,тАЭ said Raymond Chang, president of the recently founded Asian American Christian Collaborative (AACC), which organized the march. Participants came from Chinese Christian Union Church in Chinatown and Progressive Baptist, led by Charlie Dates, along with representatives from over 100 churches to rally together in an act of Christian solidarity. Both congregations have been stalwarts in the city for over a century. Chang and his cohort represent a growing number of millennial and Gen Z Asian American Christians who are striking a new tone when it comes to seeking racial justice and calling out racism in their own communities. Predominantly American-born, these church leaders are paving a path distinct from the historically mono-ethnic enclaves of the immigrant church and choosing instead to build stronger interracial church partnerships. The AACC was founded in March as a response to the worldwide spike in anti-Asian racism following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now the collaborative of East, Southeast, and South Asian church leaders is taking aim at the often-latent anti-black racism within the ethnic churches it represents, holding online panels with black Christian leaders like Esau McCaulley and Ekemini Uwan and pushing members to examine how тАЬAsian Americans have served as a wedge against our Black and Brown peers.тАЭ Tao Thou, one of the police officers charged with the killing of George Floyd for failing to intervene, recently reinvigorated discussion among Asian Americans. ThouтАЩs actions were a тАЬperfect representation of Asian American complicity in racism,тАЭ wrote Larry Lin, a pastor at the Village Church in Baltimore. Others, like Ashley Gaozong Bauer, a biracial white and Hmong American minister, found such arguments reductive. тАЬYou look at one Hmong man, call him Asian, and then project your collective shame unto a people group that has never been fully received by тАШAsian Americans,тАЩтАЭ she wrote. Typically established to minister to the recently immigrated, mono-ethnic congregations have acted as cultural safe havens for newcomers to the United States looking to maintain a cultural connection to their homeland. A 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 42 percent of Asian Americans are Christian. And while many of these immigrant communities initially operate within cultural bubbles adjacent to the majority culture, there can be strong deference toward the тАЬAmerican way of lifeтАЭ by those who have emigrated to the US by choice. тАЬThereтАЩs this overarching desire among Asian Americans to try and be like white people while simultaneously ignoring black people,тАЭ said Lin, who was raised in a Chinese immigrant church in San Jose, California. тАЬThat ignorance itself is complicity.тАЭ While blacks and Asian Americans are both racial minorities in the US, many believe that solidarity among these ethnic groups cannot occur until the тАЬmodel minorityтАЭ ideology is dismantled. Coined in 1966 in the midst of the civil rights movement, the term presupposed that Asian Americans (specifically Chinese and Japanese Americans) were outpacing other non-white groups in their ability to assimilate and achieve economic success. Both statistically inaccurate and culturally reductive, the label has been historically used to distinguish Asian Americans, seen as hard-working and unproblematic, from African Americans. тАЬFor many Asian Americans, the American dream was true,тАЭ said Peter Cha, a professor of church, culture, and society at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. тАЬPartly because of that, when they looked at African Americans in particular, they repeated the narrative that black suffering was their own fault.тАЭ Plus, he said, тАЬtheir churches historically idealized the United States as a morally upright Christian nation, so in that narrative, America could not be an ugly racist country.тАЭ More of todayтАЩs Asian American Christian leaders, like those involved in the AACC, are changing the narrative and turning to Scripture for a more robust understanding of the churchтАЩs role in addressing racial injustice. On the AACC blog, Dallas Theological Seminary student Andrew Wong confronted this ideology and rebuffed his own identity within the model minority myth, saying, тАЬAs followers of Jesus, we must lay aside тАШhollow and deceptive philosophyтАЩ (Col. 2:8) that divides, and instead move forward in full fellowship, of one mind, in Christ Jesus.тАЭ At LinтАЩs multiethnic church in Baltimore, leaders have devoted weekly prayer meetings to lamenting over racial injustice, hosted an online panel with black church leaders, and released a list of anti-racist reading materials for the church to access. тАЬI used to see conversations on race as pandering and distracting from the gospel, but now as I read the Bible I canтАЩt avoid seeing its racial connotations,тАЭ he said. тАЬItтАЩs so relevant to our context. We need to be talking about race in Bible studies and sermons.тАЭ On the West Coast, Roy Chang (no relation to Raymond) opened the pulpit at Seattle Chinese Alliance Church to black church leaders heтАЩs known for over a decade through community partnerships. тАЬThereтАЩs something deeply, deeply wrong when black people have been crying out for centuries and the church has no response,тАЭ said Chang. Another pastor at a multilingual Chinese congregation, Tranwei Yu, recently held a teaching session on Zoom about how the Bible addresses racial tension. тАЬI want to help my people love all of their neighbors, not just their Chinese American ones,тАЭ said Yu, a second-generation Chinese American and the English pastor at Chinese Grace Bible Church in the suburbs of Sacramento. These grassroots efforts to address anti-black racism and other social issues in Asian American churches are not likely to be broadly broadcast. Raymond Chang hopes the collaborative can provide a unified platform to bring similarly convicted believers together. тАЬMany Asian American Christians want to work through these racial divisions, but because of cultural forces [in their churches] like respecting elders or maintain harmony, they havenтАЩt been able to vocalize their concerns,тАЭ said Chang. тАЬNow, theyтАЩre all coming out of the woodwork.тАЭ Saturated in more multicultural perspectives than their parents and equipped with online resources and communities, Christians who previously found their perspectives unaddressed in church have connected online through forums like the AACC and Progressive Asian American Christians, a group established shortly following the election of President Donald Trump. TheyтАЩre also using the internet to spread their message. Jocelyn Shannon Chung, a 24-year-old designer and Taiwanese American in Cerritos, California, posts weighty quotes like the lament from Habakkuk 1 and critiques of white supremacy in trendy hand lettering styles on Instagram. As a fifth-generation Christian whose ancestors were evangelized to by George Leslie Mackay, the first Presbyterian missionary to visit Taiwan in the 19th century, ChungтАЩs faith is deeply intertwined with both Western and Eastern ideals, something she is fighting to untangle. Since hearing Michelle Higgins speak at InterVarsityтАЩs Urbana conference in 2016, Chung has been intentionally listening to more non-white pastors and dialoguing with her older relatives on race. тАЬI donтАЩt want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, rather I want to identify the air that I breathe, to see which parts of [my theology] are still colonized and which parts are authentic.тАЭ Ha-Young Kwon is a pastorтАЩs daughter raised in a Korean American church in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While home from college due to the pandemic, the 21-year-old has begun discussing the Bible and racism with her parents, who are leaders in the Korean community in her area. тАЬDuring a Bible study, I overheard my dad say to someone, тАШI donтАЩt really think about racial issues, but when I listen to my daughter talk about them, I feel I need to participate. This is the America sheтАЩs going to be living in,тАЩтАЭ she said. Last month, Kwon, her parents, sister, and cousin attended The Movement Continues Rally, a local protest demonstration. They brandished a simple sign: тАЬAsians 4 BLM.тАЭ тАЬI was surprised that they responded so well, not because I thought theyтАЩd be racist, but because I didnтАЩt think they considered themselves American,тАЭ said Kwon. тАЬIтАЩm able to serve as the person who connects them to the land that they have lived in for so long.

4953,Videos of racist incidents show bias against Asian Americans,"Professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University Russell Jeung says a pair of videos making the rounds on social media highlight what he says is a form of white nationalism, and an effort to cast Asian and Asian Americans as ""other."" SAN FRANCISCO - A pair of disturbing videos are making the rounds on social media, highlighting incidents of anti-Asian and anti-Asian American bias. Experts in the field of Asian American hate speech tell KTVU the incidents may be shocking, but they're not surprising. One video begins with a man sitting at a restaurant table. ""Trump's going to [expletive] you,"" he says. The evening of fine dining in the Carmel area, disrupted when a patron goes on an anti-asian rant aimed at other diners. The video proceeds: ""You [expletives] need to leave! You need to leave. You do not talk to our guests like that! No, you need to leave! You need to leave. [expletive] Asian piece of [expletive]! Get out of here! Get out!"" A restaurant worker eventually demands the man leave. In another incident, a family walk through Muir Woods by an Asian American Bay Area family disrupted when a woman confronts them, apparently upset they were walking their dog, in the video the woman tells the family: ""You guys, you can't be in this country. Can't be in this country? Excuse me? You can't break the law. Did you say... Yeah! I can't be in this country?"" Professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University Russell Jeung says the videos highlight what he says is a form of white nationalism and an effort to cast Asian and Asian Americans as ""other."" 'The videos that we're seeing now are just examples of the hundreds of incidents we've seen in California that we've received reports on, and we have over 2,000 cases in the United States since mid-March,"" said Professor Jeung. Doctor Joseph Woo from Chinese Community Task Force on COVID-19 says the videos display an ignorance. Woo said if he doesn't belong in America who does? ""It's very frustrating,"" said Dr. Woo. '""We don't belong here?"" I've been here for five generations, my family. If I don't belong here, who belongs here?"" The danger is that what begins with words can escalate to violence. ""It's clear hate speech opens up doors to physical assaults and hate crimes,"" said Professor Jeung. Advertisement Both of experts agree that rhetoric like that spoken by the president, like calling COVID-19 the ""China Virus"" and ""kung flu"", normalizes anti-Asian hate speech. They say the administration needs to change itтАЩs tone to lead on this issue, otherwise there will likely be ongoing incidents of Asian American hate speech and violence.

4959,CEO apologizes after racist rant targeting Asian American family,"A San Francisco tech CEO issued an apology this week after he was seen in a viral video yelling racial slurs and expletives at an Asian American family on the Fourth of July. Raymond Orosa and his family were celebrating his wife's birthday at Bernardus Lodge and Spa's Lucia restaurant when Michael Lofthouse can be seen on camera harassing them, saying, ""FтАФ you Asians,"" ""Go back to whatever fтАФ Asian country you're from"" and ""You don't belong here."" The video begins with the woman who filmed the vulgar encounter asking Lofthouse, sitting one table over, to repeat what he had just said to them. He stares at the camera for a few seconds, then extends his middle finger and said, ""This is what I say."" Lofthouse then said, ""Trump's gonna fтАФ you,"" as he stood up to leave, followed by ""You fтАФ need to leave! You fтАФ Asian piece of s***."" A server then yells at him, ""No, you do not talk to our guests like that. Get out of here."" Orosa told CBS News that he thinks Lofthouse's apology is not sincere. In a statement, the restaurant addressed the incident. ""This is an extremely unfortunate situation, however we are proud of our staff at Lucia in keeping with Bernardus Lodge's core values; this incident was handled swiftly and the diner was escorted off property without further escalation."" A message to the tech company where Lofthouse works asking for a statement has not been returned, according to CBS San Francisco, and a message sent to an Instagram account apparently used by Lofthouse was not returned. In addition, his LinkedIn account appears to have been deleted and his Twitter account has been suspended. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a sharp rise in attacks on Asian Americans across the country. In Midland, Texas, in March, a hate crime attack left a man and his 2-year-old with knife wounds across their faces. In April, a man in New York poured acid on an Asian American woman. There have been more than 2,000 reports in the U.S. of discrimination and harassment aimed at Asian Americans since March. Manju Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said some of the attacks could stem from ""racist rhetoric"" by those in power. ""Some of that is driven by racist rhetoric from our elected officials,"" she said. ""We know that President Trump has called COVID-19 'Kung Flu,' the 'Wuhan Virus,' the 'China Virus.'"" White House officials have repeatedly defended President Trump's statements while harassment cases have spiked. Last month in Queens, New York, a South Korean man said he was shoved by a man yelling racial slurs and blaming Asians for the coronavirus. A bulletin from the FBI earlier this year warned of a rise in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans because of the spread of the coronavirus.

5116,In the Now and Not Yet ├втВмтАЭ Asian American Christian Collaborative (AACC),"An allyтАЩs reflection on what white Christian communities can learn from the #AAC March. By Brian Howell At the risk of falling into virtue signaling, I can say that IтАЩve been to a bunch of demonstrations in the past month. My mostly white, evangelical suburb has held several protests in support of racial justice, police reform, and black lives. Each was a bit different from the othersтАФone being organized by high school students, others by various church groups in town. All were mostly attended by white folks. I was glad to see these moments. Several thousand white Christians stood together to proclaim that all of us who believe in GodтАЩs justiceтАФwho have passively or actively maintained the constructions of whitenessтАФneeded to repent and stand in solidarity with our Black brothers and sisters who have suffered in this system. But on June 28, I left my suburban town to drive into the city to a very different neighborhood. At Ping Tom Park, in ChicagoтАЩs Chinatown neighborhood, I joined the Asian American Christian March for Black Lives and Dignity. It was remarkable in many ways. According to historian Jane Hong, it was one of the largest anti-racism protests organized by an Asian/Asian-American group to stand in solidarity with another minoritized population. From the park, the march moved to the historic Chinese Christian Union Church, then across various neighborhood lines. Passing through deeply segregated parts of the city, we ended at an equally historic, predominantly Black church, Progressive Baptist in the Bronzeville neighborhood. I came partly as a colleague and friend to one of the key organizers. I was further intrigued because of my own personal and professional connections to the Asian American community. But I found myself inspired to reflect more deeply on this struggle God has called us all to engage in these days. Asian American Christians came together to cry out for GodтАЩs justice and voice their own repentance in upholding hierarchies of race. This march became a witness to the intersection of race and culture in the kingdom from which I hope the white church can draw deep lessons. The racialized category of Asian is complicated and, to some extent, relatively new in our lexicon. IтАЩm old enough to remember as our culture shifted from тАЬOrientalтАЭ to тАЬAsianтАЭ in the 1970s and 80s. IтАЩve observed our collective wrestling with the dimensions of the category, which can be expansive, including those with ancestry in Turkey, Iran, and the Indian subcontinent, while sometimes being drawn more narrowly, limited to the Korean-Japanese-Chinese East Asian triumvirate. My Philippines-born wife has joked that she didnтАЩt know she was Asian until she went to high school in Colorado. In her Southern California world, тАЬFilipinoтАЭ always got its own box to check. Like all racialized identities, the category of Asian is dynamic and fluid, adapting to a changing social world. Regardless of its dimensions, in Ping Tom Park, it was clear that the identity of Asian had drawn people together in solidarity. ThereтАЩs no doubt that the trauma of our current moment has underscored the importance of the community coming together with a single purpose. Spurred on by racist references to the тАЬChinese fluтАЭ (and worse), hegemonic whiteness continues to frame Asian-ness as foreign, other, dangerous. Foregrounding any collective racialized and stigmatized identity, whether itтАЩs Asian, Latino/a, Black, or indigenous, serves as a way for those excluded from whiteness to resist a political and social hierarchy, pulling together in common cause. Yet, around the crowd, I saw signsтАФliteral and figurativeтАФ of the diversity within this racialized unity. The literal representation were signs written in Korean Hangul script, Chinese and Japanese characters, Thai script, and more. Flags from the Philippines, Hong Kong, India, and Taiwan waved above the crowd. I have no doubt many other national and cultural identities were part of this racialized Asian collective.There is something beautifully right about the ways an Asian identity, as a racialized community, can hold that together with cultural distinctions. We know the vision of a redeemed world is one of embodied reality and cultural diversity (Rev. 7:9). тАЬRace,тАЭ as the socially-constructed and biologically arbitrary divisions of a global hierarchy, surely will have no power in the realized Kingdom, yet we will have bodies, and, presumably, those bodies will have the same features of skin, hair, eye, and face that characterize human diversity now. тАЬCulture,тАЭ as the beautiful creativity of language, aesthetic, movement, and practice, will continue to be manifest. To see the Asian community come together, then, with a recognition and reflection of cultural distinctions, standing resolutely against the hierarchies constructed in racialization, struck me as deeply reflective of GodтАЩs purposes for the redemption of this world, while pointing to the world to come. In facing the brokenness of this world, the speakers and signs of the march rejected the work of division that has been historically forced on racialized minorities in the United States. There were explicit rejections, in signs and speeches, of the тАЬmodel minority mythтАЭ foisted on Asian immigrants to the US, to offer a thin veneer of security in a trap of racial oppression. Foregrounding this racial identity, Asian/Asian-American Christians stood in solidarity against the violence facing the Black community. My Asian brothers and sisters called us forth, declaring that we would not accept a racial hierarchy into which we had all been forced. They turned that racialized identity against oppression and dehumanization, towards the long moral arc of GodтАЩs justice. Moreover, they would not accept any homogenizing, or leveling of the God-ordained cultural diversity even while subverting the constructions of race. They proclaimed the diversity of GodтАЩs kingdom and the unity of the bodyтАФthe presence of God in the now and the not yet. What might it mean for those of us racialized as white to strive toward this cultural jiu jitsu, turning the power of race on its head by facing it head on, while celebrating cultural distinctions and diversity within a racial category? As a white person, I know we must not deny, as too often happens, the realities of racialization in which identities like mine are normalized, privileged, and invisiblized in the service of an unjust order. At the same time, I do not want to construct or assert something called тАЬwhite cultureтАЭ as an unproblematic identity, a tangled vine of amorphous internet memes without roots in time or place. I do not think that, for many of us, reclaiming connections to a European context is the right option. The forgetting and erasure have been too thorough and effective. We have traded our European cultural birthrights for a pottage of whiteness. At the same time, like my Asian friends who witness to the diversity within their racialized community, we white Christians need to hold together the multiple truths of racialization, cultural heritage, and life in Christ, not as equal in strength or value, but as each reflecting part of what is true in our lives and our world. This demonstration against racial injustice became a demonstration of cultural remembering and Christian unity for the sake of others. In the gospel, we are a holy people of one blood, yet we are still of our families, our languages, our cultures. Our human collectives, those that reflect the purposes of God in human diversity, are not to be dissolved into the identities of race, or even religion. What we are called to do is bring our particularity to the cross for the sake of the whole gospel. I saw, in their desire to stand with Black brothers and sisters, my Asian brethren bring their whole selves, in their particularity, for the love of others. By coming together as those racialized as Asian, the marchers spoke into the social context where minoritized races have been pitted against one another as the hegemony of whiteness seeks to divide and conquer. No more, declared the collective, would we take up some meager privilege at the expense of another. Simultaneously, the cultural diversity and particularity marched with them. Identities of Chinese, Filipino, Indian, and Korean did not compete with the solidarity of the whole but spoke to the common purpose from diverse parts of the body. I cannot yet quite answer the question of what this will look like for us European Americans to divest ourselves of whiteness, rejecting the privilege and dismantling the hierarchy, while embracing cultural distinctiveness. For now, we may need to simply focus on the former. But I find inspiration within the Asian American church. I saw this at Ping Tom Park, on the move to Chinese Union Church, and collected at Progressive Baptist. This is where GodтАЩs people, in the power of his spirit, find ways to recognize the political present and confront it in a prophetic witness, hold to cultural distinctiveness, and, above all, put on love. Because the greatest of these is love. Brian Howell is professor of anthropology at Wheaton College (IL).

5143,Asian American Identity in the Time of COVID-19 | Hogg Foundation,"by Julia Sufrin | Jul 28, 2020 | Blog, COVID-19, Hogg Blog, Podcast┬а Dr. Eric Tang This week we are joined by Dr. Eric Tang, Associate Professor of African and African Diaspora Studies and Director of the Center for Asian American Studies at The University of Texas at Austin. We discuss COVID-19 and Asian Americans, especially now that the pandemic has brought to the forefront many of our nationтАЩs deep xenophobic biases that harm Asian people of color in the United States, including here on the University of Texas at Austin campus. Dr. Tang has had the opportunity to observe the unique mental health challenges that young Asian American students experience on a daily basis. He explains how meeting with and teaching Asian American students in his courses on race and ethnic studies has given him a firmer appreciation of the pressures that these students are under. тАЬI think that [Asian American students] are under more career pressures than I was to go into STEM and satisfy the demands of immigrant parents. As a teacher, I am beginning to really appreciate and learn from my students that that expectation is very real.тАЭ It is because of these kinds of pressures that Dr. Tang believes many Asian American students end up sacrificing their truer interests in order to satisfy family expectations тАУ often at the expense of their own mental health. Where do Asian Americans fit within the complex division racial categories in the U.S.? тАЬI think there is a struggle among Asian Americans to figure out their racial location,тАЭ says Dr. Tang. тАЬAre they people of color in тАШthe same wayтАЩ as African Americans and Latinos, who are dealing with economic inequality compounded by environmental inequality тАУ such as housing segregation and environmental racism тАУ or are they people of color of a different sort, because, according to census data, they tend to do better economically, they tend to have higher educational achievement? Are they closer to white because of that? ThatтАЩs a question that many Asian Americans struggle with.тАЭ Despite the data and the metrics, Dr. Tang explains that culturally, Asian Americans can still never be white, because whiteness is already predicated on тАЬotheringтАЭ Asians. тАЬWe have a history of tethering citizenship to whiteness, and Asians have been excluded from migration and citizenship for the majority of U.S. history.тАЭ This is just one of the reasons why Dr. Tang says Asian Americans today may feel like they are racialized as тАЬperpetual foreigners.тАЭ The pandemic has highlighted historical racisms against Asians and, in some ways, has renewed them. тАЬWe might think of whatтАЩs happening to Asian Americans and the discrimination they face in the wake of тАУ or rather, in the present of тАУ the pandemic as a тАШchange in sameтАЩ,тАЭ says Dr. Tang. He points out the similarities between the xenophobic language of the pandemic, such as the term тАШChinese virus,тАЩ and, for example, the historically racist term тАШYellow Peril,тАЩ which came out in the late 1800s, along with other examples of times when Asians have been framed as a kind of a virulence on American society. But as much as this anti-Asian racism is тАЬthe same,тАЭ circumstances for Asian Americans have also changed. тАЬWe are dealing with a much larger Asian American population today than existed in other periods when Asians experienced discrimination,тАЭ explains Dr. Tang. тАЬAs a result, there could be a more robust response тАУ an anti-racist response тАУ against that kind of racism.тАЭ The mental health of Asian Americans is undoubtably being challenged right now. This, Dr. Tang hopes, could be a point of unity тАУ especially on campuses. тАЬWhen I look at the alarming data about the rates of depression and anxiety among Asian American students and the tragic number of suicides among Asian American students, I say to myself, this could be something that, across class differences, Asian American students and the community in general could rally around,тАЭ says Tang. тАЬCOVID is just one catalytic point that makes it even more important to do this work together, because the pandemic has brought out racism around Asian Americans that we havenтАЩt seen for quite a while.тАЭ ┬а Learn more about our podcast and check out other episodes!

5207,Asian Americans in Hollywood Speak Out Against Racism with #WashTheHate Campaign,"Xenophobic and racist incidents targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities have been on the rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. In response, the #The WashTheHate campaign encourages people to express 20-second messages of solidarity on social media while they wash their hands. Recently, the actors, performers, and broadcasters union SAG-AFTRA teamed up with Asian American celebrities to release a PSA urging people to take a stand against anti-Asian discrimination.┬а As the PSA notes, Asian Americans currently face a surge in racist and xenophobic incidents as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread through the country. Incidents of being spit on, told to тАЬgo back to your own countryтАЭ and more are almost commonplace. Earlier this year, incident reporting center Stop AAPI Hate had received over 1,000 reports of pandemic-related harassment and violence, spanning 45 states, in just two weeks. Celebrities such as Tzi Ma from DisneyтАЩs Mulan and LGBTQ+ activist Alok V Menon have filmed themselves washing their hands for 20 seconds and speaking out against hate towards AAPI communities as part of the campaign. In a video released on July 21, actors including Lucy Liu, Ken Jeong, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Jeannie Mai join them in encouraging watchers to take a stand against anti-Asian discrimination. Related: тАЬTigertailтАЭ Director Alan Yang Produces New Anti-Asian American Bias Ad Campaign┬а The surge in anti-Asian sentiment has also led to a rise in civic engagement in the AAPI community тАФ something that has become apparent in the recent protests over the killing of George Floyd. In fact, a recent Pew Research study found that 75% of Asian Americans support Black Lives Matter. ItтАЩs clear the tensions over the last several months have encouraged more widespread intersectional activism in the US. Whether campaigns like #WashTheHate are effective in spreading awareness about anti-Asian racism, they are already successful in engaging the AAPI community to be even more active against racism, which is a success in itself.

5237,9-year-old Hamilton Fan Inspired by Asian American Representation on Broadway ├втВмтАЬ AsAmNews,"When 9-year-old Leo Lvoff saw Eddy LeeтАЩs name in the Hamilton playbill, he told his mom Mindy Lvoff, тАЬMommy, itтАЩs me! This means I can be in Hamilton.тАЭ According to Inside Edition, Leo is a mega-fan of Lin Manuel MirandaтАЩs hit Broadway musical. He now believes he can have a future on Broadway as an Asian American after seeing Lee, a swing performer for Hamilton, on stage. Lee is the first Asian American male performer to join the Broadway company and is now this New Jersey boyтАЩs newest role model. тАЬI want to be a swing like Eddy,тАЭ Leo said in an interview with Inside Edition, тАЬand then maybe even work my way up to Hamilton.тАЭ Mindy says their family loves the diversity in the show. тАЬHamilton is probably one of the first shows that weтАЩve ever seen that really went out of its way to make sure that everyone had an opportunity to be on that stage, and that meant a lot to us,тАЭ she told Inside Edition. On July 3, Leo threw a watch party for the Hamilton premiere on Disney+. He transformed his home to look like the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City, where Hamilton is performed. He set up a ticket booth, where fellow viewers would present their ticket before entering the watch area in his living room. To the side, Leo set up a gift shop that included Hamilton T-shirts, an Alexander Hamilton book, and a Benjamin Franklin costume. His living room was filled with balloons, decorations, and posters of the different charactersтАЩ silhouettes to replicate the painted doors of the Richard Rodgers Theatre. Keeping the Hamilton theme going, Leo put character and song names into the food dishes that are served which include тАЬPeggyтАЩs in a blanketтАЭ and тАЬYouтАЩll Be Baby Back Ribs.тАЭ This is not the first time Leo has been recognized for his love for Hamilton. In 2018, Inside Edition showed Hamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda a video of Leo rapping along to part of a Hamilton song. In a video with MirandaтАЩs reaction, he said to тАЬkeep wearing that coat. Never stop,тАЭ referring to LeoтАЩs Benjamin Franklin coat. The coat is too small for him now, but Leo still holds it close to his heart. AsAmNews has Asian America in its heart. WeтАЩre an all-volunteer effort of dedicated staff and interns.

5306,Read about how Connie├втВмтДвs experience as a first-generation Asian American influenced her desire to make a change in the world,"The Wonolo Blog July 8, 2020 Wonolo Christine Hanks Hi, My name is Connie. I sit in Dallas, Texas, and I am the market manager for the Northwest region that encompasses North Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Washington state. I work with Requestors on the ground to ensure their success on our platform, which can mean a variety of things. I troubleshoot issues that are happening on site, as well as providing fill rate support. I am an internal advocate for our Wonoloer community within these markets and regions. I also make sure that we are making the right strategic growth decisions to ensure that these markets are growing in a way that is positively impacting both the Wonoloer community as well as our marketplace Requestor community. How I came to be where IтАЩm at today and why WonoloтАЩs mission means so much to me can be traced back to when I was a child. I am a first generation Asian American. IтАЩm the daughter of two immigrant parents that emigrated to America in the 80тАЩs as refugees. When you grow up in that environment, youтАЩre not only a child at that point, but youтАЩre also your parentsтАЩ interpreter, their accountant, their assistant and more. My sister and I were writing checks and applying to jobs for them. We were even writing their resumes, as much as a 10 year old knows how to. We were doing all of that in grade school. One of the memories I can vividly remember is when my dad had been laid off from a company and a few days later he was already working at a different company. I didnтАЩt fill out that application for him, so I thought it was so strange. I asked him, тАЬDad, how did you find this job?тАЭ He said, тАЬWell, actually, thereтАЩs a company out there that you give them your resume, and based on your qualifications, they place you at a company that needs your help, but itтАЩs temporary. ItтАЩs only for two weeks, but at least in those two weeks IтАЩll be able to pay the bills.тАЭ As a first generation child, youтАЩre thinking, this is amazing! I can play outside. I can read books now. I donтАЩt have to worry about doing job applications for my parents. That was my first introduction into staffing. My dadтАЩs two week stint at that company actually turned into two months, and then he was able to find a company that did very similar work. He was hired there and worked at that company for 17 years up until the point that he retired a few years back. Staffing did that for him and it helped so much! When you grow up and you see your parents work minimum wage jobs and earn $7.25 or $8 an hour and barely are able to provide things like safe housing and the necessities, you want to break out of that mold. When I went to college, I thought that I would work in nonprofits. I wanted to impact change, and help families like myself. So when I was in college at San Diego State, I interned at a nonprofit that helped refugee children and families in America. I was there for three years. The change was slow, and I think nonprofits are amazing in their own right. However, the change was slower than I wanted to see. ThatтАЩs when I changed my major to entrepreneurship because I wanted to impact change really fast and in a big way. After I graduated school, I moved to San Francisco, worked in startups, moved back to Texas and continued to work in startups, and then Wonolo found me two years ago. When I interviewed with amazing people at our company, such as our CEO Yong. ThatтАЩs when my dadтАЩs story resurfaced for me. I related so much of WonoloтАЩs mission to my own. I saw that Wonolo was helping folks that looked not so dissimilar to how I grew up. WonoloтАЩs mission was and still is to improve lives every step of the way, so that people can provide for their families. It starts with paying the bills, education, and then moving towards a more sustainable, stable life. This not only helps families, but the actual person who is making incremental changes. ThatтАЩs what my parents were able to do for us, and thatтАЩs what I want to do for others. I see that when I visit client sites and I talk to our Wonoloer community that a lot of their wishes for their own children are exactly the same as my parents. ItтАЩs amazing how it came full circle. ThatтАЩs what led me to Wonolo and why I feel so strongly about not only helping my Requestors, but also the Wonoloer community on our platform. When I have to make a difficult decision, I always go back to the intent behind it and I ask questions, such as: Am I going to make a positive impact? Am I going to improve a process? Is it to streamline something new? What are the negative long term effects? What are the positive effects? Have I thought about what could happen in the short and long term? I think about these questions, my intentions, and the consequences. If the positive effects line up with my intention of what the decision is supposed to solve, then thatтАЩs the right answer for me. If thereтАЩs still a crossroads, I will ask co-workers, friends, and people in my personal life for their feedback. I think itтАЩs important to gather different viewpoints, but not too many or else I just become indecisive. I also make sure that thereтАЩs alignment between intention and impact. The biggest life advice I could give anyone is you never have to worry about being the smartest person, the most analytical, or the loudest speaker. You just have to be the person that cares the most. Think about it in terms of your personal and professional life. Your friends that are closest to you in your personal life are probably folks that care the most. In your professional life, the folks at your company that are doing really well are the people who are putting a lot of intention and care into the work they do. They care about the mission. They care about their teammates, their co-workers, and the projects theyтАЩre working on. Pick something you care about. Invest in it. Cultivate your learning, and improve each day. YouтАЩll be sure to see your life flourish into something beautiful. If you really knew me, you would know that IтАЩm a self proclaimed expert hobbyist. I know a little about a lot of different random hobbies. For instance, cooking, baking, sewing, knitting, painting, furniture making, jewelry making, fashion design, alcohol brewing, painting, gardening are all hobbies I know a little bit about. In all of those different hobbies, I know how to start and complete projects. IтАЩm always within that amateur to intermediate level. I never reach the next echelon of expert level for any of these things. You can call me a Jane of all trades of random crafts. I have all the supplies to do these things. Hopefully, IтАЩll pick one hobby to become an expert in, but so far itтАЩs nice to know a little about a lot in terms of hobbies and fun things to do around the house. ┬й document.write(new Date().getFullYear()); Wonolo Inc.

5437,"More Than 2,100 Hate Incidents Against Asian Americans Reported During Pandemic","More than 2,100 anti-Asian American hate incidents related to COVID-19 were reported across the country over a three-month time span between March and June, according to advocacy groups that compile the data. The incidents include physical attacks, verbal assaults, workplace discrimination and online harassment, CBS News reported. The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action launched a hate incident reporting website on March 19 when the coronavirus was becoming widespread across the U.S. and the media began reporting violent incidents targeting Asian-Americans. The online tool is available in multiple languages and allows users to report the information with the promise that personal information will be kept confidential. On Wednesday, the advocacy groups released an analysis of the incidents reported through June 18 in California, where about 40 percent of the 2,120 hate incidents took place. The groups released the national data to CBS News after an inquiry. Of the 832 incidents reported in California, many included anti-Asian slurs and references to China and the coronavirus. One assailant yelled about тАЬbringing that Chinese virus over hereтАЭ during an attack against an Asian-American man at a San Francisco hardware store on May 6. The assailant reportedly also said тАЬGo back to China,тАЭ тАЬFтАФ- you, ChinamanтАЭ and тАЬFтАФ you, you monkey.тАЭ In another San Francisco incident on June 9, someone threw a glass bottle at a woman putting her child in a car seat and yelled, тАЬGo home ChтАФk.тАЭ And in Santa Clara on June 16, a man kicked a womanтАЩs dog and then spat at her, saying, тАЬTake your disease thatтАЩs ruining our country and go home.тАЭ тАЬThese are real people just living their lives and encountering this kind of hate,тАЭ said Cynthia Choi, the co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, on Wednesday. In California, the website marked 81 incidents of physical assaults and 64 incidents of potential civil rights violations including workplace discrimination, people being barred from establishments or being prevented from using transportation. Of the 583 people who reported their gender, Asian-American women reported almost twice as many incidents of discrimination and harassment as men. About 11% of the people targeted were elderly. The groups last month found that racist rhetoric including from President Donald Trump, who has referred to COVID-19 as the тАЬChinese virusтАЭ and тАЬKung-flu,тАЭ correlates with incidents of racism against Asian-Americans. Some assailants have displayed virulent animosity of China and have parroted TrumpтАЩs тАЬChinese virusтАЭ term, the groups found. While the analysis indicates the incidents are widespread and pervasive in California, they are likely only the тАЬtip of the iceberg,тАЭ with many more going unreported, said Russell Jeung, professor and chair of the Asian American Studies department at San Francisco State University. The advocacy groups have appealed to Governor Gavin Newsom to launch a state racial bias task force to assist state and federal agencies who enforce anti-discrimination and civil rights laws.

5460,Poll Finds Asian American youth overwhelmingly support Joe Biden ├втВмтАЬ AsAmNews,"A poll conducted by Tuft University shows that 78% of Asian American youth are most likely to support Joe Biden, the highest support among any other ethnic group. The CIRCLE poll from TuftтАЩs Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement found that BidenтАЩs support among Asian American youth outpaces that of even Black youth, 73%. 10% of Asian youth prefer Trump, and 12% prefer another candidate. CIRCLE surveyed 2200 youth ages 18-29 from May 20 to June 18. The margin of error in the ethnic breakdown of the poll range from +/-8.1 to 11.0 percentage points. Overall the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1%.┬а CIRCLE also found 58% of youth overall say they support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and 24% supports President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The two issues prioritized by Asian American youth is the environment and racism. Reports of racism toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders sky-rocketed over the past months while Trump gave the coronavirus pandemic nicknames like the тАЬChinese virusтАЭ or тАЬkung flu.тАЭ In the wake of protests, anti-racism movements, and the Black Lives Matter, the poll found youth civic engagement has increased from 2018. According to the survey, in 2018 46% of youth (ages 18-24) said тАЬthey were part of a movement to express its views.тАЭ Today, 62% of young voters say the same. 88% of Asian American youth surveyed said as a group, young people have the power to change things. again, thatтАЩs higher than any other ethnic group. The same percentage of Asian American youth say the outcome of the 2020 election will have a significant impact on their community. Almost half-way into 2020, young people continue to witness racism and discrimination as America stands in a boiling point during a pandemic. The political rally between Americans and constant news exposure through social media may have influenced young people to be more active in civic engagement. CIRCLE found that racism is a prioritized issue among all youth groups of color. тАЬThis 2020 election cycle is particularly interesting because, for the first time in almost over 25 years, weтАЩre moving from a midterm election where young peopleтАЩs participation dramatically increased,тАЭ Abby Kiesa, CIRCLEтАЩs director of impact, said to the Voice of America. тАЬNow there are 47 million 18- to 29-year-olds who are eligible to vote in the 2020 election, and 15 million of them have turned 18 since the last presidential election,тАЭ Kiesa said.

5492,Philanthropy├втВмтДвs New Normal Needs to Include AAPI Communities,"A few isolated thunderstorms developing this afternoon. High 84F. Winds SW at 15 to 25 mph. Chance of rain 30%.. Scattered thunderstorms early, then partly cloudy after midnight. Low 73F. Winds SW at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 40%. Updated: July 8, 2021 @ 11:44 am┬а If the past few months have shown us anything, it is that there is no going back to normal. Beyond the unimaginable thought of full subway trains and crowded restaurants and bars, our тАЬnormalтАЭ was horribly flawed. Our тАЬnormalтАЭ meant accepting the hostility and racism against the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community as COVID-19 spread, a disease that is disproportionately affecting Black communities, who are also the targets of state-sponsored violence. ItтАЩs time for a new normal. A new normal that must address anti-Asian hostility and anti-Black racism head on, especially as organizations seek to diversify and deepen their work around racial equity. To do that, we must acknowledge the historical roots of anti-Asian racism in this country and how it has served the myth of white supremacy. Anti-Asian racism as a tool of white supremacy The demonization of Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic is part of a long history of discrimination and social shaming in the U.S. The Chinese Exclusionary Act of 1882, internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and labeling of Southeast Asians as terrorists post 9/11, are just a few reminders that anti-Asian hostility is long ingrained in AmericaтАЩs history. We see the continuation of that rhetoric not just in the policies of the current presidential administration, but also with the model minority myth. For many years, AAPI people, and East Asians in particular, have benefited from the model minority myth, created to further divide Asian Americans and Black people to benefit white people. Asian Americans were considered hardworking and obedient, a stereotype that embraced anti-Black rhetoric and granted many AAPI people access to something almost like white privilege. This dynamic exists in philanthropy, too. This myth has been harmful for the AAPI community, masking the complexity and unique identities of each community, while further worsening the perceptions towards Black people. But it has also permitted and even encouraged more violence against Black people тАУ by white people and people who arenтАЩt white. A hard reset is needed As conversations about racial equity have gained renewed traction, the reality is that anti-Blackness is still ingrained in the sector. Philanthropic institutions have made bold statements and committed to action to condemn anti-Asian racism and anti-Blackness. But we know from the data available that AAPI communities receive just 0.2% of all U.S. grantmaking, and Black communities received just 1% in 2017. In Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in PhilanthropyтАЩs open letter to philanthropy to cure тАЬviral racism,тАЭ one of the calls to action is to тАЬthink of this moment as a тАШresetтАЩ button to imagine a more holistic approach to philanthropy that gains new traction toward racial and gender equity.тАЭ If we are serious about creating a new normal, we must imagine and create a more holistic philanthropic approach that includes AAPI voices that arenтАЩt at the expense of Black ones. One place to start is by increasing AAPI representation, especially at the leadership level. According to recent data from the Diversity Among Philanthropic Professionals (DAPP) survey, AAPI people make up 9% of the sector, and 14% of the millennials in philanthropy. This statistic bodes well for the future, especially as it relates to the overall size of the applicant pool over the next decade. AAPI are the fastest growing minority population, and are younger than white people, reflecting the trend that young people are more diverse and more progressive. Young, progressive and in primed position for leadership Millennial AAPI representation in philanthropy that reflects more progressive perspectives is critical to responding to and meeting the unique needs of the population, which includes people from over 20 countries and many more cultures, religions and languages. And as millennials become the next philanthropic leaders тАУ and as Gen Zers enter the work force тАУ it is also critical to ensure that there is a leadership development pipeline to positions with decision-making power over foundation strategies. Currently, within the already white-dominated sector, AAPI people are especially underrepresented at the board level, making up only 4% of boards, compared to 60% of white board representation. If this continues, even with increased AAPI representation in other positions, funding inequities will still exist without AAPI voices leading on funding strategies that meet the needs of the community. Diversity at the board level is a key driver to setting strategies and funding priorities that meet the needs of the communities the sector seeks to serve. Representation from the AAPI community is even more important to make sure the complex needs and challenges of the community are not lost or misunderstood as a monolithic community. But increasing AAPI representation must also come with increasing Black representation in the sector. While AAPI people make up 9% of philanthropy, Black people make up only 11% of the sector. DAPP data suggests that even with increased representation of people of color, they are not becoming more Black or even more inclusive of Black voices at decision-making tables. Even though people of color make up 38% of the sector, white people are still the majority in philanthropy, making up 60% of the sector. ThatтАЩs why itтАЩs so important for Asian Americans to play an active role in confronting anti-Blackness in philanthropyтАЩs equity work. Doing so helps our communities break free from the тАЬwedgeтАЭ narrative and helps erode another tool of white supremacy A new world is within our grasp As a sector whose foundations are rooted in the profits born from racial inequality and exploitation, philanthropy has a responsibility to lead as the world looks to create new, more equitable normal. This effort must be co-powered by AAPI voices and experiences without reinforcing harmful narratives that further divide AAPI and Black communities. Additional steps to confront racism and establish a new normal in philanthropy: We must imagine change that does more than just look different. Our communities deserve тАФ and our collective future depends on тАФ an equitable world that is no longer powered by white supremacy but instead on solidarity and justice.

5586,Asian American girls saw pivotal icon in 'Baby-Sitters Club',"FOLLOW ON Advertisement The Associated Press Staff Contact Author Ann M. Martin had no master plan when she decided to make one of the core members of ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" a Japanese American girl named Claudia. Claudia Kishi happened to be everything the ""model minority"" stereotype wasn't. She got bad grades. She thrived in art and fashion. She wasn't struggling to belong. For those reasons and more, Asian American girls in the `80s and '90s idolized Claudia and felt seen in teen fiction. Some of those now grown fans concede the books fall short dealing with race, but a new Netflix adaptation is bringing Claudia (and her pals) into the modern age. In addition to the series that's available now, the streaming service on Friday is releasing ""The Claudia Kishi Club"" documentary. It's filmmaker Sue Ding's love letter to Claudia-philes. ""I want the vibe of the film to be you're at a `Baby-Sitters Club' sleepover with your closest friends and you're reminiscing,"" Ding said. In the short documentary, a handful of Asian American writers and illustrators effuse about how influential the character was for that time. ""For some, their parents were actively not supportive of them pursuing more artistic career choices,"" Ding said. ""Even for those whose families were supportive, they didn't necessarily see people like themselves working in media as directors or painters."" Among those she interviewed was Naia Cucukov, one of ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" series producers. She remembers Claudia's ""aura of cool"" jumping off the page. ""As an Asian American kid growing up having only seen depictions of nerds, geishas, the villain, having that extra layer of someone who could be aspirational was incredible,"" Cucukov said. Another documentary participant, Sarah Kuhn, whose fourth novel in her ""Heroine Complex"" sci-fi series came out Tuesday, called Claudia ""this connective tissue between a lot of Asian girls."" ""Just when you mention her name on Twitter, it summons an entire generation,"" Kuhn said. ""It speaks to her lasting contribution."" With 180 million copies in print worldwide, ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" books were a juggernaut during their 1986-2000 run. They follow Claudia, Kristy, Mary Anne, Stacey and Dawn and their babysitting adventures in the fictional suburb of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. The books are often credited with showcasing teenage girls as entrepreneurs. Martin, who wasn't available for interviews, was not trying to make a statement about Claudia's ethnicity, said David Levithan, an editorial director and publisher at Scholastic who's worked with Martin since 1992. She based the character on a Japanese American friend from elementary school. In present day, Levithan thinks authors writing a protagonist of a different ethnicity would have ""to be doing it for a reason, to have a connection to it and make sure they got it right."" It may seem odd that a white female author created an Asian American icon, but the `80s weren't exactly conducive to Asian American writers. Sarah Park Dahlen, an associate professor of library and information science at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a ""BSC"" fan, said Claudia is only one of two Asian American characters she can cite from her own childhood reading. A combination of little encouragement from Asian American parents and the publishing industry contributed to that, Dahlen believes. After decades of pushing for more diverse voices in children's books, school libraries started receiving federal funding in the `60s and '70s to help expand reading choices. But then came a ""conservative backlash"" against multiculturalism, which led to skittish publishers and dried-up funds, Dahlen said. ""It was a combination of those things that caused this desert of diverse books in the 1980s and a little bit through the 1990s as well,"" she said. Marie Myung-Ok Lee, founder of the Asian American Writers' Workshop, recalls the difficulties of getting her first young adult novel, ""Finding My Voice,"" sold in the early `90s even with the support of popular author Judy Blume. One publisher rejected the book, about a Korean American teen in an all-white town, because ""'We had a book about Cambodia last year,""' Lee said. Today, there are a lot more Asian Americans populating young adult fiction. But Lee, who also teaches at Columbia University, said various studies indicate publishers doing the buying ""don't seem like they're getting much more diverse."" Kuhn, the ""Heroine Complex"" author, is optimistic that female editors of colour rising in the ranks will change that. They are more likely to think broader. ""The story of rejection a lot of marginalized authors get is someone saying `I just couldn't connect to it,""' Kuhn said. ""What always blows my mind about that is all of us have spent our entire lives connecting with characters who do not look like us."" With the increased national dialogue surrounding white privilege, adult Asian American ""BSC"" readers acknowledge the books are lacking in some areas. Claudia talks little about being Asian in an upscale, white community and probably wouldn't know the term ""micro aggression."" The TV version fleshes out some elements like a poignant scene where Claudia, played by Momona Tamada, learns her grandmother was an internment camp survivor. In a nod to the character's newfound cultural awareness, Cucukov had Tamada wear a T-shirt from ""Angry Asian Man"" blogger and activist Phil Yu -- who also appears in the documentary. Designed by artist Irene Koh, it says ""Stay Angry."" ""Claudia is going to go through that journey and is going to learn about activism,"" Cucukov said. ""God willing, if we get a season two, we've got much more growth for Claudia."" ------ Tang reported from Phoenix and is a member of The Associated Press Race and Ethnicity team Momona Tamada portraying Claudia Kishi in a scene from the Netflix series 'The Baby-Sitters Club.'

5675,Committee formed to screen AAPI applicants wanting to work in a Biden administration ├втВмтАЬ AsAmNews,"Views from the Edge Confident that former Vice President Joe Biden will win the November election against Donald Trump, a committee has been created to screen AAPI individuals wishing to work for the incoming Biden administration. AAPI Progressive Action in partnership with AAPI Victory Fund formed тАЬAAPI 46,тАЭ a screening committee to identify, vet and recommend highly qualified Asian American and Pacific Islander candidates for positions in a potential Biden administration. тАЬGovernment functions best when its leadership reflects the diversity of our great nation,тАЭ said Chris Lu, who will act as AAPI Progressive Action Board liaison to AAPI 46. тАЬThe Steering Committee will play an important role in identifying AAPIs who will fight to create a more just and inclusive society.тАЭ Despite being the fastest growing racial group in the U.S. and a population of 23 million strong, AAPIs are underrepresented in political leadership as well as at the federal level. The Screening Committee will conduct a nationwide search for the top 50 candidates whose names will then be submitted to the Biden Transition. Working closely with the Boards of the AAPI Victory Fund and AAPI Progressive Action, the Committee will also make a public endorsement for these senior positions by mid-September 2020. The Screening Committee will be co-chaired by Seema Nanda, former chief executive officer, Democratic National Committee and Mike Honda, former Congressman and founder-chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Committee members include Michelle Bonoan, Managing Director, Koya Leadership Partners; Grace Choi, former White House Liaison staff, U.S. Department of State; Ankur Goel, Partner, McDermott Will & Emery; Julian Ha, Partner, Heidrick & Struggles; and Doua Thor, former Executive Director, White House Initiative on AAPIs. Ginger Lew, former White House executive, will serve as advisor to the Screening Committee. The Board liaisons are Luisa Blue, executive vice president, SEIU; Christopher P. Lu, former Deputy Secretary of Labor; Katie Kalvoda, founder, G3 Ventures; and Dilawar Syed, President and CEO, Lumiata. (Organizational affiliations are listed for information purposes only.) тАЬIn January, AAPI Victory Fund was the first national AAPI organization to endorse Vice President Biden,тАЭ said Katie Kalvoda, who will act as AAPI Victory Fund Board liaison to AAPI 46. тАЬThis November, the AAPI community will carry the Vice President to victory and it is critical that AAPIs are represented at the senior levels of our government once he is elected.

5819,These groups are helping Asian American immigrant voters with mail-in voting,"Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Chuck Park has been busy fielding calls from Korean- and Mandarin-speaking eligible voters at a nonprofit in the New York City borough of Queens. Callers are trying to understand how to register to vote and apply for absentee ballots, typically available in New York to those who are temporarily ill or out of the county on Election Day. MinKwon Center for Community Action, where Park works as a civic participation manager, is trying to help. With the U.S. still in the grips of a deadly pandemic, voting by mail has emerged as a way to ensure that all citizens can participate safely in the 2020 election. While most states allow voters to mail in ballots because of COVID-19, a little more than a handful still do not, according to an NBC News analysis. Scarred by a virus that has claimed more than 170,000 lives nationwide, Asian American voters with underlying medical conditions or in communities hard hit by COVID-19 may think twice about voting in person, voting rights advocates say. And without a mail-in option allowing COVID-19 as a reason, that could affect turnout at polling sites for an electorate that accounts for nearly 5 percent of all eligible voters, among them immigrants whose first language is not English. тАЬIt is a shame that people may be forced to make that choice тАФ do I prioritize my health or do I prioritize exercising my right to vote?тАЭ said Terry Ao Minnis, senior director of census and voting programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a nonprofit. New York, which has the second-largest number of Asian American eligible voters in the country, is reportedly expected to soon permit COVID-19 as a reason to vote by mail. If and when that happens, Park said theyтАЩll contact Korean- and Chinese-language ethnic media and conduct phone banks to explain the news to Asian American voters. Still, the ins-and-outs of mail-in voting can be confusing, Park said. тАЬYou have to fill out the absentee application, then you have to mail it back, then you have to wait for the absentee ballot to arrive, and you have to complete that in a very particular way,тАЭ Park said. тАЬEven for someone whoтАЩs educated and native English speaking, itтАЩs not the easiest process,тАЭ he added. Park said staff members have coached community members with limited English proficiency on how to complete voter paperwork, which can get tricky when doing it over the phone with older callers. Mail-in ballots, however, can be less stressful than showing up to polling stations for voters not fluent in English, Minnis said. тАЬYou have a little bit more time to do it at the pace that you're comfortable with,тАЭ she said. тАЬAdditionally, you can also get assistance with maybe translation or language help from friends and family without having to coordinate schedules.тАЭ Asian Americans Advancing Justice is working on producing materials in languages other than English to allow voters to understand their voting options, their rights and how to exercise them, according to Minnis. Rules vary widely from state to state, with everything from deadlines to register to whether photo ID is required to vote, potentially making the process confusing for limited English proficient voters. The mail-in option, in particular, has become a political hot potato amid concerns that the U.S. Postal Service, facing a grim financial outlook, wonтАЩt be able to deliver ballots on time for them to count. To avoid any impact on the election, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that USPS will suspend any policy or operational changes until after the November presidential election. President Donald Trump has expressed numerous times without evidence that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud. Minnis said that while her organization supports expanding voting by mail, it shouldnтАЩt be the only option. Casting a ballot in person, whether for early voting or on Election Day, could help limited English proficient voters by giving them access to interpreters trained in voting laws and procedures, in locales covered by the section of the Voting Rights Act that mandates it. тАЬIt's really working to try to make sure that in-person options are done in a safe and responsible way,тАЭ Minnis said. тАЬFirst and foremost, that should be what people are concerned about тАФ making sure that people are able to exercise their fundamental right and to do so in a healthy and safe way.тАЭ Chris Fuchs is a freelance journalist based in New York.

5830,"DOJ accuses Yale of discriminating against Asian American, white applicants","Yale called the investigation ""meritless"" and ""hasty."" DOJ accuses Yale of discriminating against Asian American, white applicants The Department of Justice has accused Yale University of illegally discriminating against Asian American and white applicants. A two-year civil rights investigation, in response to a complaint by Asian American groups, found that race was a factor in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, officials said. It also found Asian American and white applicants have one-tenth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with similar credentials. In a letter sent to the university's attorneys, Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, said that the department has ""determined that Yale violated, and is continuing to violate, Title VI."" Title VI of the 1965 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The Supreme Court has ruled that colleges that receive federal funds can consider an applicants' race, along with other factors, but Yale's use of race ""is anything but limited,"" the DOJ said. ""YaleтАЩs use of race at multiple steps of its admissions process results in a multiplied effect of race on an applicantтАЩs likelihood of admission,"" Dreiband said in the letter. In a statement, Yale said it ""categorically denies"" the DOJ's allegation of discrimination, and called the investigation ""meritless"" and ""hasty."" ""At Yale, we look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit among the many thousands of highly qualified applicants,"" the statement said, adding that the Ivy League school takes into account factors such as their ""academic achievement, interests, demonstrated leadership, background, success in taking maximum advantage of their secondary school and community resources, and the likelihood that they will contribute to the Yale community and the world."" Yale said that it has been complying with the DOJ's investigation and had not yet provided all the information the department had requested. ""Had the Department fully received and fairly weighed this information, it would have concluded that YaleтАЩs practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent,"" the statement said. In its letter, the DOJ demanded that Yale stop using race or national origin in its upcoming 2020-2021 admissions cycle. The university could also choose to submit a plan to the DOJ that does consider race or national origin that is ""narrowly tailored as required by law,"" including a date to stop using race in its admissions process. The letter gives Yale until Aug. 27 to comply with the DOJ's demands or risk facing a federal lawsuit. Yale said it does not plan to change its admissions process. ""We are proud of YaleтАЩs admissions practices, and we will not change them on the basis of such a meritless, hasty accusation,"" the university said in its statement. Previously, the DOJ had accused Harvard University of discriminating against Asian American students and ""engaging in outright racial balancing."" A federal judge cleared the school of discrimination in 2019, though a hearing in an appeal of the ruling is scheduled for next month, according to The Associated Press. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",0,0,1,4

5867,Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris: Faculty share insights on selection of first Black and Asian American woman for VP candidate,"Biden campaign website 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, left, gives a high-five to Sen. Kamala Harris, his choice for vice-presidential running mate. ItтАЩs a historic year for women. Aug. 26 marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted American women the right to vote.┬а And for just the fourth time in that history тАФ a span covering 26 presidential races тАФ a woman is on the ticket of a major political party, as Democratic candidate Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris, the U.S. senator from California and the stateтАЩs former attorney general, as his running mate.┬а BidenтАЩs choice comes as the United States faces the twin crises of the coronavirus pandemic and the underlying existing social, racial and economic injustices inherent in our country. Harris is the first woman of color to be chosen as a vice presidential candidate for a major party, and if elected, she would be the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president.┬а We asked some of UCLAтАЩs political and gender studies experts to share their thoughts on the BidenтАУHarris ticket:┬а Natalie Masuoka, associate professor of political science and Asian American studies┬а What we often overlook in presidential elections is that women made up 54% of the overall electorate this past election. So contrary to the typical frames about тАЬsecurity moms,тАЭ etc., itтАЩs not just a specific subgroup of women voters who turns out, but rather a very diverse and large group. Ideally, our representatives can be more mindful of women as the core electorate.┬а Harris as a pick makes sense, given her background and experience with law-and-order issues. This is definitely a core topic this year, and she can speak about it from a real-world experience. Grace Kyungwon Hong, director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Women and professor of Asian American studies ┬а When I think about Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and the first Asian woman to be chosen as the VP candidate of the Democratic Party, I think about her career as first the San Francisco district attorney and then as the attorney general of California. Rather than focusing on her record and whether or not she was a тАЬprogressive prosecutor,тАЭ IтАЩm thinking about the symbolic significance of a Black woman and an Asian woman with such a presence and platform having, in essence, entered public life as a prosecutor тАФ as someone whose job was to put people in prison and to keep them there. A prosecutorтАЩs job is to put people into a brutal and dehumanizing prison system and to keep them there, by whatever means. Right now, for example, in the midst of a pandemic that has ravaged the California state prison system, the California DAтАЩs Association somehow thinks itтАЩs a good use of their time and energy to block expedited release efforts meant to relieve overcrowding and to prevent more COVID-19 deaths. To date, at least 53 people have died of COVID-19 in California state prisons and nearly 9,000 people have been infected. This is from official accounts, which almost certainly undercount the real numbers.┬а This is not to criticize or undermine voting for the BidenтАУHarris ticket come November. Rather, itтАЩs to remind myself and others that electoral politics is, at best, a strategy of harm reduction, and that there are other more visionary and effective avenues toward true freedom.┬а Sonja Diaz, founding executive director of the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs┬а Vice President BidenтАЩs choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate is historic and points to the fact that voters are demanding greater diversity in their elected officials. Senator Harris is someone who will not only appeal to the Democratic partyтАЩs donor base but someone who can energize the partyтАЩs base of Black voters while cross-examining the poor governance from the White House that has marked the last four years.┬а With our country on the precipice of structural change, choosing a woman of color to be vice president points toward a future for our country that is more inclusive and that better reflects the rich diversity and cultural history of our nation.┬а Juliet Williams, professor of gender studies┬а Even after months of speculation that Kamala Harris was at the top of BidenтАЩs shortlist for the VP position, it would be impossible to greet the announcement with anything less than awe. Even given her qualifications for the role as demonstrated by her career as a public servant тАФ rising from San Francisco District Attorney to California Attorney General to U.S. senator тАФ her selection hardly seemed assured, not least because it is so unprecedented.┬а Harris on the Democratic ticket marks a welcome departure from business as usual in U.S. electoral politics, where white men remain vastly overrepresented in a country that prides itself on its deeply rooted commitment to democratic governance.┬а Ellen DuBois, professor emerita of history┬а Kamala Devi Harris тАФ her middle name is important, reminding us that she is not just African American but Indian American as well тАФ is a terribly exciting pick for vice president. I am not the only one who remembers her riveting role in the Kavanaugh hearings тАФ the ultimate prosecutor тАФ and on the presidential debate stage as well. It is a testimony to both Harris and Biden that their conflict on that stage has been set aside in what will prove to be a dynamic partnership going into this race.

This type of language used by the president of the United States and the Chairwoman of the Republican Party of Minnesota is deeply harmful to Asian American communities in Minnesota and furthers divisiveness when we should be working together to end this pandemic. Like all Americans, Asian Americans are experiencing the daily pain that COVID-19 has had on the health and economic well-being of our communities. On top of all this, we have seen a rise in anti-Asian racism against many of our communities across the United States, including Minnesota. In one incident recently, a young Asian couple in Minnesota came home to a note on their door saying, тАЬWeтАЩre watching you. Take the Chinese virus back to China. We donтАЩt want you here infecting us with your diseases! Signed, your friendly neighborhood.тАЭ The labels тАЬChina Virus,тАЭ тАЬWuhan Virus,тАЭ or тАЬKung FluтАЭ exacerbate this racism and invite the general public to blame anyone who is perceived to be Chinese for causing this pandemic. The continued broadcasting of these terms through the megaphone of the president and the MN GOP Chairwoman furthers the harm towards Asian American communities in Minnesota. This must stop immediately. The reality is that there have been failures at all levels of government to address the needs of our communities at this time. Instead of excusing language and shifting blame onto everyday Asian Americans who are trying to survive this deadly pandemic, the Chairwoman should be working within her party to understand the harm that has directly impacted Asian Americans at this time. We urge her to not make excuses for racism and ask that she work with her party and all levels of government to bring our communities together so that support and aid reaches all those in need. Chair Carnahan needs to denounce the presidentтАЩs offensive comments, clearly state that Chinese and Asian communities are not to blame for the pandemic, and get to work to help solve this crisis.

6090,Identity awakening of an Asian American - Cathy Park Hong's Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning - Cold Tea Collective,"Essayist and poet Cathy Park Hong takes a deep dive into examining racial consciousness in her new book Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning. This collection of thought provoking essays explores HongтАЩs personal journey growing up Korean in America, and how her experiences have shaped her identity as an Asian American. In the first essay тАЬUnitedтАЭ, Hong starts by offering a vulnerable account of her experience seeking out a Korean American therapist to treat her depression. She brings up the Korean term, jeong, which is тАЬan instantaneous connectionтАЭ often felt between Koreans. ItтАЩs the idea that Koreans think other Koreans will understand them better because of their shared heritage. ItтАЩs seen as a тАЬshortcut to intimacy.тАЭ тАЬAsian Americans inhabit a vague purgatorial status,тАЭ she wrote. Asian Americans always seem to be caught somewhere in between the black and white binary because they are тАЬnot white enough nor black enough; distrusted by African Americans, ignored by whites.тАЭ Who let in all the Asians? Hong emphasizes that there is a lack of literature around the self-hating Asian American тАУ not enough has been said or written about it. She touches on her fatherтАЩs story as an Asian immigrant and how he was a prime example of the тАЬmodel immigrant,тАЭ highlighting his charisma and kindness. Asians are perceived as the middle men, or тАЬmiddle managers,тАЭ as Hong calls it. тАЬI am frantically paddling my feet underwater, always overcompensating to hide my devouring feelings of inadequacy,тАЭ she wrote. In the essay тАЬStand UpтАЭ, Hong introduces the meaning of the bookтАЩs title. Minor feelings are тАЬthe racialized range of emotions that are negative, dysphoric, and therefore untelegenic,тАЭ she wrote. They are built from bits and pieces of everyday racial experiences. ItтАЩs being told тАЬOh, itтАЩs all in your head,тАЭ and having your reality constantly be questioned or dismissed. Minor feelings create cognitive dissonance. Hong explains how these feelings occur тАЬwhen American optimism is enforced upon you,тАЭ contradicting your own racialized reality. тАЬMinor feelings are also the emotions we are accused of having when we decide to be difficult,тАЭ she wrote. Once externalized, minor feelings are interpreted as тАЬhostile, ungrateful, jealous, depressing,тАЭ and out of line. She also touches on respectability politics as a writer. тАЬWriters of colour had to behave better in their poetry and in person; they had to always act gracious and grateful so that white people would be comfortable enough to sympathize with their racialized experiences,тАЭ she wrote. She was always reminded of the whiteness in the room during her experiences doing poetry readings and stand-up. In the essay тАЬThe End of White InnocenceтАЭ, Hong talks about the minor feelings of shame and narrates some of her childhood memories of racial trauma. She recalls a time her mother dressed her in a Playboy shirt and sent her off to school. She also recounts the times she witnessed her immigrant parents be mocked by white adults. тАЬI am a dog cone of shame,тАЭ she wrote. The flip side of shame is innocence тАУ a sheltered unknowingness that often hardens into entitlement. Hong describes тАЬwhite innocenceтАЭ as the refusal to engage with shame surrounding their white identities. The ironic result of innocence is that white Americans are тАЬunable to understand the world that they themselves have made.тАЭ Oftentimes, they тАЬlive in segregated environments that protect and insulate them from race-based stress.тАЭ As a writer, Hong is determined to help overturn the тАЬsolipsism of white innocence.тАЭ This book offers an honest and refreshing perspective examining Asian American history, psychology, and identity. Hong has provided a unique lens that uncovers the complexities of racial consciousness, and here are four insights/lessons learned from Minor Feelings: 1. We must seize this opportunity and change American literature For too long, Asian AmericansтАЩ stories have been shaped and framed by white imagination. This is why writers of colour must tell their stories of racial trauma. Hong writes about the need to тАЬoverhaul the tired narrativesтАЭ that have automated the identities of Asian Americans. 2. Writing about race is polemic As Asian Americans, we must confront the white capitalist infrastructure that has erased us. тАЬTo truly write about race, you have to write against the narrative because the racialized mind is an infernal circle,тАЭ Hong wrote. 3. Understand the differences between innocence and shame Innocence is both a privilege and a cognitive handicap, while shame is sharp and prickling awareness. тАЬOur shame is caused by our repressive culture,тАЭ she wrote. Bad English was once a source of shame for Hong, but now itтАЩs part of her heritage. Her shame is not cultural but political. 4. Indebtedness is not the same as gratitude тАЬThroughout my life, I had felt the weight of indebtedness,тАЭ she wrote. To be indebted is to be тАЬcautious, inhibited, and to never speak out of turn.тАЭ Hong emphasizes that indebtedness is not the same as gratitude. To be indebted is to fixate on the future.

6181,How Kamala Harris or Tammy Duckworth as VP could impact the Asian American vote,"WASHINGTON тАФ As Joe Biden gets closer to announcing his vice presidential pick, pressure has intensified to pick a woman of color. In the aftermath of the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, most of the attention has been focused on a handful of Black women. Two of those on his short list stand out for a different reason: Both are part of the Asian American community. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is Thai American, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who is Black, is also Indian American. Both parties have largely overlooked the impact of the Asian American vote, but it could be significant in 2020. Battlegrounds states like Michigan, Texas and even Arizona тАФ all states where Biden and President Donald Trump are within single digits in recent polling тАФ have booming Asian American populations. From 2012 to 2018, for example, the population of eligible voters in Arizona grew by 13 percent тАФ but when you look at Asian American voters, the growth was 47 percent. Christine Chen, the executive director of APIAVote, said that Asian American voter turnout will ""definitely"" affect both Senate races and the presidential race in November тАФ and that the involvement and engagement of Asian American voters in certain swing House races is already making a difference. One of the swing House races in which Asian American turnout could spike is in Texas' 22nd District, which includes the suburbs of Houston. It's reliably red, but with an Asian American population of 19 percent, Democratic candidate Sri Preston Kulkarni, who is South Asian American, is hoping to flip it blue in November. But when it comes to the presidential race, the relative silence in public discussions about the significance of having two Asian American women under consideration for vice president contributes to an overall sense of ""invisibility"" among Asian Americans, especially when it comes to politics, advocates say. ""Their Asian heritage is invisible in most conversations"" happening around Biden's pick, said Sayu Bhojwani, president of New American Leaders, an organization that works to get immigrants running for office. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Asian American voters have historically turned out to vote at lower rates than other racial groups. But both Democrats and Republicans have histories of failing to engage with Asian American voters, even though they are the fastest-growing minority group in the country. In a poll from AAPI Data in 2018, roughly 50 percent of Asian Americans said they had not been contacted by the Democratic Party; the number rises closer to 60 percent for being contacted by Republicans. It's a community under a wide umbrella of cultures, languages and political beliefs, so voter turnout would benefit both parties. The Vietnamese American community has a longer history of voting Republican and leans more red compared to Indian, Chinese and Japanese Americans, for instance. ""Parties and candidates need to not take our communities for granted and invest in learning about our political histories, about our specific cultural patterns,"" Bhojwani said. ""Asian Americans care about bread-and-butter issues just like most other voters. It's really about how much are we going to invest in the specific outreach and connection that's required."" That outreach is deeply important, given that two-thirds of Asian Americans are immigrants тАФ there's no established history of voting in U.S. elections in their families. ""If your parents vote, the chances of you becoming a voter is significantly higher. So imagine if your parents are immigrants and they can't pass that down to you. There's a language barrier. There's unfamiliarity with being engaged and getting involved in the democratic process. ... I think that plays a part in the invisibility role,"" said Jennifer Baik, a communications and policy associate at APIAVote. Breaking the cycle of political invisibility also comes down to the power of Asian Americans running for office themselves and how their presence on the political stage turns out more people in their community in terms of votes and fundraising. Some of those candidates are getting financial support from the party, as well. In the Texas 22nd District race, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently invested in digital ads for Kulkarni тАФ running them in Chinese and Hindi to break down the language barrier for many Asian American voters. ""When Asian Americans run for office, they actually do increase the AAPI participation,"" Chen said, using the common initialism for Asian American and Pacific Islanders. ""What we have seen is that, as there's been a growth of AAPIs running for office across the country, we've also seen a growth of AAPI participation."" That's exactly why some Asian American voters say having an AAPI woman on the Democratic presidential ticket able to relate to their experiences and identities would be so significant тАФ and have the potential to impact key states up for grabs in 2020. Neil Makhija, the director of Impact, an organization to get Indian Americans to run for office, recently wrote an op-ed about why he supports Harris for Biden's vice presidential pick. ""Even knowing her story will inspire people"" to vote, Makhija said. ""Many of our parents are immigrants. We share that experience.""

For example, if you were to use the 4% rule, which is a traditional rule of thumb that suggests you take out 4% of your retirement savings every year to live on, youтАЩd generate about $30,000 to $35,000 a year, said Morgan Hill, chief executive officer of Hill and Hill Financial.

6252,Feds: Yale Discriminates Against Asian American and White Applicants - Ordinary Times,"by Andrew Donaldson ┬╖ August 13, 2020 After a judge cleared Harvard in 2019 of similar charges, now the DOJ has concluded a two-year investigation into Yale, alleging discrimination against certain applicant demographics. A Justice Department investigation has found Yale University is illegally discriminating against Asian American and white applicants, in violation of federal civil rights law, officials said Thursday. Yale denied the allegation, calling it тАЬmeritlessтАЭ and тАЬhasty.тАЭ The findings detailed in a letter to the collegeтАЩs attorneys Thursday mark the latest action by the Trump administration aimed at rooting out discrimination in the college application process, following complaints from students about the application process at some Ivy League colleges. The Justice Department had previously filed court papers siding with Asian American groups who had levied similar allegations against Harvard University. The two-year investigation concluded that Yale тАЬrejects scores of Asian American and white applicants each year based on their race, whom it otherwise would admit,тАЭ the Justice Department said. The investigation stemmed from a 2016 complaint against Yale, Brown and Dartmouth. тАЬYaleтАЩs race discrimination imposes undue and unlawful penalties on racially-disfavored applicants, including in particular Asian American and White applicants,тАЭ Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, who heads the departmentтАЩs civil rights division, wrote in a letter to the collegeтАЩs attorneys. Prosecutors found that Yale has been discriminating against applicants to its undergraduate program based on their race and national origin and тАЬthat race is the determinative factor in hundreds of admissions decisions each year.тАЭ The investigation concluded that Asian American and white students have тАЬonly one-tenth to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials,тАЭ the Justice Department said. тАЬUnlawfully dividing Americans into racial and ethnic blocs fosters stereotypes, bitterness, and division,тАЭ Dreiband said in a statement. тАЬIt is past time for American institutions to recognize that all people should be treated with decency and respect and without unlawful regard to the color of their skin.тАЭ The investigation also found that Yale uses race as a factor in multiple steps of the admissions process and that Yale тАЬracially balances its classes.тАЭ The Supreme Court has ruled colleges and universities may consider race in admissions decisions but has said that must be done in a narrowly tailored way to promote diversity and should be limited in time. Schools also bear the burden of showing why their consideration of race is appropriate. In a statement, Yale said it тАЬcategorically denies this allegation,тАЭ has cooperated fully with the investigation and has been continually turning over тАЬa substantial amount of information and data.тАЭ Tags: admissions scandalAsian-Americansdiscriminationhigher edYale Andrew Donaldson Born and raised in West Virginia, Andrew has since lived and traveled around the world several times over.

He can usually be found misspelling/misusing words on Twitter @four4thefire and his writing website Yonder and Home. October 12, 2011 November 10, 2013 July 14, 2018 A reminder: 12% of Yale students are legacy. Aka, about 700 of them. Sorta puts that тАШrejects scores of Asian American and white applicants each year based on their race, whom it otherwise would admitтАЩ in perspective, doesnтАЩt it? Yeah, it might reject тАШscoresтАЩ of qualified white applications. It also might pick _hundreds_ of unqualified white applications because their parents and grandparents attended Yale. Some of who literally were attending while the school was segregated.Report Oh, and another reminder: Legacy admissions basically exist to keep to Jews out of elite schools. That was their origin, literally to keep minorities out of the schools. Schools found the тАШJewish quotaтАЩ, the amount of Jews they were willing to admit, less and less defensible, so invented legacy admissions. The minorities being kept out has changed a bit, but itтАЩs the same principle. Affirmative action tries to undo the mistakes of the past by giving traditionally discriminated again groups a slight advantage. Whether or not people think this is justifiable is debatable. ItтАЩs possible itтАЩs not a good idea. IтАЩve never liked it, mostly because college is actually way too late in the process to fix educational issues. But having people complaining about _that_ while just blithely accepting the much larger system of legacy admissions that was literally built to give advantage to traditionally _privileged_ groups and lock out minorities, and still mostly manages that, is absurd.Report Yale can accept whomever it wants as students. But it canтАЩt want whomever it wants.Report Although the legacy admits may not be the best as these things are generally measured, Yale, like all other top-tier colleges, has so many more highly-qualified applicants than it can take that it could dispense with the admissions bureaucracy, draw the names out of a hat (maybe after culling the least promising 10% or so), and almost nobody would notice in practice any difference in the quality of the entering class. The ethnic and class composition of the entering class would be whatever it was, nobody could yell about discrimination, educational standards would be maintained, and the disappointed aspiring Eli might end up at Old Nassau or NYU, with little genuine reason to complain.Report YaleтАЩs admission standards just got cancelled. HereтАЩs the breakdown: The enrolled student population at Yale University is 44.3% White, 13.9% Asian, 9.4% Hispanic or Latino, 5.67% Black or African American, 4.76% Two or More Races, 0.324% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.108% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders. why doesnтАЩt that add uo to 100%тАжReport Ahh. тАЬNon-resident aliens.тАЭ They come in at 21%.Report It would be interesting to see an admissions equivalency chart. Like, take the academic record of the median black HYPS admit. At what schools do the median Asians have similar records?Report How does HYPS compare to HBCU?Report TrumpтАЩs 2020 America тАУ Where making Yale white again is a way better use of DoJ time then actually keeping polling places open in minority communities or keeping police from killing a man over a fake $20.Report Personally, I think that legalizing marijuana would fix *SO* many problems across the board. Policing, job discrimination, and stuff down the road too. I canтАЩt believe that the House hasnтАЩt put forward a bill yet.Report the War on Drugs has been a dismal success in as much as it has destroyed inner cities in exactly the way it was hoped. Legalizing marijuana would indeed solve a great many problems тАУ including tax revenue sources (See Colorado); so would retooling cocaine sentences so that they are proportional to the crime, not more lenient by form of cocaine consumed.Report Yes. We know this is your pet issue. So much so that you canтАЩt comprehend people with other priorities, ranked priorities, different priorities, etc. It is a monomania for you.Report I thought we were taking turns talking about what weтАЩd rather talk about.Report Do you understand why the Drug War matters in this?Report In this case, no. This is a thread about the DOJ stating that Yale discriminates against Whites and Asians. This is a claim that has been tried and failed against Harvard. It is also patently false based on the demographics. So it is about the ongoing white supremacy and racial resentment of the Trump admin. Jaybird launches into his monomania.Report So it is about the ongoing white supremacy and racial resentment of the Trump admin. The argument that race quotas and other admissions criteria at elite schools discriminate against whites, and especially asians, has been circulating for at least decade. So linking this ruling back to Trump and white supremacy requires argument. I ask this seriously: do you want to make that argument?Report I donтАЩt have a strong opinion about this Yale case or not, but note how fluid racial categories are where Asians are variously white or nonwhite depending on the circumstances, similar to Saul and LeeтАЩs observations that Jews occupy some gray zone in between white and off-white. My parochial and anecdotal sense is that in a highly European group, Asians are off-white, then in an integrated group with Africans and dark skinned people Asians become white. Sort of like how cream becomes either a neutral background or accent color depending on the carpet.Report A couple of years ago there was a very big debate on diverse the tech industry. There might not be that many African-Americans or Hispanic-Americans but you have lots of Asian-Americans and Asian immigrants. The issue seemed to be whether a high percentage of Asians was enough to make Silicon Valley diverse or do you need more Black people and Hispanics. I think that in certain Intersectionality corners, people of color really means of African, Indigenous American or Australian, or Hispanic descent. Asians are kind of color, especially if they are Muslims from the Indian subcontinent, but not really of color the way the above groups would be.Report I think that in certain Intersectionality corners, people of color really meansтАж Intersectionality is limited to the intersecting properties of *oppressed* people(s) in specific contexts.. So skin color alone isnтАЩt determinative.Report All I can say is this racial taxonomy stuff is messed up. Reminds me of this Report ThatтАЩs a pretty funny video. (and should be required viewing)Report The most ridiculous thing is it doesnтАЩt even need to exaggerate or follow anything to Its logical conclusion to get the result.Report How is the helpful in answering the question I asked Saul?Report Did you mean to say тАУ тАЬYale is discriminating against whites, especially AsiansтАЭ or тАЬYale is discriminating against Asians, not whites.тАЭ? Honestly I donтАЩt care one way or the other. Just noting how the category becomes fluid and contextual, at the convenience of whatever point is desired. Maybe the larger point is that the boundary of тАЬWhite EnoughтАЭ are weaponized in service to whatever group wants to gain advantage sort of like an awful version of Dave ChappelleтАЩs ethnic draft where an Asian is drafted into the White Army to drive out the Blacks, but then the moment the threat is past, is pushed out of the gates as well, and everyone starts giving side eye to the Jew.Report Not that you should necessarily care, but this doesnтАЩt clear anything up for me to understand what you mean. I can read the words, so I know what you have said, but I assume this has some more to it than the words here in your mind?Report IтАЩm lost with this comment тАУ I really have no idea what any of this means, or even what I think it maybe, sort of could mean, for you. Are we talking parisian or hamburgian euro group?Report IтАЩd just like to point out that my marijuana policy comment was responding to a comment that was discussing TrumpтАЩs inability to keep the cops that killed George Floyd under control.Report One of the reasons certain minorities have a problem accessing the Ivies (or Higher Ed in general) is because drug convictions impact student aid eligibility. Factor this against how often minorities are convicted for minor drug offense via a plea deal, and you have large demographics getting cut out of the aid pipeline.Report You realize that there are international treaties that the control a lot of these things, so the House just canтАЩt pass a bill without renegotiating treaties. You also realize that said bill would not even make it on the Senate floor. IтАЩm not even seeing how legalizing marijuana is going to be the magical bullet solution. It certainly wasnтАЩt in the states that past it.Report While I am more than happy to acknowledge that we have to keep arresting BIPOC and LGBTQQIIAAPDM+ people for smoking marijuana because we have international treaties, IтАЩm still kind of shocked that people are willing to defend the status quo because changing it would be difficult. Or, hell, make grand sweeping gestures that could then be proven hollow by Cocaine Mitch killing it in the Senate. Or, hell, make the DOJ come out and say something official! Like they did about Yale.Report It seems like there are solutions that are rejected not on the merits but rather because if they worked they would tend to undermine a larger world view.Report IтАЩm not even seeing how legalizing marijuana is going to be the magical bullet solution. Who said ending the Drug War was a magic bullet solution to social problems? Has anyone *ever* said this? You realize that there are international treaties that the control a lot of these things Everyone whoтАЩs thought about the issue for more than a few minutes knows that international treaties come into play, but you reverse the causality here. The Treaties donтАЩt тАЬcontrolтАЭ what happens domestically, and insofar as they create an obstacle to better domestic policy they should be scrapped and re-written.Report Jaybird above practically said it is a magic bullet even if he didnтАЩt use that word. тАЬPersonally, I think that legalizing marijuana would fix *SO* many problems across the board. Policing, job discrimination, and stuff down the road too. I canтАЩt believe that the House hasnтАЩt put forward a bill yet.тАЭ Legalize marijuana and everything like police brutality, job discrimination, and more will magically mystically solve themselves.Report Lee, youтАЩre acting like youтАЩve never heard Jaybird talk about criminal justice issues before тАУ like about the role cop unions play, frinstance тАУ which strikes me as disingenuous.Report The referent of тАЬdisingenuousтАЭ is unclear.Report You have it backwards. The DOJ is filing these lawsuits because it is Yale that is determined to keep Yale white. Liberal elites are very protective of their elite and privileged positions.Report Well the the DoJ got it really wrong since their action claims that whites have been discriminated against in admissions.Report The DOJ is claiming that the discrimination was against Asians, in an action filed by Asians. Whites are only affected insofar as theyтАЩd never get into Yale with comparable test scores as some other groups that Yale racially favors. But of course Democrats will bend over backwards to argue in support of racial discrimination. Heck, some progressive universities are even mandating racially segregated orientation classes now. Kamala HarrisтАЩs kids probably find that confusing because theyтАЩre Swedish Americans.Report Making Yale stop discriminating by race will probably not increase the percentage of white students very much, but it will increase the number of Asian-American students substantially. That was the result in California when Prop 209 went into effect and the UC admissions departments hadnтАЩt figured out more subtle ways of discriminating on the basis of race.Report The GOP march into racial resentment and white grievance continues apace.Report These guys donтАЩt seem to be GOP members. https://summit.news/2020/08/14/black-lives-matter-mob-demands-white-people-give-up-their-homes/Report I looked at that piece. тАЬSummit NewsтАЭ. Why would the local paper of Summit County in CO being talking about this??? Oh i see this Summit News is something else. There is no information about who they are or who owns them. No background on this pub at all. Interesting. Every story is red for conservatives: тАЬvirtue signalingтАЭ, pro-trump stories and anti Dem stuff. Fine if that is what you are into. But not exactly something that anyone should trust w/o knowing anything about them and it clearly set up to get conservatives riled and give ammo for throwing out links on threads.Report Eh, conservatives have a pretty strong case when weтАЩre talking about race based affirmative action. And since when did Asian count as white?Report Most of the evidence for white privilege is outcome-based. White people earn more money than black people. We do better on standardized tests. WeтАЩre admitted to elite universities at higher rates (though some AA hard enough to prevent this). We live longer. WeтАЩre arrested, incarcerated, and killed by police at lower rates. And so forth. By all of these standards, Asians are doing even better than non-Hispanic whites. In fact, on some of these metrics the Asian-white gap is as large as the white-black gap. If Asians werenтАЩt white, it would seriously fish up the Narrative. So theyтАЩre white.Report No, they donтАЩt. This is another variant of bad faith trolling from conservatives and generally most of them probably think fewer black and brown people should go to college. The new attack against AOC is also that her GPA is not good. This is rich considering that Trump is probably a functional illiterate with zero intellectual curiosity. They are bad faith trolls and nothing more. They provide no evidence of correctness or sincerity. Any thing that says whites are discriminated against in college admissions is a dictionary definition of trolling. This is the crowd that spent years attacking Barack Obama with claims that he was only admitted to Harvard Law and got to the Law Review because of diversity. Now the attack is on AOC. Meanwhile, they seem fine with the fact that Biden went to Syracuse for Law School which is a much less prestigious school than Harvard Law.Report None of that is germane to race based affirmative action. I, personally, am not convinced that race based affirmative action is bad policy but the left should view it as the danger it is. It is treating people differently because of race no matter how one slices it. In my opinion race based AA should be treated like radioactive chemotherapy. It IS a poison. Maybe we can use it to cure a bigger ill but it should be used gingerly, cautiously and with a solid plan to not use it indefinitely.Report UC has settled numerous cases with Asian applicants for discriminating against them. They have the legal and political firepower to defeat anyone in court if the facts are on their side; settling out of court is pretty much proof that theyтАЩre guilty. Given the absolute lack of intellectual diversity among university presidents and admissions officers, itтАЩs pretty clear that the only way elite colleges keep Asian percentages as low as they are is by actively discriminating against Asians. Your ad-hominem attacks on TrumpтАЩs intelligence and education clearly show that you donтАЩt have an actual case to make.Report Your email address will not be published.

6262,First-Year Seminar: Asian American Literature,"Harvard History & Literature News, stories, and updates from H&L Hist & Lit tutors are offering first-year seminars this fall! Catherine Nguyen is teaching one on тАЬAsian American Literature,тАЭ and talked with us about the class, her advice for first-year students, and some of her other favorite books! To apply for a seminar, visit here! What made you want to teach this seminar?IтАЩm so excited to teach this first-year seminar on Asian American literature! During my dissertation writing years, I was so focused on Vietnamese American and diasporic literature that I didnтАЩt have time to read all the other Asian American literature coming out then. When I finally finished the PhD and got to Harvard, the first Asian American works I picked up to read were Min Jin LeeтАЩs novels Free Food for Millionaires and Pachinko. It was thrilling and refreshing to read about LeeтАЩs beautiful prose so much so it got me really excited to teach a Asian American literature class where we can linger on the beautiful storytelling of different Asian American experiences. Unfortunately, Pachinko is way too long for a first-year seminar, but I hope that the readings I chose will speak to students in the way LeeтАЩs writings and other Asian American writing has spoken to me. WhatтАЩs something youтАЩre looking forward to sharing with students in class?I am so excited to provide students with the opportunity to engage with Asian American artists and activists Rachel Kuo, PhD, Trinh Mai, and Shing Yin Khor. I got the Elson Family Arts Initiative Fund to Support Integration of the Arts into the Curriculum to fund the workshops as well as provide students with a plethora of art supplies. Even though the art workshops will be virtual, I hope that having supplies on hand and being able to interact with the artists and activists that students will have a fun, creative time. I also hope that students will be inspired to take up the opportunity and choose to complete a creative final project.What advice do you have for a first year student? Have fun and challenge yourself! The first-year seminars are graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory, and I would encourage first years to take a class they might not have taken otherwise or have no idea about the seminar topic. ItтАЩs a great opportunity to really engage with the instructors and other fellow first years to create a really memorable first-year experience. Besides Asian American literature, what else do you like to read?For bedtime/turn-off-the-brain reading, I often turn to Nordic mysteries because theyтАЩre thrilling and reliable (sometimes too much!). I am a big fan of the Bront├л sisters, Thomas Hardy, and I also read a lot of graphic novels and was fortunate to offer an HL90 on Asian American comics and graphic novels last year.

6398,Joe Biden Names Senator Kamala Harris as his Running Mate ├втВмтАЬ First Black Woman and Asian American in the Role.,"The California senator of Indian-Jamaican heritage had long been considered the front-runner for the number two slot. The former California attorney general has been urging police reform amid nationwide anti-racism protests. Mr Biden will face President Donald Trump in the election on 3 November. Ms Harris will debate Mr TrumpтАЩs running mate, Vice-President Mike Pence, on 7 October in Salt Lake City, Utah. Only two other women have been nominated as vice-presidential candidates тАУ Sarah Palin by the Republican party in 2008 and Geraldine Ferraro by the Democrats in 1984. Neither made it to the White House. A woman of colour has never been appointed to a presidential ticket by either of the two main American political parties. No woman has won the US presidency either. Mr Biden tweeted that he had тАЬthe great honourтАЭ to name Ms Harris as his number two. He described her as тАЬa fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the countryтАЩs finest public servantsтАЭ. He noted how she had worked closely with his late son, Beau, when she was CaliforniaтАЩs attorney general. тАЬI watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse,тАЭ he tweeted. тАЬI was proud then, and IтАЩm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.тАЭ Ms Harris later tweeted that Mr Biden тАЬcan unify the American people because heтАЩs spent his life fighting for us. And as president, heтАЩll build an America that lives up to our ideals. тАЬIтАЩm honored to join him as our partyтАЩs nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.тАЭ The campaign announced that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will deliver remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday afternoon on тАЬworking together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forwardтАЭ. Mr Biden pledged in March to name a woman on the ticket. He had faced mounting calls to pick a black woman in recent months as the nation was convulsed by social unrest over police brutality against African Americans, a key voting bloc to the Democratic Party. Ms Harris, 55, dropped out of the presidential race in December after failing in her bid to win the Democratic nomination. She repeatedly clashed with Mr Biden during the primary election debates, most notably criticising his praise for the тАЬcivilтАЭ working relationship he had with former senators who favoured racial segregation. The Democrat was born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father. She went on to attend Howard University, one of the nationтАЩs preeminent historically black colleges and universities. She has described her time there as among the most formative experiences of her life. Ms Harris says sheтАЩs always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as тАЬan AmericanтАЭ. In 2019, she told Washington Post that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. тАЬMy point was: I am who I am. IтАЩm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but IтАЩm fine with it,тАЭ she said. Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe BidenтАЩs running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be his ticket. SheтАЩs relatively young and telegenic, and as the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants reflects the growing diversity of the Democratic Party. WhatтАЩs more, sheтАЩs been in the spotlight of the national media, having campaigned for president in 2019 and, for a while last summer, risen to near the top of some polls. Many of her rivals for the number-two spot had never faced such scrutiny, so there was no proof that they could hold up under fire. Another underrated advantage for Ms Harris was her friendship with Mr BidenтАЩs late son, Beau, formed when they were both attorneys general. Mr Biden places a high value on family тАУ and that connection may have made choosing her easier. Now Ms Harris will have a chance to hit the campaign trail again and prove that she deserves this historic pick. If she succeeds, sheтАЩll be in prime position to seek the presidency again, perhaps as early as 2024. Today has made her a force in the Democratic Party for years to come. After four years at Howard, Ms Harris went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings, and began her career in the Alameda County District AttorneyтАЩs Office. She became the district attorney тАУ the top prosecutor тАУ for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first African American to serve as CaliforniaтАЩs attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in AmericaтАЩs most populous state. In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Ms Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic partyтАЩs rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as CaliforniaтАЩs junior US senator in 2017. She was only the second black woman ever elected to that chamber. She launched her candidacy for president to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland at the beginning of last year. But the senator failed to articulate a clear rationale for her campaign, and gave muddled answers to questions in key policy areas like healthcare.

6657,DOJ: Yale Discriminates Against Asian American and White Applicants In Admissions,"Here and Now The Department of Justice accused Yale University of violating federal civil rights law by illegally discriminating against Asian American and white applicants in its undergraduate admissions process. Those are the findings of a two-year investigation conducted in response to a complaint by a coalition of Asian American groups. The Justice Department notified university officials in a letter on Thursday. ""The Department of Justice found Yale discriminates based on race and national origin in its undergraduate admissions process, and that race is the determinative factor in hundreds of admissions decisions each year,"" the department said in a release. It went on to say that ""for the great majority of applicants,"" Asian American and white prospective students have 1/10 to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials. In a statement provided to NPR, a Yale spokesperson said that the university ""categorically denies this allegation."" ""At Yale, we look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit among the many thousands of highly qualified applicants,"" the statement said. ""We take into consideration a multitude of factors, including their academic achievement, interests, demonstrated leadership, background, success in taking maximum advantage of their secondary school and community resources, and the likelihood that they will contribute to the Yale community and the world."" The spokesperson also suggested that the Justice Department had not fully taken into account the information and data that university officials were providing. ""We are dismayed that the DOJ has made its determination before allowing Yale to provide all the information the Department has requested thus far,"" she said. ""Had the Department fully received and fairly weighed this information, it would have concluded that Yale's practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent."" The Justice Department acknowledged that the Supreme Court has held that colleges receiving federal funds can consider applicants' race in certain circumstances, as one of many factors. But it described Yale's use of race as ""anything but limited."" The Justice Department is alleging that Yale uses race at multiple steps of its admissions process, which multiplies the effect of race on an applicant's chances of getting in. It also said the school racially balances its classes. The department argued that such practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance. Yale ""expressly agrees"" to comply with that law as a condition of receiving millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, the department said. The Justice Department is demanding that Yale agree not to use race or national origin in its upcoming 2020-2021 admissions cycle. It also gives Yale an opportunity to propose a ""narrowly tailored"" plan for using race in future admissions cycles, pending Justice Department approval. Yale is not planning to modify its policies, according to its statement Thursday. ""We are proud of Yale's admissions practices, and we will not change them on the basis of such a meritless, hasty accusation,"" the university said. Art Coleman, an attorney and former deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights under the Clinton administration, raised questions about the strength of the Justice Department's case in an interview with NPR. ""The case here is thin at best,"" he said. ""Thin in terms of underlying evidence."" He compared Thursday's four-page Justice Department findings to the more than 100 pages a judge issued in a similar case regarding Harvard University, and noted ""that difference says a lot."" The Supreme Court has long upheld the use of race-based admissions in colleges, ruling on the subject as recently as 2016. Still, the Trump administration has repeatedly challenged the ability of higher education institutions to consider race in admissions decisions. Notably, in 2018, it withdrew Obama-era guidance that encouraged affirmative action in schools and universities. Mitchell Chang, an education professor at UCLA, said it is ""hard to imagine"" this latest move is not political, given its proximity to the general election in November. He also characterized it as at odds with the current social and political moment in which protesters across the country are calling for racial justice and equity. ""This move fails to respond to the calls being made nationally to consider race in a way that would help us address racism,"" Chang said. ""That's what affirmative action policies were meant to do. To increase access to elite higher education. This very much runs counter to that."" Disclaimer: Rachel Treisman is a graduate of Yale University.",0,0,1,4
6665,Asian Americans in Hollywood: The Effects of 20th Century Stereotypes,"Movies play such a huge role in our society today and influence the way that we look at the world. Hollywood movies are a representation of our society, a concrete reflection of the time we live in and what we value. Movies are a way to tell one story to millions of people around the world. With that power, movies can create, reflect, and perpetuate stereotypes, and can mold the way that society sees a certain people group. For Asian Americans in the early 1900s to the late 1960s, the stories being told about Asian people by Hollywood were overall pretty negative. In a society that rejected change and actively worked against anything different from the status quo, the portrayal of Asian people in Hollywood films was a direct reflection of what White Americans thought of Asian people at the time. As a young, movie-loving Asian American in the 21st century, to me these movies feel like ancient history, stories from long ago that have no more cultural relevance in todayтАЩs society. While that could be true in some respects, racism and discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans continue to persist in America today, and Hollywood remains a good representation of what that looks like. While anti-Asian racism may not be as blatant as it was before, it still persists, and knowing its roots helps us understand where it comes from, why it took hold, and how we can combat it. Chinese people were the first major Asian immigrant group to establish themselves in the United States back in the 1850s during the California Gold Rush, and many families here can trace their origins back to that time. While initially welcomed with open arms, anti-Chinese sentiment quickly rose as large groups arrived seeking a better life in America. They were willing to work for lower wages at jobs that few White Americans wanted, such as field workers, launderers, and housekeepers. With few тАЬrespectableтАЭ jobs available for Chinese immigrants, they were at the bottom of the social ladder in a White dominated society; this was the cost of being an Asian in America. Yet despite the low social standing of Chinese people in society, White Americans began to feel threatened by their presence and their тАЬdeviationтАЭ from what was тАЬnormal.тАЭ As sentiment shifted and open hostility towards Asian people in America grew more and more present, the U.S. government passed the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting any more Chinese immigrants from entering America. This was the first ever act passed prohibiting an entire ethnic group from immigrating to the U.S. Hollywood, rather than combatting the prevalent anti-Asian sentiment, reflected and perpetuated the overall distrust of Asian people through films such as The Cheat (1915), The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu (1929), and The Thief of Baghdad (1924); pushing the narrative that is now known as тАЬyellow perilтАЭ. Yellow peril was the idea that Asian people from the East threatened the Western way of life and sought ways to destroy it. Through the eyes of Hollywood, Asian people, namely Chinese, played very few and very subordinate roles in movies and in real life. In addition, since Hollywood, and people in general, were distrustful of Asian people, when showing an Asian character in films, Hollywood used yellowface. Yellowface refers to a non-Asian actor portraying an Asian character with the use of makeup, prosthetics, and costumes to give them тАЬAsian featuresтАЭ or an тАЬAsian look.тАЭ This look was based on heavily exaggerated stereotypes, such as small/slanted eyes, large teeth, and a flat nose while wearing тАЬAsian lookingтАЭ costumes. While this is clearly racist, yellowface in Hollywood continued to be common because a White actor might express a casting preference or interracial contact had to be minimized due to laws prohibiting it. In addition to leaning on heavy stereotypes when portraying the look of an Asian person, Hollywood also saw the тАЬessenceтАЭ of Asian people in a limited number of typecasts. The most frequently used typecasts for Asian characters in the early 20th century were the Lotus Blossom, the Dragon Lady, and the Fu Manchu. The Lotus Blossom, also sometimes referred to as the тАЬChina Doll,тАЭ is a stereotype of Asian women as being passive, docile, and subservient тАФ characteristics that were for the purpose of pleasing a White man. At the same time, the Lotus Blossom is also cast as being sensual, mysterious, and exotic; something new and unfamiliar to the White male. Since the role of the Lotus Blossom is to be subservient to whatever the White man needs, she is often hypersexualized, as she exists just to please the sexual desires of a White man. Some examples of the Lotus Blossom in early 1900s films are Lotus Flower in The Toll of the Sea (1922), Cho Cho-San тАЬButterflyтАЭ in Madame Butterfly (1915 and 1932), Katsumi in Sayonara (1957), and Suzie Wong in The World of Suzie Wong (1960). Although more common in the 1900s Hollywood era, the idea of the Lotus Blossom still lives on today, both in movies and in our society. Movies from the 1970s to early 2000s continued featuring the Lotus Blossom in many popular Hollywood movies. These classic movies influenced many late Boomers, Generation X, and early Millennials in their most impressionable years on the definition of an Asian American woman and how sheтАЩs тАЬsupposed to act.тАЭ The people being influenced by these stereotypical roles grew up to become our parents, grandparents, teachers, politicians, etc., who influence who we, as young Asian Americans can become. The existence of the Lotus Blossom stereotype contributes to the continued hyper-sexualization and fetishization of Asian and Asian American women. I have noticed that, especially in the modern dating scene, people still perceive Asian American women as тАЬexotic,тАЭ passive, and obedient in relationships; character traits not as commonly expected from women of other races. This, in part, contributes to the phenomenon known as тАЬYellow Fever,тАЭ a preference for Asian people in the dating world based on harmful and untrue stereotypes. The stereotype of the Dragon Lady falls on the complete other end of the character spectrum in some ways, yet still shares certain traits with the Lotus Blossom. Instead of being docile and subservient, the Dragon Lady is a dominatrix: powerful, manipulative, and seductive. While in juxtaposition to the weak and helpless Lotus Blossom, the Dragon Lady is also hyper-sexualized, again to fulfil White sexual fantasies. The Dragon Lady is strong and in charge, exuding feminine charm and seductive energy; almost toying with male characters using her power. Representing two opposite ends of the spectrum, there is little representation of Asian females anywhere in between the Lotus Blossom and the Dragon Lady, especially in the early 1900s Hollywood movies. Some examples of the Dragon Lady in films of that era are the Mongol Slave in The Thief of Baghdad (1924), Ling Moi in Daughter of the Dragon (1931), and Hui Fei in Shanghai Express (1932). These two stereotypes were essentially the only types of representation that Asian females received in Hollywood at the time, with very few, if any, roles outside of these two typecasts. As typecasts, both roles are extremely one-dimensional, with little deviation from the racist stereotype and no character development. Similar to the Lotus Blossom, the Dragon Lady stereotype and its effects continue to live on in mainstream media and our modern society. With little mainstream representation of anything in between the Lotus Blossom and the Dragon Lady, people assume that Asian women fall under one or both of those categories. Since both of these stereotypes fetishize and hyper-sexualize Asian women, it is possible that these stereotypes contribute towards men of all races finding Asian women to be overall most desirable in the dating world compared to women of other races. In 2013, researchers took data from the Facebook app Are You Interested, reviewed 2.4 million heterosexual interactions, and found that men of all races (except Asian men) prefer Asian women. Since it is likely that the preference comes in part from inaccurate stereotypes, a result is that Asian women become targets for sexual harassment and are forced to navigate around fantasized perceptions of who they are. While the Lotus Blossom and the Dragon Lady are stereotypes for the Asian female, the stereotype of the Fu Manchu was one of the few roles for Asian males. The Fu Manchu stereotype comes from a 1913 series of novels by Sax Rohmer (1883тАУ1959). In тАЬThe Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu,тАЭ which revolves around the evil doings of the dastardly villain and evil scientist Dr. Fu Manchu, Dr. Fu Manchu repeatedly tries to gain world dominance for China and attempts it by any means necessary. The series was eventually adapted into 15 short films and 3 Hollywood movies. Dr. Fu Manchu was described by Rohmer in the first novel as тАЬthe Yellow Peril incarnate in one man.тАЭ This type of character, an Asian man set on destroying the American way of life, became the embodiment for the Asian male in the eyes of White Americans. The Fu Manchu character also perpetuated the тАЬothernessтАЭ of Asian people, implying that they will always be different and тАЬforeignтАЭ and can never be considered American. Some examples of the Fu Manchu in early 1900тАЩs films are Haka Arakau in The Cheat (1915), General Yen in The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933), and Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). Personally, I think the legacy of the Fu Manchu, out of the three stereotypes, has the strongest effect on our society today. While the Lotus Blossom and the Dragon Lady are, for the most part, stereotypes primarily existent in media, the core characteristics of the Fu Manchu continue to hold strongly in peopleтАЩs perception of Asian Americans today, 100 years later. The Fu Manchu stereotype revolves around the idea that Asian people are loyal to their тАЬhomeтАЭ country and will do anything to advance the interests of the тАЬmotherlandтАЭ, even if it means destroying the Western way of life. This stereotype was not only destructive when it originated in the early 20th century, but it continues to contaminate the minds of people now, causing them to believe that all Asians are loyal to their тАЬhomeтАЭ country. This is most visible in the common question that all Asian Americans get asked at some point in their life, тАЬWhere are you REALLY from?тАЭ Implying that we are not American, but rather hold roots in a foreign country. This shows that regardless of how тАЬAmericanтАЭ you are, because of the color of your skin, you can never be a тАЬtrue American.тАЭ As a 5th generation Japanese American, whose family first came in 1907, I am as American as they come, and yet still face racial prejudices that say I donтАЩt belong and should тАЬgo back to [my] home country.тАЭ The Fu Manchu stereotype enhanced the idea of тАЬotherness,тАЭ and has long prevented Asian Americans from being seen as American. The Fu Manchu gave a face and a set of characteristics to Asian people that has outlived many other stereotypes of its time. The Lotus Blossom, Dragon Lady, and Fu Manchu characters reflected and enforced peopleтАЩs negative perceptions of Asians, putting Asians into tiny boxes as to what and who they could be. Although the stereotypes of Asian people in 1900тАЩs Hollywood feels so long ago, these stereotypes continue to persist in todayтАЩs society and are reflected in todayтАЩs movies. While not as blatant and outright racist as they used to be, Hollywood has evolved and found more subtle ways to work these stereotypes into the Asian characters they portray. Understanding these stereotypes and where they originated from is important in being able to dismantle them and move into a new era of Asian representation in Hollywood films.

6725,Asian Americans make up 1% of Emmy nominations. Why is representation so low?,"Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Critics are pointing out that a number of Asian American and Pacific Islander casts and creators have been overlooked in this yearтАЩs Emmy nominations. Strong front-runner contenders include тАЬNever Have I Ever,тАЭ тАЬAwkwafina Is Nora from Queens,тАЭ тАЬPatriot Act With Hasan Minhaj,тАЭ as well as performers from various shows including Hong Chau from тАЬWatchmenтАЭ and Michelle Krusiec from тАЬHollywood.тАЭ Asian Americans account for 1 percent of all nominees in the Emmy awards this year, which airs Sunday. ThatтАЩs a decrease from 2 percent over the last 10 years, according to a recent NBC News analysis. Some experts believe that a lack of recognition for Asians at the Emmys is attributable to the fact the offerings may still be considered too niche and lacking mainstream appeal, especially because of the rapid growth of television content. Mindy Kaling, who created the Netflix comedy тАЬNever Have I EverтАЭ about an Indian American family, tweeted on the day the Emmy nominations were announced that despite high viewership and critical acclaim, the comedy will always seem niche or ethnic to some people. Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist who writes on pop culture, agreed. тАЬThe older generations may see Asian American led shows as niche or even foreign and not consider them for Emmy nominations.тАЭ тАЬShows featuring Asian Americans may be popular among younger generations who grew up with a diverse group of friends, but the voting members tend to skew older,тАЭ she told NBC Asian America. тАЬThe older generations may see Asian American-led shows as niche or even foreign and not consider them for Emmy nominations,тАЭ she said. The Television Academy did not respond to requests for comment. There is some progress to point to. Sandra Oh scored a third consecutive nod for her lead role in тАЬKilling Eve,тАЭ while Dev Patel made his nomination debut for his guest role on an episode of тАЬModern Love.тАЭ Director Andrij Parekh was nominated for his episode of тАЬSuccession.тАЭ Despite these nominations, experts agree there is still a long way to go. In the past few years, television shows led by or featuring Asian Americans have included popular comedies like тАЬFresh off the Boat,тАЭ тАЬThe Mindy Project,тАЭ тАЬDr. KenтАЭ and тАЬMaster of NoneтАЭ to newer programs like тАЬWu Assassins,тАЭ тАЬNever Have I Ever,тАЭ тАЬWarriorтАЭ and тАЬPen15. But they are still rare. Yuen co-authored a report called тАЬTokens on the Small ScreenтАЭ in 2017 that noted white characters make up nearly 70 percent of series regulars compared to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who were at 4 percent, of which Pacific Islanders occupy only 0.2 percent. She said her research found that historically, television depicts Asian characters in less complex ways than their white counterparts. тАЬCompared to white characters, Asian characters are less likely to have familial and romantic relationships on screen. They also have less screen time,тАЭ Yuen added. тАЬConsequently, Asian actors have had very few opportunities to shine.тАЭ Yuen noted that there is improvement since the survey, but the number of shows featuring Asian American leads remain low compared to the sheer amount of shows featuring white leads. As a result, the Television Academy members may not be aware of them or seen them at all. Poorna Jagannathan, who stars in KalingтАЩs Netflix comedy, said that nominated and awarded shows attract viewership, more money and more support. They lead to more work, which is scarce for Black and brown creatives to begin with. тАЬItтАЩs meaningful to get visceral reactions from fans of the work, but I also canтАЩt denigrate the worth and importance of these institutions and their need to redeem us.тАЭ She cited HuluтАЩs тАЬRamyтАЭ тАФ led by an Egyptian American тАФ in which she had a recurring role for the first season last year. It wasnтАЩt recognized at the Emmys but the show won a Peabody, and its creator and star, Ramy Youssef, won a Golden Globe in 2019. The comedy-drama faced some criticism for its representation of Muslim women. This year, Youssef and his season two co-star Mahershala Ali are both Emmy nominees. Jagannathan also starred in the South Asian-led HBO miniseries тАЬThe Night Of,тАЭ which was nominated for an Emmy in 2017. Her co-star Riz Ahmed won for his leading role, the first actor of South Asian descent to win a lead acting Emmy. (Before him, Archie Panjabi won best supporting actress in a drama for тАЬThe Good WifeтАЭ in 2010.) In terms of off-screen representation, Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang were the first Asians to win a writing award for тАЬMaster of NoneтАЭ in 2016. Ansari won the same award in 2017 with co-writer Lena Waithe. Maya Erskine was nominated for writing an episode of тАЬPen15тАЭ with her co-star Anna Konkle and Stacy Osei-Kuffour. Jagannathan said she finds the inequality in the nominations, especially for Asians and Latinos, staggering. тАЬWhen any award show is called out for their overwhelmingly white nominations, the conversations become very White-Black. This binary leaves out Hispanics and Asian Americans,тАЭ she added. Writer and speaker Phil Yu, who created the culture blog Asian Angry Man as a platform to discuss representation in mass media, said that the deluge of content due to the rise of streaming services means inclusive shows can be shoved into their own category as opposed to being seen as ""prestige."" тАЬThe Emmys or even the Oscars is the last stop on the train line to acknowledge excellence,тАЭ he added. тАЬItтАЩs necessary to create a space for Asian American content to exist and for that to be supported in the first place.тАЭ Yuen said that there needs to be a concerted effort on the part of studios and networks or even grassroots efforts to campaign for these Asian-led shows and Asian actors. According to Jagannathan, тАЬThe Night OfтАЭ deservedly got attention because of the established white people behind it, including creator and director Steve Zailian, writer Richard Price, HBO and BBC. тАЬWe had a big marketing campaign, the academy watched us,тАЭ she said. тАЬThe real story is what happens to shows that are written and led by teams that are not the establishment. ItтАЩs easier to dismiss them even though they get critical acclaim and viral audiences."" When the #OscarsSoWhite campaign took off, it led to an examination of diversity in films but also of the voting body that judges the awards. Jagannathan said a similar reckoning might be needed for the Emmys. тАЬThe ground is shifting beneath us,"" she said. ""Awards shows must meet this movement accordingly."" ┬й 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",0,0,1,2
6740,Vietnamese biggest pro-Trump group among Asian Americans - VnExpress International,"According to a July 4 - September 10 survey of 1,569 Chinese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Filipino American registered voters across the U.S., 48 percent of 264 Vietnamese wanted Trump to be the next president, while just 36 percent said they would vote for Biden. With less than two months until the presidential election, this makes Vietnamese Americans the biggest Asian group that supports Trump. The survey findings were released Tuesday by the Asian Americans Advancing Justice тАУ AAJC, Asian and Pacific, Islander American Vote (APIAVote) and AAPI Data. They showed a majority of Asian Americans, or 54 percent, planned to vote for Biden compared to just 30 percent Trump. Indian Americans are the most inclined to vote for Biden among all Asian American groups at 65 percent, the survey found. Around 14 percent of Asian American registered voters remained undecided about their presidential vote choice. Majorities of Asian American registered voters also said they will support Democratic over Republican candidates in House and Senate races and again, the exception to this trend of Democratic support were Vietnamese American voters, who on the whole are more likely to support Republican candidates for House and Senate than Democratic candidates. For the House, 45 percent of Vietnamese Americans said they prefer Republican candidates while 32 percent chose Democrats. The corresponding proportions for the Senate were 56 percent for Republican and 23 percent for Democratic candidates. Compared to previous elections, 54 percent of the Asian American registered voters said they were more enthusiastic about voting this time. The Asian Americans also expressed some concerns about the November election being free and fair. Almost half said they worry about the possibility of election interference. An equal number were worried about the health and safety implications of voting in-person at the polls over the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a consequence, most Asian American registered voters said they prefer to vote by mail or by absentee ballot, compared to just 26 percent who wanted to vote in-person on election day. Karthik Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy founder and director of AAPI Data, said: ""Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the country and weтАЩve seen voters make an impact at the polls. This group saw a record high level of midterm election turnout in 2018."" Asian Americans showcase a wide diversity in terms of national origin, geographic region, religion, and English-language proficiency. They also demonstrate cohesion on healthcare, immigration, the environment, guns and education. Asian Americans favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, stronger environmental protections, gun control, and affirmative action. They are likely to believe that the Democrats handle most issues better than the Republicans, with the exception of taxes and ""jobs and the economy,"" the survey found. ""These new data demonstrate that, despite considerable diversity by ethnicity, the Asian American community is largely united when it comes to support for the social safety net, environmental protection, and gun control,"" Janelle Wong, senior researcher at AAPI Data noted. ""Organizations working on these issues need to make sure they include Asian Americans in their outreach,"" she said. ┬й Copyright 1997 VnExpress.net. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
6742,A Black radio host calls on South Asian Americans to reject racism,"Skip to content Khafre Jay taught himself Hindi so he could call out acts of racism by Indian Americans on his radio show. He touched on a subject many Indian Americans don't talk about: the prevalence of anti-Black attitudes in the South Asian community. The World September 03, 2020 ┬╖ 10:45 AM EDT Listen to the story.┬а Khafre Jay, the executive director of Hip Hop for Change, based in Oakland, says he has experienced anti-black actions from Indian Americans when visiting his in-laws in Sunnyvale, a suburb of the Bay Area that is majority South Asian. Matt Rogers/The World Exasperation drenched radio host Khafre JayтАЩs voice as he spoke between tunes on a recent edition of his Sunday afternoon hip hop show. His visits to see family in Sunnyvale, a Bay Area suburb with a large and fast-growing South Asian population, infuriated him. тАЬPeople walk past me like they're afraid,тАЭ said Jay, who is Black. тАЬSometimes people cross the street and then when they get past me, then they cross back.тАЭ But worse, he said, were the times when тАЬpeople [called] the police on me,тАЭ assuming he was up to no good. Asians make up almost half of SunnyvaleтАЩs population, while Blacks comprise less than 2%. The mistreatment Jay experienced came from Indian Americans, he said. тАЬThere are so many brown people here in Sunnyvale, I donтАЩt know why I should be experiencing racism down here... like, we should be walking hand-in-hand. We face the same white supremacy on a daily basis.тАЭ тАЬThere are so many brown people here in Sunnyvale, I donтАЩt know why I should be experiencing racism down here...like, we should be walking hand-in-hand. We face the same white supremacy on a daily basis,тАЭ Jay said. Jay, who is the executive director of the nonprofit Hip Hop For Change, decided to speak out about it. During one July radio show, broadcast across the Bay Area on public radio station KPOO, Jay went on a bilingual offensive, throwing out Hindi lines he learned on Google to express his frustration. тАЬWhy are you staring at me?тАЭ Jay attempted in Hindi. тАЬDo you know that I'm a human being?тАЭ His radio rant came a few weeks into the nationтАЩs deep reckoning with systemic racism in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis. тАЬThe most beautiful thing about what's happening after George Floyd is so many white folks out in the streets fighting for Black liberation,тАЭ he said. Indian Americans, too, have come out to protest racism. Within days of FloydтАЩs death, South Asians in Palo Alto organized a racial justice solidarity protest by spreading the word on Facebook. Yet in protests from Oakland to San Francisco, the South Asian community has not been a large or organized presence.┬а Nilesh Junnarkar, left, Esha Junnarkar, center, and Anushka Junnarkar take part in a racial justice protest organized by Indian American groups in Palo Alto, California, on June 5, 2020. Courtesy of Priya Junnarkar Related: How Indian Americans are reacting to Kamala Harris as Joe BidenтАЩs VP pick What Indian Americans often donтАЩt talk about is exactly what Jay called out on the radio: the prevalence of anti-Black attitudes in the South Asian community. This is perhaps one reason more Indian Americans have not joined the protests. тАЬThere is a problem, and we need to address that in the South Asian community,тАЭ said Basab Pradhan, who runs a Bay Area theater company that stages plays for the Indian community. Part of the problem among Indians in this part of California is a lack of exposure to Black Americans within their own communities, says Pradhan, a Bay Area resident of many years. тАЬThere are places in the Bay Area, like Fremont, like Sunnyvale, like Cupertino, where the density of Indians is so high that you just glom onto that instead of widening your social circle,тАЭ Pradhan said. Furthermore, many Indians in the Bay Area work in the tech sector, and Silicon Valley companies employ low rates of Black people. Pradhan says Indian Americans in the Bay Area tend to have higher incomes and may believe issues like police brutality just donтАЩt affect them. In 2017, his theater company staged a play about police brutality that provoked intense questions about justice and impunity. The play refused to sanitize how African Americans have been brutalized by the police. Yet attendance was low, Pradhan said.┬а Actors Paul Costello, left, and Nabil Awad perform in a play ""Counter Offence,"" that tackles police brutality and was staged at the Bay Area Drama Company. The theater's co-artistic director Basab Pradhan said the play was not well-attended. Courtesy of Bay Area Drama Company PradhanтАЩs wife, Vidya, also works to raise consciousness within the Indian community. тАЬMisinformation thrives in a vacuum,тАЭ she said. тАЬIf you have no information about the history of Black people, then it's going to be filled in by whatever comes your way.тАЭ HollywoodтАЩs negative stereotypes of Black men can take hold, Pradhan says. She recently held workshops about Black history for Indian American children. Parents were interested, too, she said, and that gives her hope that this moment of racial justice reckoning might be opening some hearts and minds in the Indian American community. Yet Basab Pradhan points out anti-Black sentiment among Indian Americans may be connected to something far deeper: IndiaтАЩs entrenched caste system, which traces its roots to a rigid hierarchy present in Hindu scriptures. The priestly class, Brahmins, sit at the top, while Dalits are subjected to the bottom rung. Related: The US isnтАЩt safe from the trauma of caste bias Indians of higher castes hold many of the same stereotypes about lower caste Indians that whites hold about Blacks in the US, Pradhan says. Brahmins often believe lower castes to be lazy and not smart, and to get jobs or college placements due to affirmative action programs in India rather than their own smarts. Pradhan says itтАЩs a challenge to erase these beliefs. тАЬThe education system [in India] does not work to blunt caste divisions in India, it works to cover it up. Then you come here and you take that system in your head and you apply it to your new country and it results in prejudice against Black people or Hispanic people.тАЭ тАЬThe education system [in India] does not work to blunt caste divisions in India, it works to cover it up,тАЭ Pradhan said. тАЬThen you come here and you take that system in your head and you apply it to your new country and it results in prejudice against Black people or Hispanic people.тАЭ Although discriminatory practices by upper-caste Brahmins against lower-caste Dalits are against the law in India, they happen in plain sight. Caste discrimination also takes place within the Indian community in the US. A survey by a nonprofit Dalit civil rights group, Equality Labs, found that two-thirds of the respondents felt discriminated against in their workplace due to their caste. Related: Netflix's тАШIndian MatchmakingтАЩ stirs conversation about tradition, colorism and caste In a landmark case brought in June by the state of California, regulators are suing tech firm Cisco Systems, accusing it of discrimination against an Indian American engineer because of his lower-caste status. The company has denied the allegations. The Cisco case has brought to light more stories from Dalit Indians of caste discrimination at US workplaces. Software engineer Maya Kamble said she has experienced it a lot. тАЬI never could imagine that I would face the caste system after coming to the US,тАЭ she said. тАЬItтАЩs not so easy when you have an Indian manager. Managers have a lot of control over what kind of bonuses you get, whether you get promoted or not.тАЭ Kamble says she recently left a job because of the hostile work environment created by her Indian manager. Yet, caste discrimination against Dalits is something that has brought lower-caste Indian Americans to identify strongly with other oppressed communities in the US, according to Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs. тАЬDalits have been really pushing the rest of the South Asian community that if you want to really show up for Black lives, you have to work on your internal hegemonies of caste and that will really change the way that you show up for all oppressed peoples.тАЭ тАЬDalits have been really pushing the rest of the South Asian community that if you want to really show up for Black lives, you have to work on your internal hegemonies of caste and that will really change the way that you show up for all oppressed peoples,тАЭ she said. Dalit South Asian Americans have a long history of solidarity with African American communities, Soundararajan said. There were the Dalit Panthers, who were directly inspired by the Black Panthers. And famous Dalit leader, Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, reached across the ocean from India to build solidarity with Black Americans, she said. тАЬThis goes back many years from the correspondence between W.E.B. Dubois and Dr. Ambedkar about the possibilities for engagement at the UN [United Nations] for issues of caste and racial justice,тАЭ Soundararajan said.┬а Khafre Jay says he wants Black and brown communities to stand in solidarity against racism. Matt Rogers/The World Khafre Jay, the hip hop community organizer, often invokes the same Black thinkers and activists on his show. тАЬPart of me is pissed at the [Indian American] community out here for excluding me and making me feel so unwelcome, and using the man and the dogs of the man to police me,тАЭ he said. Yet Jay also wants to express solidarity. And heтАЩs not giving up on learning Hindi. тАЬAs a Black dude looking like me speaking Hindi, I think my biggest point to the Indian community would be like, тАШHey, we have to fight because oppression for anybody becomes oppression for everybody.тАЩтАЭ Want a seat at the table?

They have a big wave in the middle and they say тАЬAsian Americans for Jesse Jackson.тАЭ In Santa Clara county, we had a campaign office at 3rd and San Carlos in downtown San Jose and one on the east side. I was in the Nihonmachi Outreach Committee and the NCRR working on the redress campaign, and I and many others felt that JacksonтАЩs campaign was historic. He was the only presidential candidate to endorse redress for JAs. It was also a chance to see and feel the possibility and reality of a multi-ethnic, multi-racial coalition for equality and justice. There were Chicanos/Latinos, Black people, Iranian Americans, Asian Americans and white people, and there were a lot of young people working on the campaign. We canvassed door-to-door and put up signs. I remember doing security at a rally at Independence high school in SJ and Rev. Jackson came to speak. I remember really feeling it when we repeated after him, тАЬI am тАжsomebody!тАЭ The Black, Latino, and Asian kids at the rally felt it, too, I know. I stood in back of a row of students and Rev.

6847,AAPI leaders to celebrities honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg ├втВмтАЬ AsAmNews,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg honored by civil rights leaders and celebrities as the nation gears for a battle over her replacement. By Louis Chan, AsAmNews National Correspondent The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may not have had a direction connection to the Asian American community, but her passing touched many AAPIs nonethless. тАЬAdvancing Justice тАУ AAJC mourns the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,тАЭ said John Yang, Executive Director of the Washington DC-based civil rights group said. тАЬShe was a pioneering champion for gender equality and a tireless protector of civil and human rights for all people in this country. Her voice will be sorely missed.тАЭ Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris(D-CA) said тАЬtonight we mourn, honor and pray for justiceтАЭ for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.тАЭ Tonight we mourn, we honor, and we pray for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. But we also recommit to fight for her legacy.Doug and I send our heartfelt prayers to Jane and James, and the entire Ginsburg family, particularly on this holy day of Rosh Hashanah. pic.twitter.com/SNyqZCznfv The Progressive Vietnamese American Organization also issued a statement to mourn her passing.┬а Actor and activist George Takei joined in honoring Ginsburg legacy. My heart is broken. RBG, we did not deserve you. Actress Mindy Kaling remembered her gentle demeanor, her fierce determination and her guiding spirit. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the kind of scholar and patriot you get excited about explaining to your kids. The kind of person who you say тАЬwho knows, one day you could be HERтАЭ. I hope you rest well, RBG, you must have been tired from changing the world. The nation gathered in candlelight processions to honor her memory-from the Castro District in San Francisco to the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. Behind the mourning, a backdrop of heavy handed politics emerged. President Trump quickly announced he would push forward a nomination to replace Ginsburg just six weeks before the presidential election. RELATED: RBG AND ME: THE IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN OF COLOR It was a not a surprising, but a bold move nonetheless, given that in 2016, the Republicans refused to even hold committee hearings on President ObamaтАЩs nomination to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, nine months before the presidential election. Senator Majority Leader Mitch OтАЩConnell (R-KY) argued that the American people should decide who will be given the opportunity to nominate the next Supreme Court Justice. GOP Judiciary Committee chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) fiercely backed that position. Today both are taking on a different tone, a fact not forgotten by many including Vanita Gupta of the The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. тАЬI want you to use my words against me. If thereтАЩs a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said letтАЩs let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination."" pic.twitter.com/quD1K5j9pz Pressure is already mounting on moderates in the Republican majority to follow GrahamтАЩs words.

6892,Asian American support for Black Lives Matter still strong ├втВмтАЬ AsAmNews,"Support weakening for Black Lives Matter, but still strong among Asian Americans and Blacks Black Lives Matter mural in Minneapolis in front of an Asian market. Photo by Adam Chau Support for the Black Lives Matter movement among Asian Americans remains strong, despite weakening nationwide. A new survey conducted this month by the Pew Research Center found more than two out of three, 69 percent of Asian Americans, say they support BLM compared to 55 percent of the country overall. The strongest backing comes from Blacks themselves with 87 percent, followed by Asian Americans and Hispanics with 66 percent. Just 45 percent of Whites embrace BLM, plummeting from 60 percent in June. Hispanic support dropped 11 percent from June. Asian American support dipped 6 percent. Support from Blacks remained stable, increasing 1 percent. The poll did not analyze why support has fallen, but a separate poll may provide an indicator. Awareness of news stories about clashes between police and protesters is significantly higher than awareness of other stories. Eight out of ten Americans surveyed by Pew say theyтАЩve heard a lot about violent protests, compared to 64 percent about mail in voting, 49 percent about cuts in the postal service and 40 percent about a stimulus bill. Republicans and Whites are most likely to believe coverage of protests over racial equality is too much. 39 percent of Asians say the news has given such protests the right amount of attention. 36 percent say its too much attention.

Featured guests on the episode will include Armando Huipe (Producer, Latinx Theatre Commons), Maki'ilei Ishihara (Company Actor, Honolulu Theatre for Youth), and Jonathan H. McCrory (Artistic Director, National Black Theatre). The episode will be hosted by Leslie Ishii (Artistic Director, Perseverance Theatre, Juneau, AK; Board President, CAATA) and Moses Goods (Founder & Artistic Director, ╩╗Inamona Theatre Company, Honolulu, HI; Board Officer, CAATA). The second episode of CAATA's ConFest Virtual Series monthly online series, titled ""Modeling Solidarity: Theater As Political Action"" will broadcast on Monday, September 14, 2020 at 1PM HST, 3PM AKDT, 4PM PDT, 5PM MDT, 6PM CDT, and 7PM EDT. The episode will focus on building coalitions between BIPOC theatre communities in this time of pandemic, revolutionary social change, and economic collapse. The speakers will call for both learning from our Elders and the making of intergenerational connections for collaboration and political action in the service of justice. These prominent BIPOC theatre leaders will come together to share what it means to be vulnerable, to support each other's healing, and to build true solidarity. The episode is part of CAATA ConFest's Virtual Series exploring the theme of the upcoming 7th Biennial Asian American Theater Festival & Conference (ConFest) ""Ku╩╗u ╩╗─Аina, Ku╩╗u Piko, Ku╩╗u Kahua - Return to the Source"" in Honolulu, Hawai╩╗i in May 2021. The in-person ConFest will center the voices of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander theater practitioners, and feature the thriving theater community of Hawai╩╗i, where Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander faces on stage are the norm, not the exception. ""Ku'u '─Аina, Ku'u Piko, Ku'u Kahua - Return to the Source"" is a call to all theatre artists to reconnect with their foundations and their sources of knowledge: their land, their family, their center. The online series and its presentation of the wide diaspora of Pan Asian/Pacific Islander/MENA/Native/Indigenous American stories will be a vehicle through which both the audience and artists can ground themselves in their cultural knowledge and the many identities that we bring to our communities. ""Future episodes of the series will feature artists from across the country who represent some of the most groundbreaking work in American theatre, and includes stories from across the breadth of the Pan Asian/Pacific Islander/MENA/Native/Indigenous American diaspora, including Hawai╩╗i, Egypt, Vietnam, and more,"" said CAATA ConFest Co-Chairs Leilani Chan (Founding Artistic Director, TeAda Productions) and Tammy Haili'┼Нpua Baker (Associate Professor, Department of Theatre and Dance, University of Hawai'i at M─Бnoa). They added, ""This series is not meant to be a replacement for the conference and festival, but is an offering to begin discussions around artists, topics and themes proposed by the field that we hope will culminate in celebration when we are able to gather in person again next year. Our goal is to also continue dialogue with other BIPOC networks of color and connect artists with current BIPOC movements."" The ConFest Virtual Series is being produced in partnership with HowlRound Theatre Commons in Boston, MA, a nonprofit organization that operates as part of Emerson College╩╗s Office of the Arts. HowlRound provides a free and open platform for theatre-makers worldwide that amplifies progressive, disruptive ideas about the art form and facilitates connection between diverse practitioners.

In putting together this list and its rankings, I took a look at quantity, critical acclaimed films and cultural impact (i.e films that moved the culture). Not to take anything away from other well known directors such as Spike Lee, the late John Singleton, Gina Prince-Bythewood, George Tillman Jr., and Lee Daniels, they have spent the last decade working on bringing exciting subjects to the small scene. 1.Ryan Coogler Coogler has emerged as the most prominent director with just three films. With Fruitvale Station, he won the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He then co-wrote and directed the seventh film in the Rocky series, Creed. That grossed nearly $175M worldwide and then he helmed MarvelтАЩs Black Panther, which not only broke numerous box office records, but also became the highest-grossing film of all time by a black director. 2. Tyler Perry When the decade started, there was no consistent director making films and bringing in big box office receipts other than Tyler Perry. Love them or hate them, his films brought in an audience that no box office expert had seen before. Led by his signature character, Madea, folks couldnтАЩt get enough laughs. HeтАЩs one of the few directors who also writes and produces his projects, which brings in average gross of at least $60M and generates a 2-1 return on his investment. 3. Jordan Peele With just 2 films to his directing credits, Jordan Peele has catapulted himself among this list. His feature film debut, Get Out, shook the world when it came out in 2017. A $4M budget for a horror film that starred relatively unknowns (Daniel Kaluyya, Alison Williams) in, the film grossed a whopping $280m worldwide and a became a cultural phenomenon. For his follow up Us, it became the highest grossing original film in 2019. 4. Steve McQueen McQueen had three films in this decade (Shame, 12 Years a Slave, and Widows) but it was 12 Years a Slave that made him the first Black director to have a film win Best Picture. McQueen makes gritty stories that are very in your face and very revealing in the character study. The public can see the soul of the character through the eyes of his lead actors/ actresses. 5. Barry Jenkins It had been over a decade when Jenkins had released his first film, Medicine for Melancholy, to critical acclaim. There was great anticipation for his next film Moonlight and when it came out in 2016, it not only captured everyoneтАЩs attention, but went on the win the Academy Award for Best Picture. This was the first time a film with an all-Black cast took such an honor and he also won an original screenplay Oscar. His next film, тАЬIf Beale Street Could TalkтАЭ also garnered critical acclaim. 6. Ava DuVernay In this decade, DuVernay reinvented herself from film publicist to film director and she got her big break when she won the directing award in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival for her second feature film Middle of Nowhere, becoming the first black woman to win the award. Her second film, Selma, garnered her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director, and she also the first black female director to have her film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2017, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for her film 13th. In 2018, her film A Wrinkle in Time grossed over $100M at the box office, making her the first black female director to have that distinction. 7. F. Gary Gray F. Gary Gray had been relatively quiet in the beginning of the decade until he came back to the directorтАЩs chair with the NWA film Straight Outta Compton in 2015. Featuring mostly newcomers as part of the cast, this musical film did very well critically and financially. It not stood atop at the box office for 4 straight weeks, but it also grossed over $160M. Gray then went to direct the eighth installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise, The Fate of the Furious in 2017. With a total gross of $1.2B, it became the 18th highest-grossing film of all-time. With his last film being 2019тАЩs Men in Black International, Gray is one of the few Black directors getting films with a $100M plus budget. 8. Antoine Fuqua Fuqua has been a muscular filmmaker who does action packed films that have been successful at the box office, includingThe Equalizer franchise with Denzel Washington doing his first sequel. Having done Southpaw and The Magnificent Seven remake to critical and financial success, letтАЩs not forget that his direction of Olympus Has Fallen sparked two more sequels. 9. Tim Story Story is probably by quantity the most successful Black filmmaker when you throw in the Fantastic Fours from the previous decade to his successful run with the Think Like a Man and Ride Along franchises. One can say heтАЩs a chameleon filmmaker who shows his versatility whether itтАЩs action packed or comedy driven. He can work and do well in both fields. 10. Malcolm D. Lee Having worked over 15 years in the business, Lee finally gave us the sequel to his film debut Best Man with Best Man Holiday and it proved well at the box office, and then hit a home run with Girls Trip, which is one of the funniest Black films of the decade and introduced us to rising star Tiffany Haddish. Haddish went to star with Kevin Hart in LeeтАЩs box office hit Night School. See more Your email address will not be published.

Carlos MontagueDiversity OfficerMaryland Wing CAP recognizes Women's History Month with a profile of aviator and civil rights pioneer Willa Brown. There are many pioneering names in African American aviation. Figures like Eugene Bullard, Bessie Coleman, Charles Alfred Anderson, John Forsythe, Thomas Allen, Janet Harmon Bragg and Herman Banning all set out against the odds of social and racial injustice, to achieve excellence. And then thereтАЩs Willa Beatrice Brown Chappell, a pioneer for both womenтАЩs equality and civil rights. Brown was born in Glasgow, Kentucky, in 1906 to a biracial family with a Native American mother and an African American father. Understanding that education was important, Brown graduated from the Indiana State Normal School, now Indiana State University, majoring in commerce and earning her bachelorтАЩs degree in business. Later she would receive a masterтАЩs degree in business administration from Northwestern University and became a teacher at Roosevelt High School in Gary, Indiana. Eventually she moved to Chicago and became a social worker. тАЬAny time you are a first in anything, thatтАЩs a challenge. Willa Brown was the first African American woman in the United States to get a private pilot license, get licensed and certified as a mechanic, and earn a commercial pilotтАЩs license,тАЭ said the Rev. Sandra Campbell, a former manager with the Federal Aviation Administration. During a time when women were generally not expected to be professionals, she was probably one of the first to step out and be herself, fighting through the same obstructions as most African Americans of that period. Brown later met Cornelius Coffey, who sparked her love of aviation. She worked with Coffey in his flying school, training under his encouragement and later marrying him. The two co-founded the first private pilot training academy on the south side of Chicago, the Coffey School of Aeronautics, owned and operated by African Americans. When the couple started the aviation school, they taught anyone who wanted to learn to fly and support aviation. They were still operating in a segregated environment, so there werenтАЩt a lot of opportunities. Brown got the idea that maybe the government could be convinced to allow more blacks to get pilotтАЩs licenses and even serve in the military as pilots. She became a catalyst for integrating the armed services. Those who knew her said her education and no-nonsense attitude were legendary. She was tough but fair. An excellent administrator and instructor, she challenged men much taller and significantly larger than her, encouraging them to get the task done because she took a keen interest in their success. She trained hundreds of pilots and was selected by the U.S. Army Air Corps to provide black trainees for the Pilot Training Program at the Tuskegee Institute, many of whom went on to become Tuskegee Airmen. Brown dedicated her life to helping others, and not just in the field of aviation. She was active in all aspects of her community, working to help people realize their dreams and strive for excellence, demonstrating that you could do anything and be anything that you set your mind to be. During World War II, she became the first African American officer in Civil Air Patrol and also served on the newly formed U.S. Aviation Board Commission. Brown died July 18, 1992, at age 86.

She is survived by her wife, Dr. Gwen Zornberg, and her children, James and Alexandra McCown. тАЬJudge Batts was a beloved member of our community and will be greatly missed. We are grateful to her for her brilliance, passion and friendship. As the first African American to receive tenure at Fordham Law and the first openly LGBTQ federal judge, she broke barriers and opened doors,тАЭ said Matthew Diller, Dean of Fordham Law School. тАЬSince joining the federal bench, we have been fortunate to hold on to her as a superb teacher of trial advocacy and a dear friend. She was a mentor to students and faculty alike.

1741,Simone Biles hesitant to compete in 2021 Tokyo Olympics - TheGrio,"For some, 50 years may seem like a long time, and for others, 50 years is not nearly long enough. This year, Oxford College is celebrating 50 years of African American graduates and 30-plus years of MLK Scholars in a special 30-50 Celebration. тАЬIt could have been earlier, nevertheless itтАЩs still a milestone that we want to recognize,тАЭ says Oxford Chaplain Lyn Pace, who serves on the Oxford Celebrations Committee, a group formed to plan events and programs for the 30-50 Celebration. тАЬThis is an important marker, even though itтАЩs not necessarily a long period of time. ItтАЩs important to know our history and know our path moving forward as a college.тАЭ Campus Life Dean Joe Moon, who serves as a historian for the college, recently recognized that 1970 was the year that the first African American students graduated: Anthony Garfield Gibson, John Robert Hammonds, and Angela Yvonne Jinks. They first entered Oxford in 1968 under Dean Bond Fleming. тАЬWe have had four black students; their cooperation, their scholarship, and their leadership have been a blessing and an inspiration,тАЭ Fleming wrote in his annual report for 1969-1970. During their time at Oxford, the students were on academic merit lists, members and leaders in various council groups and, for Gibson and Hammonds, part of the Air Force ROTC. Jinks also was president of the Women's Advisory Council. The year to celebrate the graduates also is a good time to merge the celebration with recognizing more than 30 years of MLK Scholars, Pace says. Given annually, the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship is a four-year, full tuition scholarship to Oxford College and Emory University. It is awarded to a student from Newton County based on financial need and merit through an application process. The student must maintain a 3.2 GPA to keep the scholarship. тАЬ[Attending Oxford] wasn't something that I thought about doing at first, but once I got here, I fell in love with it,тАЭ says Chris Ejike, this year's Oxford Scholar, who is a graduate of Newton High School and the Newton County College and Academy. тАЬI enjoy getting to know all of my classmates and working closely with my professors. I really like the community base.тАЭ Ejike, who plans to major in nursing, admits he was skeptical about living close to his hometown, but now he enjoys being able to go see his mom whenever he wants to. тАЬShe respects my privacy too,тАЭ he says. Events for the 30-50 Celebration kicked off on January 21 with the college's annual Martin Luther King Jr. celebration at historic Old Church. The speaker was alumna Sonya Tinsley-Hook 89Ox 91C, who was OxfordтАЩs first MLK scholar. Tinsley-Hook is the founder of the All Our Strengths project, which teaches people how to be тАЬstrengths championsтАЭ in their schools, communities, and organizations. Prior to the event in Old Church, a dinner in Phi Gamma Hall honored all the MLK Scholars and their families. The centerpiece of the 30-50 Celebration is BlackOUT Alumni Reunion Weekend, which will be held February 21 to 23. It will feature a special brunch, a performance from Oxford student group Voices of Praise Gospel Choir and alumni speaker Gerald Griggs 98Ox 00C. тАЬ[The committee] wanted to organize some events that would highlight black alumni over the years,тАЭ Pace notes about the decision to feature Oxford graduates from various decades at various 30-50 Celebration events. On display throughout the 30-50 Celebration is a special exhibit in the Oxford College Library, Framing Shadows, curated by Kimberly Wallace-Sanders, associate professor of American studies and African American studies in Emory University's Department of African American Studies. The exhibit is a prelude to her forthcoming book, Framing Shadows: African American Women and White Children in Domestic Portraiture. She also is author of the 2007 book Mammy: A Century of Race, Gender and Southern Memory. The exhibit in the Fran Elizer Exhibit Space features portraits of nannies, or тАЬmammies,тАЭ from 1840 to 1920 from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection, as well as texts and illustrations from EmoryтАЩs Rose Library's book and manuscript collections. Other 30-50 Celebration events include a Jericho Brown Reading in the student center at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 25, Black History Movie Night in the student center at 6:30 p.m. March 5, an oral history booth at April 18's Oxford College Alumni Weekend, and a campus-wide book drive, which Madison Redd, a second-year student from Houston, Texas, is organizing to help local elementary school students. Redd recently worked at Mainstay Academy, an alternative public school in Newton County near the college, to assist students with class and homework. She wants to present books to students at Mainstay as well as other Newton County schools. тАЬI hope to inspire a change in how we help our community and also encourage more students to read,тАЭ says Redd, who is currently studying educational studies, philosophy, and politics and law at Oxford. A few of these 30-50 Celebration events coincide with February's Black History Month events, some of which are annual. Some events are new, and are due in part to Anthony Mize, who has served as OxfordтАЩs director of diversity and inclusion since 2018. тАЬThere are a lot of great things going on at Oxford that focus not only on African American students but more minority groups,тАЭ Mize says, adding that diverse events help represent more of the Oxford community better and help all students prepare for a more global experience. тАЬIt's about diversity, inclusion, equality at Oxford, but also in the community and around the world.тАЭ In addition to the BlackOUT Alumni Reunion Weekend, Black History Month events at Oxford kicked off February 3 with a National Pan-Hellenic Council Showcase. The month also includes programs such as free HIV testing and a Men's Etiquette and Tie Relay Race.

1989,White Women are the Worst: To the Karens and Amy Coopers of America,"Senators voted unanimously Monday to create a task force to find abandoned African American cemeteries, backing up a budget agreement Sunday to fund memorials. That measure (SB 220), offered by Tampa Democratic Sen. Janet Cruz, would create the Task Force on Abandoned African American Cemeteries to study forgotten or abandoned cemeteries across the state. Additionally, the bill calls on the Department of State to continue counting graves at the former Zion Cemetery in her hometown. Cruz told the Senate she cares deeply about the city and its history. тАЬThat also moves me to recognize the parts of our history that includes hate, divisiveness and tragedy,тАЭ Cruz said. тАЬA good community does not run from its history. Our state should not run from our history either.тАЭ She says nearly 3,000 such cemeteries have already been identified across the state. Cruz and Sen. Darryl Rouson, a St. Petersburg Democrat, said they hope to ensure dignity and respect for the deceased now left unmemorialized. тАЬThough we cannot look into their eyes, we cannot talk to them. But we can tell their stories. This task force will begin to do just that,тАЭ Rouson said. Cruz, Rouson and Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson successfully proposed an amendment to the Senate General Appropriations bill (SB 2500) that would set aside $100,000 for memorials at Zion and Ridgewood cemeteries. The House and Senate ultimately agreed to that deal after leaving it out of initial budget talks. Both cemeteries served as burial grounds for the African American community during the segregation era. Graves at both sites have since been built over. Zion Cemetery now serves as a backyard to Robles Park Village public housing. Researchers have already found death certificates for 382 people buried at the site between 1913 and 1920 as well as 120 coffins. The Secretary of State will lead the task force and appoint representatives from the Bureau of Archaeological Research in the Division of Historical Resources, the NAACP, the Florida Council of Churches, the Florida African American Heritage Preservation Network, the Florida Public Archaeology Network, the cemetery industry and a local government. The Senate President and House Speaker would select one lawmaker each to round out the task force. тАЬFloridaтАЩs history is incredibly unique. But it has been incomplete for too long,тАЭ Cruz said in a statement. тАЬI am humbled to have the opportunity to advocate for those who have been forgotten from our stateтАЩs history and I look forward to seeing all of the great work this task force will accomplish.тАЭ House legislation (HB 121), carried by Reps. Fentrice Driskell and Dianne Hart, was not scheduled for a committee hearing. In Jacksonville, where a Department of Transportation (FDOT) project conflicted with a cemetery years gone, federal and state legislators clamored for action. According to Action News Jax, U.S. Rep. Al Lawson is pushing to have the remains of African American veterans moved to the Jacksonville National Cemetery. Their graves were disturbed by the FDOT project. тАЬThis is pretty significant. [ItтАЩs] especially disturbing where the remains of veterans are laid and so we [have] got to do more,тАЭ Lawson said. Lawson is readying federal legislation.

3102,Reebok cuts ties with CrossFit over CEO's insensitive 'Floyd-19' tweet,"  African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at disproportionate rates. At the same time, we are less likely to even be tested. We are less likely to be treated for the virus. And we are more likely to be low-wage essential workers on the front lines, putting us at greater risk for contracting the virus. If that doesnтАЩt make you want to weep, you might want to check your pulse. Me? I donтАЩt know whether to laugh or cry. Structural inequalities that make this even possible have long existed. But this may be the first time, thanks to the coronavirus, America is forced to deal with the staggering health care and economic disparities that afflict communities of color. ItтАЩs commonly known, for instance, that African Americans suffer disproportionately from cardiovascular-related diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, all the things that make us more susceptible to succumbing to COVID-19.  But itтАЩs also the case that African Americans, particularly those of lower economic status, have a much more tenuous connection to health systems and to health care professionals, said Alford Young, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan. Thus, he said, they are more inclined to rely upon themselves when assessing their health rather than seek the care of a health care professional. RELATED | Everything you need to know about coronavirus тАЬNot only do many live in densely populated areas where itтАЩs hard to social distance, but they also live in households that are more crowded than the homes occupied by more privileged Americans,тАЭ Young said. тАЬThose more crowded homes are also smaller in size. Hence, low-income African Americans and others without financial resources struggle mightily with the challenge of trying to isolate and maintain social distance.тАЭ Last week, President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged for the first time the racial disparity during a White House task force briefing. тАЬWe are doing everything in our power to address this challenge, and itтАЩs a tremendous challenge,тАЭ Trump said. тАЬItтАЩs terrible.тАЭ RELATED | Outbreak apparently taking heavier toll on blacks With few exceptions, numbers documenting the disproportionate spread are hard to come by, but hereтАЩs what we know right now from news reports: In Louisiana, African Americans are 32% of the population but account for 70% of deaths from the coronavirus. In Michigan, they make up 14% of the population but 40% of COVID-19 deaths. And in Illinois, they are 15% of the population but 42% of deaths. Credit: Screenshot via DeKalb County Credit: Screenshot via DeKalb County Dr. S. Elizabeth Ford, district health director of DeKalb County and interim district health director of Fulton County, said a review of statewide data from the Georgia Department of Health shows that as of April 6, African Americans, in some cases, outnumber those contracting COVID-19 and dying by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. тАЬItтАЩs pretty shocking,тАЭ she said. RELATED | Why Grady doctor makes plea for us to stay home so she can go to work Of the 1,200 COVID-19 cases reported in Fulton County, more than 900 donтАЩt have racial data. Of the 299 that did identify by race, Ford said, 67%, or 201, identified as black; 27%, or 82, identified as white; and 5%, or 16, identified as Hispanic. In DeKalb County, the numbers were even more striking. Of the countyтАЩs 709 known COVID cases, only 125 identified by race, but of those, 24, or 19%, were white; 92, or 74%, were African American; and 9, or less than 1%, were other. Among the dead in DeKalb, only 5 out of 11 identified by race тАФ 20% were white, 80% were African American. Those numbers were not available for Fulton County.   Statewide, there have been more than 4,500 COVID-19 cases reported as of April 6, but only 2,040 people identified by race. Of those, 52% were African American, 42% identified as white and 6% identified as other. According to the most recent census, blacks make up 32% of GeorgiaтАЩs population and whites 60%. While the numbers are indeed troubling, Ford said COVID-19 is just one more blight in an already distressed community. тАЬI knew it would be uneven, but I didnтАЩt think it would be this dramatic,тАЭ Ford said. тАЬIтАЩve been a health director for 15 years, and I donтАЩt think anything has scared me more than this. Because this is a novel virus, weтАЩre learning something new every day, so how we address it changes nearly every day.тАЭ RELATED | From slavery to mass incarceration? WhatтАЩs clear is that in addition to having weakened immune systems due to chronic diseases, a lot of underlying issues such as access to health care and health coverage put African Americans at higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. тАЬRight now, the easiest way to get a test is from a referral from primary care physicians,тАЭ Ford said. тАЬIf you have no insurance, then you probably donтАЩt have a primary care physician, which impacts your ability to be referred for testing. Studies have also shown there are differences in how blacks are treated by health care professionals. I know thatтАЩs controversial to some, but itтАЩs true.тАЭ Dr. Sharrelle Barber, a public health professor at Drexel University who has spent the past 10 years researching racial and ethnic inequities in health, said the numbers of infected and dead African Americans from COVID-19 are probably even worse than we think.   тАЬWe know at least anecdotally that people have been turned away from hospitals when presenting with symptoms,тАЭ she said. тАЬSo, the numbers are tricky because we are not doing widespread testing and not everyone is tracking the data by race. If you arenтАЩt tracking the cases, you donтАЩt know.тАЭ Those essential workers that we keep hearing so much about arenтАЩt just doctors and nurses. They are blacks and Hispanics who disproportionately hold low-wage service jobs тАФ sanitation workers, store clerks and bus drivers тАФ and who are even less likely than doctors to have the proper personal protective equipment. But like doctors, they are returning home, only to put their family, friends and community at risk.

MINNEAPOLIS, May 30 тАФ The Minneapolis police officer accused of killing a handcuffed African-American man was charged with murder yesterday, but the move failed to quell surging anger as tense protests erupted in cities across the nation. Demonstrations raged from New York to Los Angeles, and from Atlanta where police cruisers were set ablaze, to Washington where protesters faced off with Secret Service agents outside the White House. In Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, the white officer filmed kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed and unarmed George Floyd for nearly nine minutes, was charged with one count of third-degree murder тАФ unintentionally causing a death тАФ and one count of negligent manslaughter. тАЬThis case is now ready, and we have charged it,тАЭ said county prosecutor Mike Freeman amid outrage over the latest death of an African American in police custody. But the charges failed to calm a shaken nation whose deep wounds over racial inequality have been torn open anew. Authorities imposed a curfew yesterday in Minneapolis after three nights of violent protests left parts of the city in flames. But protesters defiantly remained on the streets, sometimes dodging tear gas canisters fired into crowds by police. Protester Naeema Jakes said she needed to be on the streets so she could verbally confront officers. тАЬI need you to look in my eyes and feel me,тАЭ Jakes said. тАЬThis is pain, this is hurt.тАЭ The 46-year-old FloydтАЩs relatives тАФ who spoke yesterday with President Donald Trump тАФ welcomed news of the arrest as a тАЬstep on the road to justice,тАЭ but said they hoped for tougher charges and action against the other officers involved in FloydтАЩs detention and death. Freeman said the three other officers were also under investigation, and that he anticipated charges. All four were fired from the police department Tuesday after video surfaced of MondayтАЩs arrest. Troops deployed The announcement of charges came hours after hundreds of troops were deployed to the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul to try to prevent a fourth night of violent protests. Scores of buildings have been burned and looted across the so-called Twin Cities, including a police station associated with the four officers. Mayor Jacob Frey declared a night-long curfew yesterday and today as protesters appeared on the streets in Minneapolis again yesterday.

And we want to see the other officers arrested,тАЭ they said in a statement. тАЬThe pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America.тАЭ The third-degree charge though reflected the official autopsy saying that even though Chauvin held his knee to FloydтАЩs neck for two minutes and 53 seconds after he became тАЬnon-responsive,тАЭ Floyd did not die of asphyxiation or strangulation. After attacking the protesters as тАЬthugsтАЭ and threatening to send in federal troops to deal harshly with them, Trump shifted tone later yesterday, announcing he had called FloydтАЩs family to express his тАЬsorrow.тАЭ тАЬI understand the hurt, I understand the pain.

4880,Jason Mitchell to star as Sean Bell in new biopic '50 Shots' - TheGrio,"KTLA by: Associated Press Jackie Lacey holds a news conference at the Hall of Justice on March 2, 2020. (KTLA) For nearly three years, Melina Abdullah has led dozens of demonstrators once a week outside the Hall of Justice to call for the ouster of Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey for failing to prosecute killings by police officers. Thousands more joined Abdullah after George FloydтАЩs death. Chants of тАЬJackie Lacey must go!тАЭ echoed between the courthouses downtown several days this month. Demonstrators hoisted signs saying, тАЬProsecute Killer CopsтАЭ and тАЬBye Jackie!тАЭ and read the names of some of the more than 340 people killed by LA County law enforcement officers during the eight years Lacey has been DA. In every case but one Lacey has found a shooting justified or decided not to bring charges because she concluded the officer could win an acquittal at trial. тАЬEverybody is utterly shocked when they think about the number of people who have been killed by police or while in custody since Lacey took office,тАЭ said Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter-LA. She criticized LaceyтАЩs substantial financial support from law enforcement organizations for appearing to be тАЬa quid pro quo.тАЭ Lacey is the first Black person and woman to serve as Los Angeles district attorney. She is seeking a third term in November and has taken note of the recent crowds, saying тАЬthe weight of them and the number of people is substantial, to say the least.тАЭ But she is less concerned about the impact of demonstrations than about being misunderstood. тАЬI donтАЩt want people thinking IтАЩm biased or racist or afraid, or any of these very unflattering things that are said,тАЭ Lacey told The Associated Press. тАЬWe shouldnтАЩt assume that everyone who says тАШBlack lives matterтАЩ isnтАЩt concerned also about public safety. ThatтАЩs a false choice that those are mutually exclusive.тАЭ Lacey fell just shy of getting the majority of votes needed to get re-elected in a March primary against two contenders running to the left of her on platforms to reform the criminal justice system. She faces a runoff against George Gascon, the former San Francisco district attorney and longtime Los Angeles police commander, who was a distant second. The death of Floyd, a Black man who cried out that he couldnтАЩt breathe as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee to his neck for over eight minutes, has ignited protests across LA for more than three weeks. Protesters want dramatic reforms to the criminal justice system, and that demand could shape the DAтАЩs campaign. Lacey, who grew up in South Los Angeles and worked her way up through the ranks in the nationтАЩs largest local prosecutorтАЩs office, is seen as the institutional law-and-order candidate. Gascon, who immigrated to LA from Cuba as a teen, has billed himself as a progressive reformer. Gascon has not joined the protests, but quickly condemned the death of Floyd and police abuses. He has tweeted and issued press releases supporting rights of protesters and denouncing their arrests for curfew violations while calling on Lacey to continue not seeking bail in low-level, nonviolent criminal cases after a statewide order imposed during the coronavirus pandemic was rescinded. Lacey didnтАЩt issue a statement until six days after Floyd was killed and has been a step behind Gascon in announcing she wonтАЩt prosecute curfew violators and will continue to not seek bail for less serious offenses. тАЬShe is so obviously reacting to the political pressure of the election,тАЭ Gascon said. тАЬBut the motivation behind that is not driven by her concerns and her desire to be thoughtful and humane but theyтАЩre really motivated by campaign politics which tells me that if she were to be re-elected she would go back very quickly to being who sheтАЩs always been.тАЭ GasconтАЩs campaign, which was largely funded in the primary by outside contributions from a pair of wealthy Northern California donors, has seen a spike of interest since the protests started. HeтАЩs got 200 new volunteers and raised over $160,000, mostly in donations averaging $20, according to his campaign. Lacey, who got most of her primary support indirectly from police unions, has criticized Gascon for not prosecuting police for shootings during his time as San Francisco DA, though his spokesman, Max Szabo, said none of those cases involved unarmed suspects. The union representing Los Angeles Police Department officers spent $1 million to torpedo Gascon in the primary as a тАЬcon manтАЭ and failed leader who fled San Francisco before his term expired. HeтАЩs been criticized for authoring a law that reduced some felonies to misdemeanors, not charging enough misdemeanor cases and for a steep rise in San Francisco property crimes, mostly car break-ins. Violent crime in San Francisco during his tenure rose 15%, though it jumped 31% in Los Angeles County during most of LaceyтАЩs time in office, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. Lacey points to her record prosecuting two dozen officers for unlawful use of force and for currently being the only DA in the state to have a case pending against an officer in a killing тАФ a manslaughter charge against a sheriffтАЩs deputy. Having law enforcement support at a time when protesters are calling for defunding police could hurt Lacey, said Eric J. Miller, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School. тАЬBefore it used to be a net positive in the days of law and order, and by that I mean two months ago,тАЭ Miller said. тАЬBut now, тАШIтАЩm supported by the police unionтАЩ or more possibly Black Lives Matter saying, тАШThe police union supports Lacey,тАЩ is a very different signal.тАЭ Lacey has been criticized for not bringing charges in several high-profile police killings of unarmed suspects, including one involving Brendon Glenn, a Black homeless man who had accosted patrons of a bar in Venice and was shot as he struggled with officers who were trying to handcuff him. Then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck had called for criminal charges in the case, but Lacey said she didnтАЩt think she could win a conviction. Tyrone Howard, an education professor who heads the Black Male Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that given the тАЬlong ugly historyтАЭ LAPD has had with Black and Latino communities, there was hope Lacey would be different from her predecessor, who never charged an officer with an on-duty shooting. From the standpoint of holding police accountable, he said: тАЬI think thereтАЩs been widespread disappointment that with her as an African-American, the first who has been in that seat, that that has not happened to the degree that people think that it should have,тАЭ Lacey said FloydтАЩs death has forced her to consider dusting off an idea she shelved to remove police departments from investigating their own officers in shootings, though she knows that will not be popular with chiefs. Lacey said sheтАЩs tried to have discussions with Black Lives Matter, but the members want to meet in larger forums, where she has been heckled and shouted down. Protesters even showed up at her doorstep before dawn the day before the March primary, prompting LaceyтАЩs husband to pull a gun on Abdullah and threaten to shoot. The incident is under investigation by the state attorney general. Black Lives Matter does not endorse candidates and Abdullah wonтАЩt say she will support Gascon. тАЬWe canтАЩt say that because weтАЩre going to have to protest him too, IтАЩm sure,тАЭ Abdullah said. тАЬI just know that itтАЩs impossible to be worse than Lacey.тАЭ Submit Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

5106,Tiffany Haddish getting advice from Tyler Perry to realize dream of owning movie studio - TheGrio,"Highlighting тАЬracism and coronavirusтАЭ misses fatherlessness and abortion in the black community. An NBC News report asserted this week, тАЬNew York protesters say they are facing two deadly pandemics: racism and coronavirus.тАЭ The obtuse piece sought to use New York protesters to juxtapose the threat of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 20,000 New Yorkers and 110,000 Americans, with the тАЬneedтАЭ of black individuals to protest against supposed тАЬsystemic racism.тАЭ As we have noted repeatedly, hard data simply does not support the LeftтАЩs claims of widespread racism, let alone anything even remotely equating to тАЬsystemic.тАЭ While the article fell far short of presenting any legitimate conundrum, it did ironically serve to expose the absolute hypocrisy of the leftist Black Lives Matter crusade. One of the leading protest organizers, Chelsea Miller, hit on this hypocrisy without realizing she was doing so. In attempting to address the challenge of protesting during the China Virus pandemic, Miller asserted, тАЬWe have reached a crux where we must choose between potentially losing our lives at the hands of the police or the pandemic. In many ways weтАЩre choosing between the lives of our unborn sons and those of our parents.тАЭ Obviously, in referencing the lives of unborn sons, Miller inadvertently alluded to the genuine pandemic тАФ a genocide, in fact, that has been meted out on the lives of preborn babies with decimating effects, especially on the black community, over the decades. Even more tragic is the fact that in New York City, less than half of preborn black babies live to see the light of day. Planned Parenthood may lament тАЬviolence against black lives,тАЭ but the nationтАЩs largest abortion mill terminates 247 black lives every day тАФ all in service to the eugenics agenda of its venerated racist founder, Margaret Sanger. In fact, more 20 million black children have been aborted, which is more than the entire black population in America during the 1960тАЩs Civil Rights movement. Irrespective of what Miller and the Left may claim, there is no pandemic of racist police brutalizing the black community; there is, however, a pandemic of preborn babies being killed in their mothersтАЩ wombs. The ones who survive are often left fatherless, which arguably is another pandemic for the black community. The sad reality is that the primary threat to the lives of black Americans comes not from COVID-19 or from law enforcement but from other black Americans. Blaming police and faux тАЬsystemic racismтАЭ are simply a means for deflecting attention away from the real root of problems plaguing so many black communities.

5645,"Trump secretly ridiculed Christian supporters, aide says - TheGrio","By World Tribune on July 23, 2020 by WorldTribune Staff, July 23, 2020 A black Marine Corps veteran, who lives one block away from the federal courthouse in Portland that is being besieged by rioters, said Antifa thugs followed him home after he marched into the chaos while displaying his American flag, a report said. тАЬFor more than 50 nights, Gabriel Johnson, 48, a retired Marine, has been kept awake by the sounds of rioting and explosions taking place outside his window in Portland,тАЭ Fox News reported on Thursday. тАЬAfter two months of living in fear, at 3 a.m. Sunday he had had enough.тАЭ Johnson said: тАЬAt that point I [had] counted 82 explosions and just thought, you know, somebody has to do something.тАЭ When he entered the chaotic scene while holding his American flag, Johnson said he knew his actions would be more than a little divisive to the leftist mob. But the retired Marine said he was not prepared for the reaction he received. тАЬI was being called the N-word by Black people. People were chasing me around with baseball bats,тАЭ Johnson told Fox News. тАЬAntifa has infiltrated Black Lives Matter,тАЭ Johnson said as he described a woman dressed in Black Lives Matter gear who showed him threatening footage of protesters following him back to his home, and letting him know they were keeping tabs on him. According to Johnson, the woman was also holding an Antifa pen and was communicating with others via walkie-talkie. тАЬThese people have nothing to do with Black lives. Our Black community leaders need to stand up and lead because whatтАЩs happening is theyтАЩre letting a group of terrorists that donтАЩt represent me use me, and thatтАЩs not right,тАЭ said Johnson. Johnson said a 65-year-old Black veteran had stepped in to attempt to stop the burning of JohnsonтАЩs flag, only to be beaten by members of the mob. тАЬHe said, тАШthereтАЩs no way youтАЩre gonna burn this flag.тАЩ That was followed up by Black Lives Matter, Black men, running after this man, punching him in his face, grabbing the flag and throwing it over the fence,тАЭ Johnson told Fox News. тАЬI look at everything from a patriotтАЩs point of view. IтАЩve spent a lot of time fighting for our country. And so my belief in and my patriotism for this country is unmeasured тАж I fought for this country and this is not what I fought for,тАЭ said Johnson. The lifelong Portland resident blames the destruction of his city on the inaction of local leadership. тАЬThe lack of police response, city response, response from our mayor has just given free rein to holy hell to take place at that 11 oтАЩclock hour to 3 in the morning.тАЭ As for the federal officers who have been sent by the Trump administration into Portland over the past week to end the violence, Johnson doesnтАЩt oppose the extra assistance. тАЬIn absence of the local police what do we expect?тАЭ he said. тАЬIf we as a city arenтАЩt going to police ourselves, then we should expect someone to come in and police for us.тАЭ Intelligence Brief __________ Replace The Media anarchists, Black Lives Matter, Black Marine who carried American flag into Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa, Black Marine who displayed American flag amid Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa, Gabriel Johnson, WorldTribune.com  Black Marine who carried American flag into Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa added by World Tribune on July 23, 2020View all posts by World Tribune тЖТ (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Want to help revive the Free Press in America?

Kathryn Jones at her Nampa home, Tuesday, June 30, 2020, Brenda Hambrick, owner of B&B Soul Food, prepares food for the pop-up vendor. Hambrick plans to join the new African American Chamber of Commerce. Subscribe  NAMPA тАФ Kathryn Jones, a Nampa business owner, said there is no Treasure Valley organization where African American business owners can professionally meet and organize. ThatтАЩs why Jones this month is launching a new chamber of commerce that seeks to bring together Black business owners, not only in the Treasure Valley but across the state. Jones, 39, owns Shaved Head Productions, a project management company, and is the founder and president of the African American Chamber of Commerce, a new chamber that is not affiliated with any larger organization. Jones said she started the organization for two reasons. First, Black business owners in Idaho need a professional business resource. Second, Jones said she was angered by the тАЬsituationтАЭ of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, two African American men, whose deaths, perpetrated by white men, have sparked nationwide protests against racial injustice. тАЬI was really, really angry, but I didnтАЩt really have anywhere to focus that anger,тАЭ Jones told the Idaho Press in a phone interview. тАЬThe Treasure Valley didnтАЩt really have a place for African Americans to meet professionally, so I thought this was a great opportunity to launch the chamber, that way we have somewhere to share our voices. And it gave me somewhere to focus my anger and be productive and help in the Treasure Valley.тАЭ The new chamber may have been jump-started, in part, by recent events, but its founder has long-term aspirations тАЬRight now, itтАЩs trendy to support Black-owned businesses, and itтАЩs trendy to support Black people,тАЭ Jones said. тАЬBut what the chamber wants to do is affect what youтАЩre doing day to day to support the Black businesses in your area. ThatтАЩs one of the things I think weтАЩll see happening is people daily supporting Black-owned businesses versus supporting them when itтАЩs trendy.тАЭ Like other chambers, the African American Chamber of Commerce will help business owners find training opportunities, secure grant funding, apply for Small Business Administration loans and advocate for legislation at the Statehouse. But the African American chamber will provide resources to meet the individual needs of Black business owners, Jones said. тАЬAfrican Americans in the Treasure Valley тАж thereтАЩs no organizations that focus on their needs specifically,тАЭ she said. тАЬBecause of that I wanted to make sure that they have a place to go, to get resources, to go to get information. We help connect people with other organizations, other Black-owned businesses or other businesses in general that can help them get their business to the next level, whatever that is.тАЭ For Brenda Hambrick, a 53-year-old from Boise, the chamber could elevate the status of her two businesses as well as increase business development and economic growth within the African American business community and the areaтАЩs business community as a whole. тАЬCurrently, the only way you put your business out there is by social media, website, word of mouth,тАЭ said Hambrick, who owns B&B Soul Food, a pop-up food vendor, usually located at the Chow Public Market and Eatery, and LumperтАЩs Moving Service, a moving and cleaning company. тАЬI would love to know that my business is being reflected with the chamber,тАЭ Hambrick said. тАЬI just feel like it says itтАЩs more professional, and that we have a goal. WeтАЩre not just out here as a тАШpop in, make some money, and then youтАЩre goneтАЩ type of place. I want my business to be structured right here, to show that it has grown and that you can do it. So many people go in business and then they go right back out because they donтАЩt know what to do or they donтАЩt have the help of some type of organization or someone thatтАЩs willing them to give them the opportunity or the resources or the tools to make it successful.тАЭ Hambrick said Black business owners in the area are excited about the new chamber, and she knows several local business owners that plan to join. Hambrick decided to join when she saw Jones posting about the African American Chamber of Commerce on Facebook. тАЬI thought, тАШYou know what, I want to be a part of that,тАЩтАЭ Hambrick said. тАЬтАЩI want to help whatever will help grow our community, educate our community, bring us together as a wholeтАЩ тАФ thatтАЩs what caught my eye about it, especially with the things that are going on in the world. I just wanted to see what I could do to help while IтАЩm still here.тАЭ The African American Chamber of Commerce will begin accepting members Aug. 1. Chamber staff includes a vice president, Gabrielle Davis, and director, Shari Baber, as well as a board of directors. Jones said chamber leaders havenтАЩt decided where the chamber office will be located. Board members live across the state, from Coeur dтАЩAlene to Twin Falls, and leaders donтАЩt want membership to be exclusively Treasure Valley businesses, Jones said. According to data from the Small Business Administration, in 2012 there were 571 small businesses in Idaho owned by African Americans. Jones expects many businesses will engage with the chamber, but she anticipates membership will grow slowly while the organization builds trust within the African American community. тАЬI think itтАЩs something that the community has been waiting for for a long time,тАЭ she said. тАЬI do think that the growth will be slow because in the Treasure Valley, when it comes to organizing African Americans тАФ a lot of times there are a lot of promises and no actions. I know that theyтАЩll be wary about what is going to happen with the chamber, what the chamber is going to do. There are going to be times where we have to do a lot of things тАж showing that weтАЩre here to do it before people, especially African Americans, really invest in what the chamber can do.тАЭ While the new chamber prepares to launch, Jones said she is meeting with other organizations and chambers of commerce so that future members can benefit from community partnerships. Jones hopes the community understands that тАЬyou donтАЩt necessarily need to be African American to work with the African American Chamber of Commerce,тАЭ she said. The chamber will accept non-Black business owners as members, Jones said. тАЬI think itтАЩs important because allyship in the Treasure Valley is what sustains any business,тАЭ she said. тАЬYou have to build your business on those community partnerships. Making sure that those are the primary resources for the members of the chamber is very important.тАЭ Once the nonprofit is up-and-running with 501┬й(6) status, it will rely on grant funding and membership dues. In the meantime, the chamber is accepting donations at aaccofidaho.com/support-us. The African American Chamber of Commerce will host a virtual ribbon-cutting ceremony on July 13.

6692,Daymond John enlists celeb friends for global 'Black Entrepreneurs Day' - TheGrio,"Center for Health Journalism University of Southern California A year ago the word corona was associated with beer. And now look at where we have landed. Who would have thought we would wake up every day hoping that science will deliver us from this COVID nightmare? It can happen, but itтАЩs going to take some serious experimentation and patience to get us there. That means someone тАФ or many people тАФ will have to participate in clinical trials. Recruitment and participation in clinical trials is a sensitive subject for racial minorities. Can a safe, effective, desperately needed vaccine be created without our participation in research? Why is it so important that Black and Brown people donate their time and anatomy to science? Although the coronavirus has wrecked so many lives and trashed our economy, these questions are loaded and not easy to answer. Recruiting volunteers In a perfect world, scientists would recruit volunteers from several communities that represent a diverse population to participate in clinical trials. They would make a special effort to get volunteers from populations disproportionately affected by the targeted illness. Unfortunately, not everyone will eagerly volunteer. Blacks make up about 14% of total clinical trial participants in the United States, roughly proportionate to their representation in the population, though they are at higher risk of many serious illnesses. In clinical trials for cancer treatments, for example, participation of Black people runs low, though they have a higher death rate from cancer. According to a ProPublica analysis, Black participants accounted for fewer than 5% of patientswho took part in the studies that produced 24 of the 31 cancer drugs approved by theFood and Drug Administration over the last five years. Moderna, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, biotech company considered one of the front-runners in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, recently released data on the early-stage trial. Of the 45 healthy volunteers, 13% were Hispanic, 4% were Black, and only 2% were Asian. There is sufficient evidence that the coronavirus is hitting the African American community harder than others. Blacks and Hispanics have a greater chance of exposure for a number of reasons, including employment that is not remote-friendly and higher rates of underlying medical conditions. This suggests that nowhere is a vaccine of greater importance than in the Black community. But skepticism is a bitter pill to swallow. As a health journalist I mingle in different circles to see what people think about trending health topics. I spoke with a few health professionals about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine. тАЬIt would be extremely difficult to participate in a vaccine trial for COVID-19,тАЭ said Sharon Evans, an independent public health consultant in Raleigh, North Carolina. тАЬThe main reasons are there has been a lack of authentic transparency when dealing with this issue, lack of testing, inconsistent protocols, constant changes in information that is being disseminated.тАЭ Deidra Sorrell, a licensed clinical professional counselor in Waldorf, Maryland, rejects the notion of participating in clinical trials while questioning the origins of the virus. тАЬI realize that creating a safe vaccine requires a diverse group of participants for trials but I have an extreme distrust of anything associated with COVID-19. The origin of this virus is very sketchy in my opinion.тАЭ I spoke to Amer-Marie Woods, an African American neurophysiologist in Atlanta, about the lack of trust she has observed with her patients. тАЬI have had patients that refuse to talk to the (White) doctor but will talk to me. That shows that we need to see more Black doctors in these spaces.тАЭ Historical scars linger Whenever I hear discussions among Black Americans about clinical trials, there's a collective groan of disapproval. Everyone knows how the medical community has betrayed our confidence through clandestine experimentation. When researchers recruit in the Black community, a wall comes up. I spoke with a friend recently about COVID-19 trials. She worked to help recruit people from тАЬunderservedтАЭ and тАЬdisadvantagedтАЭ populations into clinical trials until she did a little research. Melva Florence, executive director of The LaStraw Inc., a community nonprofit in Greensboro, North Carolina, said she is now wary of talking people into volunteering for experimentation. тАЬWhen we are out here encouraging people to participate in vaccine trials, we have no way of assuring them that they will not be victimized,тАЭ she said. тАЬWe also canтАЩt in good conscience dismiss their concerns. The more I learned, the more foolish I felt. I actually felt like a foil. My Black face was being used to earn a trust in the medical field that they didnтАЩt earn and do not deserve.тАЭI reflect on the abuses committed by J. Marion Simms, the so-called тАЬfather of modern gynecology.тАЭ His claim to fame was developing surgical methods in the mid-1800s, such as gallbladder surgery and artificial insemination. But his experiments were performed on enslaved Black women who were not anesthetized. That painful reputation has carried on throughout the years. ThereтАЩs the infamous Tuskegee Experiment in the fall of 1932, in which Black men in the rural South were told they were being treated for тАЬbad blood.тАЭ In reality, scientists used them as human subjects to see what would happen when syphilis was left untreated. Then there is Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman in Baltimore who suffered from advanced cervical cancer. She died in 1951, but not before a White surgeon took samples from her tumors and used them to study human cell perpetuity. Her cells are responsible for developing many drugs and vaccines including the one that, ironically, is used to prevent cervical cancer. I also cringe as I think about the Eugenics Board of North Carolina. From 1929 to 1974, this state-approved board sterilized more than 7,600 people by force or coercion. They were mostly poor, Black young women who were victims of rape or incest, or born with a mental or physical disability. ItтАЩs only recently that these victims are being compensated, but not all of them will see the restitution they are due. In addition, thereтАЩs a continuous and contentious debate about using people in African countries to test vaccines. Many nations are still scarred from decades of experimentation. Recently, French researchers suggested that COVID-19 drug trials begin in Africa. The idea was rebuffed with the hashtag #Africansarenotguineapigs. If there is any question about the intentions of medical researchers, it is nearly impossible to suppress the communal anxiety that will surely grow. Why is it important to have racial minorities involved in clinical studies? On the other side of this debate is the integrity of scientific inquiry. Will a vaccine tested on White bodies react the same in other bodies? How can researchers reduce or eliminate the fear of science enough to recruit Black and Brown people to test a potentially life-saving vaccine? Black and Hispanic representation in clinical trials are traditionally low because of barriers such as mistrust, low health literacy, cost of transportation, child care, and possible missed work days. But homogeneous testing is discouraged in trials. In many cases patients of color will ultimately take the drugs developed in trials, so keeping them involved in the process is critical. Drugs and vaccines may not react the same among all ages, races and ethnicities. Florencia Gonzalez, Community Networks Manager at Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science (GHUCCTS), said it isnтАЩt normally good practice to apply test results so broadly. тАЬHistorically, people of color are underrepresented in clinical trials. I do feel that doctors are doing their best to include more minorities but it takes time. Unfortunately, there has not been any systematic tracking or study to ensure that diverse communities are being included.тАЭ The Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance and started an initiative on how to recruit more minority populations in trials. So, where do we go from here? Carla Williams, associate professor of medicine and public health at Howard University and co-director for community engagement at GHUCCTS, says safety is a priority. тАЬPeople have to feel safe, included and respected. Safety is always top of mind for both researchers and participants. ItтАЩs important that people know that there are strong safeguards in place to protect their safety and confidentiality. This includes a careful process of reviewing a research project before giving approval to start enrolling people in a study.тАЭ Gonzalez adds that creating videos, having translators on hand, and simplifying educational materials can lower the stress of trying to make a breakthrough. тАЬFor people with limited English proficiency, weтАЩre trying to ensure there is quality language and interpreters available to explain things clearly. We make sure that consent forms are translated. We try to consider the health literacy levels when creating educational materials.тАЭ GHUCCTS has recently published a blog post and a short video about the importance of getting Black and Hispanic people on board with clinical trials for COVID-19.

655,Democrat Bloomberg vows to narrow wealth gap for black Americans," By Jason Lange (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg on Sunday pledged to narrow the wealth gap between black and white Americans by boosting black ownership of homes and businesses and investing in poor neighborhoods. Bloomberg, a late entry to the Democratic nomination contest, is rising in public opinion polls as he uses his vast personal fortune to spend heavily on advertising nationwide. But the billionaire former mayor of New York trails frontrunners Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren nationally and among African Americans, who make up about a quarter of Democratic voters in the contest to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November election. Speaking in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the day before a holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., Bloomberg said his plans would help one million black Americans become homeowners over 10 years, while also boosting the number of black-owned businesses. He pledged a $70 billion program to fight poverty in 100 disadvantaged neighborhoods. """"You don't reverse hundreds of years of theft and exploitation only with some modern-day attempt to legislate equal rights,"""" Bloomberg said. He called his plan the """"Greenwood Initiative,"""" named after a prosperous black district in Tulsa that was razed in 1921 by a white mob which killed many dozens - and possibly hundreds - of blacks. The United States stands out among developed countries for its large wealth gaps and its relatively recent history of pervasive slavery, which underpinned its southern economy until 1865. According to researchers at the Federal Reserve https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201903-what-is-behind-the-persistence-of-the-racial-wealth-gap.aspx#D2, white American households on average had over six times the wealth of black households in 2016, a gap largely constant since 1962 despite legal efforts to ban discrimination. The Bloomberg campaign said his plan would help blacks with mortgage downpayment assistance and he pledged to fight discrimination with bias training for police, teachers and federal contractors. Bloomberg has faced criticism in black communities over his support of a controversial policing policy that ensnared disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos when he was New York's mayor. The former Republican apologized for the policy only a few days before announcing his candidacy in November. While the timing of the apology looked bad, Bloomberg's pledge to fight the racial wealth gap could still help him win votes, said Democratic strategist Douglas Wilson in Charlotte, North Carolina. """"It's a very good move on his part,"""" said Wilson. Bloomberg is not campaigning in the first four states to vote in the nomination process, including Iowa on Feb. 3, and hopes to make up ground on the """"Super Tuesday"""" March 3 contests that include racially diverse Texas, California and North Carolina. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Jan. 15-16 showed 9% of Democrats and independents backed Bloomberg in the nomination contest, up from 5% in early December. He trailed Sanders, who led with 20%, Biden who had 19% and Warren who had 12%. Biden has the most African American support with 23%, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling in the month through mid-January, compared to 17% for Sanders, 9% for Warren and 7% for Bloomberg.

1049,Birthright AFRICA is supporting black Americans to travel to Africa,"Ta-Nehisi Coates mused, in his 2015 book, Between the World and Me, about the nature of the relationship between black Americans and travel. тАЬIt had never occurred to me to leave America тАФ not even temporarily,тАЭ he says, elaborating that a friend of his тАЬonce said that he used to think of traveling as a pointless luxury, like blowing the rent check on a pink suit.тАЭ Black Americans still struggle to find access to the same avenues and institutions available to other Americans. We have been barred from homeownership, denied education, relegated to only certain professions. And when we do manage to gain access, we are frequently forced to submit to a disparate culture that reviles and polices our own. An unfortunate side effect of this is that we tend to internalize this notion that our contributions to the world are somehow less-than. After years of being told that your voice is unworthy, your hair unkempt, your speech unprofessional тАФ it becomes easier to believe the narrative that your gifts are worthless. For many, our dreams begin to follow this same path. Enter Birthright AFRICA, a nonprofit that seeks to break this cycle by giving young, black Americans a free birthright trip to Ghana. Founded on the principle of eventually тАЬproviding a free educational trip to Africa for every youth and young adult of African descent ages 13-30 in the United States,тАЭ it currently stands three years into its mission, and the results, so far, have been remarkable. Photo: Birthright AFRICA тАЬThis looks great. This isnтАЩt likeтАжa scam?тАЭ recalls Shanell Wrice-Naylor about first visiting the website in hopes of applying. тАЬBut no,тАЭ she continues, тАЬitтАЩs not. This is the real deal.тАЭ The real deal indeed тАФ and Wrice-Naylor would know: She participated in the program in 2019. Established in 2015, by co-founders Walla Elsheikh and Diallo Shabazz, Birthright AFRICA intends to create a community where young black Americans can тАЬdraw pride, confidence, and creativity from their cultural roots and legacy of innovation in the US and Africa.тАЭ тАЬThereтАЩs just a lack of culturally relevant curriculum in our K-12 systems that really allows students of African descent to explore who they are,тАЭ said Elsheikh in a recent interview, тАЬand that lack of exposure can really leave you feeling a sense of doubt; a lack of confidence in how you pursue your career and educational goals.тАЭ To address these concerns, Elsheikh has created Birthright AFRICA to be much more than just a simple vacation. Its program for Scholars is exceedingly comprehensive, and the results are swift. Wrice-Naylor, less than a year after her trip, has already taken those lessons to heart. She is actively planning a trip to Costa Rica to visit one of her fellow Scholars and has already secured a new job that more closely aligns with her personal goals and ethical responsibilities. тАЬIтАЩm an HR assistant for the JCCA,тАЭ she tells me. The JCCA is an organization that offers comprehensive care to children and families in New York. тАЬNow when I go to work, I know IтАЩm helping black and brown children find safe homes.тАЭ Photo: Birthright AFRICA/Facebook Long before any of the Scholars touch down in Ghana, there are weeks of meetings, excursions, and events that Elsheikh has dubbed the US Exploration Program. The entire breadth of the initiative spanned from May until August of last year for Wrice-Naylor. тАЬWe also went around to cultural sites in New York City, and we went to Howard University and spent a weekend [in Washington, DC,тАЭ she explains, тАЬwhere we went to the African American Museum of History and Culture.тАЭ The holistic agenda of the US Exploration Program not only serves as a forum for fellow Scholars to become acquainted with each other before their trip, but also as a way for them to liaise with pillars of black America. Guest speakers are invited to participate in the ScholarsтАЩ growth to help create a genuinely multidisciplinary opportunity. Some of these featured speakers had even been to Ghana before and were generous enough to share their personal experiences. тАЬIt really helped to solidify that sense of community,тАЭ Wrice-Naylor says of these engagements, тАЬat these networking events we would get to speak to black people from all different fields, they would talk about their experiences traveling and how their mindsets completely shifted and expanded, how it was life-changing for them. The way they described itтАжI was nearly in tears after every session.тАЭ Wrice-Naylor would soon board a plane at JFK to land in Ghana for her own revelatory experience, one to which Birthright AFRICA believes she is entitled. On the ground, in Ghana, their itinerary included many opportunities that the average traveler may not be privy to, all meticulously organized for Scholars in advance of their arrival. тАЬThey visit cultural sites and museums,тАЭ says founder, Elsheikh of the Ghanaian portion of the program, тАЬthey hear from leaders and entrepreneurs of African descent тАФ even visiting them in their workspaces. And they really get a sense of all that greatness: both historically and present day.тАЭ In 2019, scholars were also able to attend a speaking event heralded by storied Ghanaian statesperson and scholar, the Honorable Dr. Samia Nkrumah, daughter of the first president of independent Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. Once exiled from Ghana herself after a military coup in 1966, she had a particularly poignant note for the scholars, declaring: тАЬEvery one of us тАФ particularly the returnees, like myself тАФ the onus is on us individually to reconnect and learn about our families, to reconnect and learn about our African heritage.тАЭ Wrice-Naylor managed to secure a spot in the birthright program in a particularly auspicious year. The Ghanaian government proclaimed 2019 the Year of Return to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade, and to celebrate the incredible resiliency of the Africans forced to endure that unjustifiable torture. Photo: Michael Agbenyegah/Shutterstock тАЬWe went to Accra and Kumasi,тАЭ she tells me, тАЬand we went down to Cape Coast.тАЭ She pauses. Not for too long, but long enough that before she does, I already think I know what sheтАЩs going to say next. The beat is just long enough for her to have had a brief but visceral memory of what it was like to step inside those damp, lightless rooms in the belly of Cape Coast Castle. The same ones where as many as 1,500 Africans were imprisoned at a time, awaiting their journey across the middle passage only to arrive in the Americas enslaved. Like her, my ancestors endured the same fate, and we share this pause, for we both know that we are the dreams of those ancestors, personified. тАЬWe saw the slave dungeons,тАЭ she finishes, and I am overcome with the exact feeling that she had just recounted to me: Though I currently live in Africa, I have never been to Ghana nor set foot inside those dungeons myself, and I am overwhelmed, nearly to tears, at the retelling of a fellow black AmericanтАЩs return. тАЬOn her thirtieth birthday, she took a trip to Paris,тАЭ again, Ta-Nehisi Coates recalls to his then 15-year-old son of his wife, Kenyatta, тАЬI am not sure that you remember, you were only six.тАЭ Already a titan of journalism, a staff writer for The Atlantic, and with one book, The Beautiful Struggle, under his belt, Coates would be 37 years old before he applied for and received his very first United States passport. He credits his wife with the inspiration, noting that her energy when she returned home was infectious. That when she returned from Paris, тАЬher eyes were dancing with all the possibilities out there, not just for her, but for you and me.тАЭ Led by her example, Coates traveled to Paris himself. Before too long, he and Kenyatta had moved there together, their young son in tow, where Coates would finish the final edits on a letter he wrote to him, a novel-length one that would become a cultural phenomenon in the US and the world, the one that we call Between the World and Me. Coates cites among his heroes James Baldwin and Richard Wright тАФ men whose books he read growing up as a young man in Baltimore тАФ men who pursued their creative and professional pursuits abroad. Many cite cost as the principal factor in their ability to travel or not. But when you can see the luminaries that have benefitted from travel, and when those benefits have been proven to help people succeed by organizations like Birthright AFRICA, it seems irresponsible to continue to keep our travel goals an individual pursuit. Maybe we are learning that this struggle is one we should be tackling together, and though it may be arduous, perhaps united we can remove the stain of slavery. Maybe together we can and turn that struggle into a beautiful one. Though it partners with universities for a portion of it funding, Birthright AFRICA relies heavily on donations to provide this life-changing experience for its Scholars.

1099,44 African American graves found under Florida parking lot,"Courtesy: Fox 13 CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP/WSVN) тАФ A private archaeology firm says it has discovered what appear to be about 44 graves from a long-forgotten African American cemetery under a Florida parking lot. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the firm, Cardno, used ground-penetrating radar to find the suspected graves. The firm was hired by the city of Clearwater and the Pinellas County School Board to conduct the search. The school district owns the parking lot. Cardno also reported additional graves may exist under a nearby school district building. According to Fox 13, the graves were found underneath a former elementary school. The discovery is the third since August in which archaeologists have discovered lost African American graves in the Tampa Bay region. In the latest find, officials say the original cemetery was moved in 1954 but that some graves were left behind. Officials say Cardno will get permission to validate the radarтАЩs findings by digging just close enough to the graves to confirm their existence without touching them. Additional findings are expected by the end of March. After that, community meetings will be held to discuss what to do. Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

According to ESPN, Jennifer King has been hired for the coaching intern position on the Redskins. She becomes the second African American female coaching intern in the league, following Collette Smith who had an internship with the New York Jets during training, the outlet reported. King previously served as a wide receivers coaching intern with the Carolina Panthers, before taking up a position as an offensive assistant at Dartmouth College in 2019 when the Panthers parted ways with coach Ron Rivera. Rivera, now the head coach of the Redskins, called King a тАЬgreat additionтАЭ to the teamтАЩs staff. тАЬJennifer is a bright young coach and will be a great addition to our staff,тАЭ he said in a statement, according to ESPN. тАЬHer familiarity with my expectations as a coach and my firsthand knowledge of her work ethic and preparation were big factors in bringing her to the Redskins.тАЭ RELATED: 49ers Assistant Coach Katie Sowers On Being A Woman In Football: тАШItтАЩs Not Something That I Truly Think AboutтАЩ According to the outlet, Rivera and King met at the 2016 NFL WomenтАЩs Careers in Football Forum. тАЬPart of it, itтАЩs all about the fan base,тАЭ Rivera told ESPN in 2018 about envisioning a day where a woman becomes a head coach in the NFL. тАЬItтАЩs also knowing the moms out there that understand the game.

But equally as abhorrent are those who fake race and hate crime hoaxes either for sympathy, financial gain or to start a fight. That is what happened in the city of Philadelphia when a suspect allegedly wrote derogatory racial slur on the mural of Cecil B. Moore. The suspect, caught ion video, was also seen spray painting racial slurs at Brightside Academy and Habitat for Humanity, CBS Philly reported. The incident happened on February 15 and police showed a photo of the suspect on Wednesday. тАЬThe suspect is described as a black male, between 25 to 35 years of age, with a medium build. He was wearing a black jacket, gray sweatshirt, blue jeans, brown shoes and carrying a black duffel bag,тАЭ CBS Philly said.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was also a defense attorney and a politician in Philadelphia, making him a local hero to many of the areaтАЩs residents. It would have been horrific if any non black person spray painted racist comments on his mural, but it is mind numbing that the suspect is black. тАЬCecil Bassett Moore was a good man, why would they do that to him? Why would they do that to his picture itтАЩs crazy,тАЭ Lyric Lewis, 9, said when the graffiti was discovered, ABC 6 reported. тАЬHe was a very significant figure, not only in the African American lives but in the City of Philadelphia, and he was known nationally with his civil rights leadership,тАЭ City Council President Darrell Clarke said. тАЬWe need to send a signal, we canтАЩt have this in the City of Philadelphia.

1389,African American homeownership lowest since 1968,"At a time when housing prices continue to climb and affordability continues to dwindle, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) is eyeing ways to diminish the racial homeownership gap. тАЬIn 2020, there is still a persistent gap in homeownership rates between whites, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans,тАЭ Bryan Greene, NARтАЩs director of Fair Housing policy, said Thursday at the associationтАЩs second annual policy forum in Washington, D.C. тАЬWeтАЩve seen homeownership rates among racial groups steadily rise, but I think many of us would have expected rates to have risen more,тАЭ Greene added. тАЬWe did see that happen for a period from the early 90s to the early part of this century, but dramatically, at least for African Americans, we started to see that homeownership rate decline тАФ so much so that last year the homeownership rate for African Americans dipped below the rate in 1968 when the Fair Housing Act was passed.тАЭ The association recently announced sweeping changes to the way it approaches housing discrimination, which became all the more relevant after a groundbreaking report by Newsday that highlighted specific instances of discrimination by real estate agents, including some Realtors. The new proposal, passed unanimously by the associationsтАЩ eight-member leadership team, reviews state licensing laws, creates a voluntary fair-housing testing program and institutes new training programs. In the past year, NAR, along with the Urban Institute and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers тАФ a trade association that was established for African American agents at a time when they were still excluded from NAR тАФ held a roundtable focused specifically on boosting the homeownership rate for African Americans. According to the most recent Census information, homeownership among African American stood at 44 percent. The homeownership rate for white Americans, meanwhile, stands at 73.7 percent. тАЬThe fact that homeownership rates for African Americans have regressed in spite of the presence of fair housing laws makes clear that various institutional challenges still must be faced and defeated,тАЭ NAR President Vince Malta said in a statement. тАЬBy strengthening post-purchase counseling; funding programs to prevent foreclosure for low- and moderate-income and vulnerable families of color; and building tools that help create early-warning displacement triggers, we can ensure first-time homebuyers have the knowledge and resources to remain homeowners for the rest of their lives.тАЭ Email Patrick Kearns Simply enter the email address you used to create your account and click """"Reset Password"""".

Gray While Pete Buttigieg continues to be locked in a close contest battle for the top with Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucus, according to the most recent numbers, Democratic frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden is making time to let everyone know the former South Bend, Indiana mayor has barely any connection to Black voters. """"I'm saying he hasn't been able to unify the Black community тАФ that's what I'm saying,"""" Biden said in an interview Saturday with ABC News, noting that African American lawmakers in South Bend have endorsed him instead of Buttigieg. """"In order to win...you're going to have to be able to win states like Pennsylvania. You're gonna have to be able to win Florida. To have to be able to win a lot of places that, in fact, have very diverse populations. And so the assertion that he's ready across the board, I don't see it. I haven't seen it yet."""" Through his campaign, Buttigieg has struggled to get the backing of the African American community beginning with many questioning his mayoral administrationтАЩs handling of the fatal police shooting of a 54-year-old Black man last summer, which led to a meeting with local Black Lives Matter representatives who reported being dissatisfied with the result. That, paired with declining diversity in South BendтАЩs police force, left him with an uphill climb in the eyes of Black voters. """"I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan,"""" he admitted during a Miami Democratic debate last year. """"And when I look into his mother's eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back."""" Black staffers on ButtigiegтАЩs campaign have also been reportedly frustrated. The New York Times claims Black and Latinx staffers have said they have felt their concerns were not listened to, and that some felt they were only employed to help the campaign make certain diversity goals. Further, a January Washington Post/Ipsos poll shows Buttigieg with only 2 percent Black support, compared to BidenтАЩs 48 percent. Nonetheless, Biden has come in well behind Buttigieg and Sanders in the Iowa caucus with only about 15.8 percent of the total state delegates. Even still, he maintains that his support among Blacks will redeem his Iowa performance and his expected low performance in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. """"No one who has come in below second in Iowa and New Hampshire has ever won the nomination,"""" said ABC News тАЬThis WeekтАЭ host George Stephanopoulos. """"No one has ever won the nomination without being able to get overwhelming support from the African-American community either,"""" Biden responded """"So far, no one's doing that but me."""" .@GStephanopoulos: тАЬNo one has come in below second in Iowa and New Hampshire has ever won the nomination.тАЭJoe Biden: тАЬNo has ever won the nomination without being able to get overwhelming support from the African American community either."""" https://t.co/nPQ57Pvs7t pic.twitter.com/CavOkeFC6A BidenтАЩs identity with the African American community is largely powered by his association with former President Barack Obama, with whom he served for eight years. But Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is co-chair of BidenтАЩs campaign, told NPR that isnтАЩt the only reason why. тАЬI think it's his body of work and the fact that they see in him exactly what President Obama saw in him when he decided to canvass the entire Senate,тАЭ said Richmond, a recent chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. тАЬMany of [the] senators who are in the race now were there тАФ and he decided to offer the vice presidency to Joe Biden because of his body of work, from his involvement in the civil rights movement, the fact that he left a law firm to join the public defender's office, the fact that he is steady, and he is consistent.тАЭ As we head into the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, a number of the candidates will likely switch their focus to Black voters. The electorate in that state is two thirds Black and can ultimately determine how the Democratic candidates will fare with African Americans going forward. With that said, Biden doesnтАЩt necessarily have the state on lock. For example Columbia, S.C., lawyer and Richland city council chair Dalhi Myers, decided to support Sanders over Biden, saying she doesnтАЩt have the faith in his ability to win that others have. тАЬWhatтАЩs best for all of us is electrifying enough people ... who will go to the polls,тАЭ Myers, who is African American, told the Associated Press. тАЬI donтАЩt think honestly that Joe Biden can electrify the 400,000 African Americans in the state of South Carolina.тАЭ For his part, though, Buttigieg is apparently still trying to figure out his South Carolina game plan. According to Columbia newspaperThe State, Buttigieg has never held more than single digit polling numbers among Black voters, leaving him to play catch up to the other Democratic candidates. He says, though, itтАЩs a question of name recognition. тАЬI get that this is an ongoing process of earning trust, and I get that as a new guy I donтАЩt have decades worth of experience for folks around the country to get to know me, right?тАЭ he said in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, host of the syndicated radio show тАЬThe Breakfast Club,тАЭ according to The State.

1741,"Oxford celebrates 30 years of MLK Scholars, 50 years of African American graduates | Oxford College | Emory University","For some, 50 years may seem like a long time, and for others, 50 years is not nearly long enough. This year, Oxford College is celebrating 50 years of African American graduates and 30-plus years of MLK Scholars in a special 30-50 Celebration. тАЬIt could have been earlier, nevertheless itтАЩs still a milestone that we want to recognize,тАЭ says Oxford Chaplain Lyn Pace, who serves on the Oxford Celebrations Committee, a group formed to plan events and programs for the 30-50 Celebration. тАЬThis is an important marker, even though itтАЩs not necessarily a long period of time. ItтАЩs important to know our history and know our path moving forward as a college.тАЭ Campus Life Dean Joe Moon, who serves as a historian for the college, recently recognized that 1970 was the year that the first African American students graduated: Anthony Garfield Gibson, John Robert Hammonds, and Angela Yvonne Jinks. They first entered Oxford in 1968 under Dean Bond Fleming. тАЬWe have had four black students; their cooperation, their scholarship, and their leadership have been a blessing and an inspiration,тАЭ Fleming wrote in his annual report for 1969-1970. During their time at Oxford, the students were on academic merit lists, members and leaders in various council groups and, for Gibson and Hammonds, part of the Air Force ROTC. Jinks also was president of the Women's Advisory Council. The year to celebrate the graduates also is a good time to merge the celebration with recognizing more than 30 years of MLK Scholars, Pace says. Given annually, the Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship is a four-year, full tuition scholarship to Oxford College and Emory University. It is awarded to a student from Newton County based on financial need and merit through an application process. The student must maintain a 3.2 GPA to keep the scholarship. тАЬ[Attending Oxford] wasn't something that I thought about doing at first, but once I got here, I fell in love with it,тАЭ says Chris Ejike, this year's Oxford Scholar, who is a graduate of Newton High School and the Newton County College and Academy. тАЬI enjoy getting to know all of my classmates and working closely with my professors. I really like the community base.тАЭ Ejike, who plans to major in nursing, admits he was skeptical about living close to his hometown, but now he enjoys being able to go see his mom whenever he wants to. тАЬShe respects my privacy too,тАЭ he says. Events for the 30-50 Celebration kicked off on January 21 with the college's annual Martin Luther King Jr. celebration at historic Old Church. The speaker was alumna Sonya Tinsley-Hook 89Ox 91C, who was OxfordтАЩs first MLK scholar. Tinsley-Hook is the founder of the All Our Strengths project, which teaches people how to be тАЬstrengths championsтАЭ in their schools, communities, and organizations. Prior to the event in Old Church, a dinner in Phi Gamma Hall honored all the MLK Scholars and their families. The centerpiece of the 30-50 Celebration is BlackOUT Alumni Reunion Weekend, which will be held February 21 to 23. It will feature a special brunch, a performance from Oxford student group Voices of Praise Gospel Choir and alumni speaker Gerald Griggs 98Ox 00C. тАЬ[The committee] wanted to organize some events that would highlight black alumni over the years,тАЭ Pace notes about the decision to feature Oxford graduates from various decades at various 30-50 Celebration events. On display throughout the 30-50 Celebration is a special exhibit in the Oxford College Library, Framing Shadows, curated by Kimberly Wallace-Sanders, associate professor of American studies and African American studies in Emory University's Department of African American Studies. The exhibit is a prelude to her forthcoming book, Framing Shadows: African American Women and White Children in Domestic Portraiture. She also is author of the 2007 book Mammy: A Century of Race, Gender and Southern Memory. The exhibit in the Fran Elizer Exhibit Space features portraits of nannies, or тАЬmammies,тАЭ from 1840 to 1920 from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection, as well as texts and illustrations from EmoryтАЩs Rose Library's book and manuscript collections. Other 30-50 Celebration events include a Jericho Brown Reading in the student center at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 25, Black History Movie Night in the student center at 6:30 p.m. March 5, an oral history booth at April 18's Oxford College Alumni Weekend, and a campus-wide book drive, which Madison Redd, a second-year student from Houston, Texas, is organizing to help local elementary school students. Redd recently worked at Mainstay Academy, an alternative public school in Newton County near the college, to assist students with class and homework. She wants to present books to students at Mainstay as well as other Newton County schools. тАЬI hope to inspire a change in how we help our community and also encourage more students to read,тАЭ says Redd, who is currently studying educational studies, philosophy, and politics and law at Oxford. A few of these 30-50 Celebration events coincide with February's Black History Month events, some of which are annual. Some events are new, and are due in part to Anthony Mize, who has served as OxfordтАЩs director of diversity and inclusion since 2018. тАЬThere are a lot of great things going on at Oxford that focus not only on African American students but more minority groups,тАЭ Mize says, adding that diverse events help represent more of the Oxford community better and help all students prepare for a more global experience. тАЬIt's about diversity, inclusion, equality at Oxford, but also in the community and around the world.тАЭ In addition to the BlackOUT Alumni Reunion Weekend, Black History Month events at Oxford kicked off February 3 with a National Pan-Hellenic Council Showcase. The month also includes programs such as free HIV testing and a Men's Etiquette and Tie Relay Race.

2005,"In Milwaukee, A Rising Majority of New Coronavirus Cases Are African American Men","COVID-19, otherwise known as the coronavirus pandemic, has caused a new wave of problems for major U.S cities, with many barely keeping up with the rising number of cases growing by the day. In Milwaukee, many of these new cases are wreaking havoc in one group in devastating numbers: African American men. The City Health Commissioner Jeanette Kowalik announced on Monday that many of the new cases they were seeing for the coronavirus were in middle-aged African American men. While Kowalik did not confirm a specific percentage, she did say that out of the 158 cases they had that day, many of them were among black men. The first three Milwaukee patients reported to have died after contracting coronavirus were all African American men between the ages of 50 and 70. All of the patients had underlying conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems. Kowalik sees the rise stemming from the cityтАЩs long history of segregation and its effects on the local medical field, citing disparity that requires more outreach and education. тАЬLooking at the maps of Milwaukee, and looking where people live, looking at the history of redlining and segregation and how that crosses over into today,тАЭ she said to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, тАЬwhen weтАЩre talking about various health outcomes like infant mortality, childhood lead poisoning, you see very similar distributions.тАЭ The city is leading a campaign targeting African American men who may likely be at higher risk of contracting the virus. Kowalik also mentioned that the department will also be doing the same for the Latinx community as well where there has been another increase in cases. тАЬHealth officials are planning public service announcements focusing on the African American community, which will stress awareness about coronavirus, its symptoms, and who is most at risk for complicationsтАФas well as prevention measures, such as hygiene and social distancing.тАЭ !function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document,c=n.createElement('script');c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document); cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: '31d84b62-a3ea-4274-9349-1b7ccedbd1d7' }).render('3811c1c9bba941ecb6c4a456cf0ac0f7'); });  EVENTSWomen of Power SummitEntrepreneurs SummitBlack Men XCELWomen of Power TECH PODCASTSSistersInc.Your Money, Your Life LATEST LISTSBE 100sB.E.

2046,NYT├втВмтДвs 1619 Project tries to rob black Americans of their stake in 1776,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Opinion By Wilfred Reilly Submit March 4, 2020 | 8:28pm The New York TimesтАЩ 1619 Project argues that the United States is inextricably rooted in the evil of slavery, brought to these shores in 1619. As a black scholar, I reject this narrative. Instead of 1619, I take pride in our true Founding тАФ 1776. And IтАЩm not alone.  Some of 1619тАЩs attempts to link contemporary America to slavery are plain absurd. Matthew Desmond says US capitalism is uniquely brutal, and тАЬyou can trace that to the plantationтАЭ (no, you canтАЩt). Jeneen Interlandi argues that the one-syllable reason we donтАЩt have single-payer health care is тАЬrace.тАЭ Project leader Nikole Hannah-Jones argues that our wealth is due largely to slavery, a widely debunked claim. For good measure, there is even a 1619 essay headlined тАЬHow Segregation Caused Your Traffic Jam.тАЭ Numerous eminent historians, many of them of the left, have pointed out the manifest factual errors behind the projectтАЩs larger claims, in The Post and other ┬нvenues. The notion, for example, that preserving the Peculiar Institution was a major cause of the American Revolution is quite literally incredible. Yet Hannah-Jones and her colleague seem impervious to scholarly correction. That renders the potential political impact of 1619 all the more dangerous. If the prestige of the Times leads elites and ordinary Americans to accept its assertions as true, then the United States must be ┬нremade тАФ or else African Americans and others will remain justified in hating the country. If, for example, we donтАЩt have a single-payer system not because only 31 percent of Americans favor such a system, but because of the legacy of slavery, then establishing single-payer becomes an urgent moral imperative. The most hyper-competitive economy in the world is SingaporeтАЩs, which didnтАЩt have slavery. But if the competitiveness of ours owes to slavery, as the Times claims, then what choice do we have but to shift our entire economy in a social-democratic direction? In an era when leading presidential candidates propose just that, the implicit message of 1619 is clear тАФ and potent. I propose an alternative narrative. I am, along with Bob Woodson, Glenn Loury, Clarence Page, John Sibley Butler, Carol Swain, Coleman Hughes, ┬нTaleeb Starkes, John Wood and many others, a founding member of тАЬ1776,тАЭ an African-American-led pro-American organization launched partly to respond to the 1619 Project. Our project advances three core theses. First, many of the major claims of 1619, and of radical social science in general, are simply not true. That much the contributors to The PostтАЩs тАЬTwisted HistoryтАЭ series have already demonstrated. Second, we believe that slavery was radically evil, but also that it doesnтАЩt account for the uniqueness of America today; virtually every nation in the world had both slaves and slave-owners until the mid-19th century, and only one became the United States. Since the elimination of US slavery in 1865-66, our population has increased by 874 percent and our GDP by 11,796 percent, with both jumps driven by modern-era immigration. Third and most important, 1776 ┬нoffers an alternative, positive view of America. We believe that the United States is a flawed but very good society, where it is frankly not very hard to succeed with hard work and personal responsibility. People regularly immigrate to America from developing countries like Vietnam, Ethiopia and many others, and they outperform many native-born citizens. Rather than endlessly chastise America for the crimes of generations dead and gone, these sojourners look to the future. Rather than being hobbled by our nationтАЩs past, they draw inspiration from our timeless, world-leading ideals. Teaching those ideals anew to our own citizens is the best way for all of us to move forward, together.

2475,Biden in Mississippi: Credits the 'African American Community' for Comeback," Jump to content Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden addresses the crowd during a rally at Tougaloo College in Jackson, Mississippi on March 8, 2020. Photo by Seyma Bayram Themes of unity and overcoming hate penetrated the remarks of former Vice President Joe Biden and his supporters during the Democratic presidential hopeful's visit to Jackson yesterday. It was Biden's first trip to Mississippi since he announced his campaign for the presidency last April and timed just two days before Mississippians vote in the primary election. U.S. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., introduced Biden at New Hope Baptist Church on March 8 and at the historically black institution Tougaloo College later that day, referring to Biden as the """"come-back kid."""" Before winning the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29тАФwhich Thompson described as a """"decisive victory""""тАФBiden had seen low voter turnout in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada, losing those states to Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders. But Super Tuesday concretized Biden's popularity among the black electorate, particularly with older black voters. In Alabama, for example, Biden won 72% of the black vote, compared to just 9% for Sanders, The New York Times reported. Biden's appeal to black voters was on display in North Carolina and Virginia, too; he secured Virginia by more than 50 points. """"If I am the comeback kid, which I ain't there, yet, but if I'm the comeback kid, there's only one reason I've come backтАФthe African American community all around the country,"""" Biden said before an applauding black congregation inside of New Hope Baptist Church in northeast Jackson. Sanders, meanwhile, was in Michigan. On March 4, the Sanders campaign notified Mississippi press that the Vermont senator would visit Jackson on March 6, but cancelled his trip within 24 hours of announcing his Mississippi appearance. Commentators around the country suspected that the former Vermont senator had effectively conceded the state with the largest black populationтАФ38% of Mississippians are African AmericanтАФto Biden. Promise to Invest in HBCUs, Restore Voting Protections, Fight Racism At Tougaloo, Thompson lauded Biden for his ability to unite black and white Americans as well as the Democratic Party. In his remarks, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to black Americans. At Tougaloo, he repeated his promise to invest $70 billion in historically black colleges and universities, which lost nearly half their funding sources between 2003 and 2015, and pull in 70% less in endowments than their non-black public and private counterparts, causing many HBCUs to shutter their doors. Biden stressed the urgency of restoring Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which required federal oversight of states with track records of disenfranchising black voters. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder allowed that section to be gutted, thus paving the way for southern statesтАФincluding MississippiтАФto enact restrictive and discriminatory voter ID laws. Biden vowed to continue building on the work he had carried out as vice president to former President Barack Obama by supporting measures like expanding the Affordable Care Act. As president, he would """"reward work, not just wealth,"""" he said. """"I think we're in a position for a new awakening, I think we're at a second inflection point,"""" Biden had said earlier in the day at New Hope Baptist Church, referring to rising white-supremacist sentiments in America in the wake of the 2016 elections. """"I underestimated that hate is never defeated, it only hides,"""" Biden said, adding """"I never thought I'd see a day that y'all saw in 2017 in Charlottesville."""" He called out President Donald Trump's remarks in the aftermath of the violence, which resulted in the death of activist Heather Heyer after neo-nazi and white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. drove into a crowd of protesters. Trump responded to the violence then by pointing to """"very fine people on both sides"""" that day in Charlottesville. """"Presidents have to heal; presidents cannot hold grudges,"""" Biden added later at Tougaloo College. Though he vowed to beat Trump and his supporters, he insisted that """"we cannot become like them."""" Espy: 'We Need A Real Leader Who Can Unite Us, Heal Us and Excite Us' Before and during his visit to Mississippi, Biden had garnered endorsements from the Mississippi House Democrats, Congressman Thompson, former Secretary of Agriculture and Mississippi Congressman Mike Espy, United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1529, and others. """"We need a real leader who can unite us, heal us and excite us. Someone who not only can win the presidency but can also usher in down ballot victoriesтАФbecause we need to hold the House and flip the Senate,"""" Espy wrote in a statement emailed to the press on March 8. Journalists like Astead W. Herndon and Elie Mystal have commented on what Biden's success in South Carolina, Alabama and other southern states with large black populations. Writing in The Nation, Mystal pointed out that """"Biden's actual history and policy record also makes him a weird choice to be the leader among African American voters."""" He was the architect of the 1994 crime bill under former President Bill Clinton, and his treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, during which Biden sat as Senate Judiciary chairman, have also come under scrutiny in recent months. Ashton Pittman of the Jackson Free Press reported early in 2019 on Biden's track record of working with, and sometimes lauding, racist Dixiecrat politicians. Last fall, The Intercept reported that one of Biden's aides, Amit Jani, is a supporter of Nahendra Modi, the authoritarian and extreme right-wing prime minister of India. That country has been swept up in violent riots for the past few weeks after the announcement of a new citizenship law that would make it harder for Muslims to obtain citizenship. Anti-Muslim mobs have attacked and killed more than 38 people, many of them Muslim, while Indian law enforcement have done little to intervene. But Mystal brushed off allegations that South Carolina voters were ill-educated on Biden as a candidate, calling such arguments both offensive and short-sighted. Instead, he contextualized support for Biden by pointing out a crucial feature of his black voter base: their age. Most of Biden's black votes in South CarolinaтАФ75%тАФhad come from voters over the age of 60. These are people """"who have a living memory of oppression and violence,"""" Mystal wrote. """"Older black voters in South Carolina have a lifetime of education and experience dealing with the most persistent threat to their safety and rights in this country: white people,"""" Mystal added. """"Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States,"""" Mystal added, quoting Dr. Jason Johnson of The Root. In another article for the New York Times, Herndon quoted a 39-year-old black voter, Chris Richardson, who said: """"Black voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves. ... So yeah, we'll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media."""" While Sanders has gained the support of younger black votersтАФeven the Mayor of Jackson, Chokwe A. Lumumba, endorsed himтАФBiden continues to gain popularity among more pragmatic, older black voters. Healthcare for Mississippians, Overcoming Divisions Retired math teacher and football coach Nathaniel Davis, 91, remembers a time when he and his friends had to remember parts of the United States Constitution in order to vote. On the eve of the Mississippi primary election, the long-time Jackson resident reflected on how the past four years have shaped American life and politics, particularly in the South. тАЬThe confusion we have and the division haveтАФwe have all kinds of divisions in our government. We need somebody with a level head. We need somebody who we can talk to that doesnтАЩt have all the answers. And that makes quite a bit of difference. We donтАЩt need a dictator who will tell us everything to do,тАЭ Davis told the Jackson Free Press while waiting on an order at BullyтАЩs Soul Food Restaurant, a popular family-owned establishment in the Virden Addition neighborhood. Davis, who is voting for Biden, lived through the Jim Crow era and is concerned about the impact of TrumpтАЩs divisive and hurtful rhetoric today. тАЬThatтАЩs what I didnтАЩt like in the president and I think thatтАЩs what most of us didnтАЩt like,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhat he says is law. And it doesnтАЩt matter who heтАЩs hurting when he says it,тАЭ said Davis, who said he values leaders who can admit and apologize for their mistakes. Like some other Jackson-based Biden supporters also shared with the Jackson Free Press, BidenтАЩs experience in the White House and his promise to expand the Affordable Care Act appeals to Davis. тАЬ(Biden) knows the ropes of what is going on and I think we had a pretty good president in Obama. So why notтАФheтАЩs going to take up some of those things, especially healthcare. HeтАЩs not going to fight it like weтАЩve been fighting the healthcare. HeтАЩs going to try to find out different things that he can do with it, if itтАЩs broken and needs to be fixed, and I think heтАЩs one of those people who will go out and find somebody who will help to do that. IтАЩm not saying that the other guy (Sanders) wouldnтАЩt do that, it just so happens that I follow the trail of Biden and some of the things he has done as vice president,тАЭ Davis explained, adding that тАЬeither one of them I think would be a good thing for us.тАЭ Marvin Dale Jr. overheard DavisтАЩ remarks about Biden. Dale, 27, explained that BidenтАЩs criminal justice policy recordтАФincluding his endorsement of drug war policies in the 1980sтАФmakes it difficult for him and his peers to relate to Biden. He will vote for Sanders, whom he first heard speak in 2016 when Sanders came to DaleтАЩs alma mater, Tougaloo College. тАЬI think a lot of millennialsтАФblack millennialsтАФare uncomfortable with тАж the policies that (Biden) supported in the past,тАЭ Dale said. тАЬA lot of us want to imagine, (with) him working so close with Barack Obama, that he was able to probably learn more about black issues or identify more with black issues beyond what you see in present day and to understand that it is historical and to understand that it is a cycleтАФthat crime is a cycle and poverty is a cycle. But many of us arenтАЩt banking on that and are going with Bernie Sanders,тАЭ Dale said. Dale is particularly interested SandersтАЩ promise of student loan debt forgiveness and marijuana legalization at a time when criminalization of the drug contributes to the country and stateтАЩs high incarceration rates and education debt cripples young Americans. Such policies, Dale said, are tangible тАЬthings that would affect our lives right now, today,тАЭ which is why he believes his peers also support Sanders. The Jackson Free Press asked Dale if he had noticed a change in MississippiтАЩs racial dynamics in the wake of TrumpтАЩs election. тАЬIтАЩve definitely felt it change,тАЭ he responded. тАЬI think one overlooked superpower of being African AmericanтАж is that you can kind of feel the places you are unwanted. You (can) feel the hate. And since Donald Trump has been elected, I think that has kind of emboldened a lot of white supremacists,тАЭ explained Dale. He relayed anecdotes of friends experiencing racial slurs for the first time in their lives over the past four years as evidence of growing tensions between some white and black Mississippians. Desiree Reed, 27, works at Youth Villages as a primary services coordinator. Her dream is to open up a group home for young girls and women who are victims of sex trafficking and other abuses. For Reed, BidenтАЩs promise to deliver on healthcare access for Mississippians is why she is voting for him on March 10. тАЬI think a big issue for Mississippi is healthcare and I really feel like we really donтАЩt take it as seriously as we should,тАЭ Reed said. She described lack of mental health services and rising HIV/AIDS rates in the state as well as the pain of seeing her young clients and families unable to access critical medical services because they do not have health insurance. One young person Reed knows suffered an act of violence but is unable to afford surgery and mental health supports in the aftermath of the traumatic encounter, Reed said. тАЬI still feel there is nothing really set up to help us if we fall,тАЭ she said, emphasizing the need for тАЬsome type of foundationтАЭ to support Mississippians who continue to struggle without adequate healthcare. Greta Brown-Bully, co-owner of BullyтАЩs, emphasized the need for a more robust healthcare system in the state. Like Reed and Davis, she will vote for Biden. тАЬI like Sanders a lot. тАж ItтАЩs just that Biden already has that experience of being in the White House and working with president Obama, which makes that key factor a difference for me,тАЭ she told the Jackson Free Press on Monday. тАЬWe have wasted a lot of time last year with Trump. It was like a reality show. We never really got anything done. Maybe (Biden) can go back and help restore some of the things that President Obama had put in place, such as help people with healthcare, which is so important,тАЭ she said. тАЬI know weтАЩre in a Southern state, which is a Republican state,тАЭ Brown-Bully added. тАЬI pray that we are able to pull it off. I pray that our people get out and vote, and I hate that we are divided, because we are divided between Sanders and Biden. Very divided,тАЭ she said, before acknowledging that тАЬboth of them are great candidates.тАЭ Back at Tougaloo on Sunday, Thompson reiterated the importance of garnering support from southern black voters. тАЬThe path to the White House begins in the South,тАЭ he said. Mississippians will vote in the primary election on Tuesday, March 10. Polling locations will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. For more information, including a polling-site locator, see here: https://www.sos.ms.gov/pollingplace/pages/default.aspx.

2542,5 Richest African Americans In USA,"There are more than 600 billionaires in the United States. Out of this number, only five are Africa-Americans. While this figure probably proves the different opportunities afforded the whites and the blacks, this is still a pretty impressive feat. Here are five of the richest in USA in 2019: Jay-Z Jay-Z is now worth at least $1 billion. His massive fortune can be attributed to a successful music career and sound investments in tech companies, a talent management agency and the liquor industry.

Aside from his career earnings, he also made money appearing in movies such as """"Space Jam"""" and endorsement deals with Hanes and Gatorade, to name a few. MJтАЩs net worth is around $1.9 billion, per Business Insider. He is the current owner of NBA team Charlotte Hornets. 3. Oprah Winfrey Winfrey's fortune is many thanks to the longevity of """"The Oprah Winfrey Show"""" which spanned 25 years. It made her a household name and helped her build her own television network after. Her estimated net worth is at $2.7 billion. She also makes money from writing books and through appearance fees. The former TV host is the only female African American to eclipse the billion dollar mark fortune.

2769,"Louis ├втВм┼УLou├втВм┬Э Dale Sharp, the first African American state trooper - Sankofa Club","No products in the cart. Eight years after the Brooklyn Dodgers had hired Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play on a team in the Major Baseball League, Louis тАЬLouтАЭ Dale Sharp became the first African American state trooper. He graduated from OhioтАЩs 44th Academy class in 1955 and joined the team of Ohio State Highway troopers. That team of troopers, the Ohio State Highway Police (OSHP) included 700 faces. Only one of those had dark skin. That one man of color worked with the other members of the OSHP for 9 months, before resigning, in order to become a member of the general public and, one that gave back to the community. Louis Dale Sharp became an educator and a principal at several Catholic educational institutions within Ohio. His fellow citizens noted the effort that he put into tackling the challenge of directing teachers and teaching students. At one point, Sharp ran for and won a public office. He became Mayor of Urbancrest, OH. Historians have not offered any details, regarding the race of each person that served under the direction Sharp, when he was Mayor of Urbancrest. Still, one event offers a strong indication of the extent to which Sharp managed to invite into UrbancrestтАЩs City Hall a noteworthy number of other African Americans. That one event took place after the former Mayor had witnessed all the changes that took place between 1955 and the final years of the second decade in the 21st Century. He had helped to pave the way for some of those changes. For that reason, Louis Dale Sharp was inducted into the Ohio Civil Rights Hall of Fame. One change had been the introduction of Black History Month. During that Month, while schoolchildren were learning about famous men and women of color, one more name joined the list of those that had passed. That name was Louis Dale Sharp.

Early data from the US shows African Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19, highlighting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care, experts said. The new coronavirus isn't biased about who it infects - so why does data emerging from some states suggest that African Americans are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in the US? Experts say African Americans are disproportionately impacted by underlying health conditions linked to poverty, face discrimination in medical care and are more likely to work jobs that require them to leave their home. """"We know that black [people] are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease,"""" the nation's top doctor, Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CBS News on Tuesday.  These chronic illnesses, which are in turn linked to poverty and structural racism, can lead to more serious forms of the COVID-19 disease. Mr Adams, who is himself black and has high blood pressure and asthma, added: """"I represent that legacy of growing up poor and black in America. """"And I, and many black Americans, are at higher risk for COVID.""""  There is no nationwide data available on COVID-19 cases by race, but a pattern of over-representation by black Americans has emerged in states or jurisdictions that are sharing the numbers. Sixty-eight per cent of coronavirus deaths in Chicago have been among African Americans, who make up just 30 per cent of the city's population. """"Those numbers take your breath away,"""" the city's mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Monday at a coronavirus briefing. """"This is a call to action for all of us."""" The trend is repeated in North Carolina, Louisiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and the capital Washington.  Doctor Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the issue was also linked to social class, with black people more likely to work jobs deemed essential that expose them to potential infection. """"That population is more public-facing,"""" he said. """"More bus drivers, more people taking public transportation to work, more people providing services in nursing homes, more folks working in grocery stores.""""  The problem is compounded by implicit and explicit bias that African Americans face in the medical system. Doctor James Hildreth, president of the historically black Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee said that in his city, most of the initial testing took place at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Most of the patients who go to hospital systems like these have insurance, and it was only recently that three assessment centers were built for the underprivileged and minority communities - one of them run by Meharry. """"My point is, depending on which community you live in, and whether or not you have insurance... the chances for getting assessed are much less,"""" he said.  What's more, it's well documented that when black people seek care, they are less likely to have their symptoms believed or get adequately treated, Doctor Ebony Hilton, an anesthesiologist at the University of Virginia Medical Center said. For example, black women are less likely to have their breast cancer mammograms seen by a specialist as opposed to a general radiologist, according to a 2012 study from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Black heart patients who present with elevated levels of a group of proteins indicating cardiac injury are also less likely to be seen by specialists, per a 2018 study.  A civil rights group wrote this week to the US health secretary, Alex Azar, calling on him to """"release daily racial and ethnic demographic data related to COVID-19 testing, disease burden and patient outcomes."""" This, said the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was necessary to ensure a robust public health response, and to make certain care and testing aren't being administered in a discriminatory manner. The group said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was already collecting the information but deliberately withholding it. Ms Hilton stressed that it was in the interests of Americans as a whole to address the problem, because - unlike high rates of heart disease or cancer - a wave of coronavirus spreading through the black and Hispanic population will ultimately impact everyone else. """"When you have a system that's not treating these people of lower social-economic status and these minority groups, they are then not being tested, they're sent back home to infect their community,"""" she said. """"Those workers who are now infected are going to the grocery store, and when the upper echelon of America are going to get their food, they will get infected too."""" People in Australia must stay at least 1.5 metres away from others and gatherings are limited to two people unless you are with your family or household.

3039,Why are black Americans disproportionately affected by COVID-19?,"Experts explain why the disparity exists in Minnesota communities. (FOX 9) - Health professionals are very worried about the access to care for people of color as well as how they are treated by health care workers as COVID-19 cases increase in Minnesota. In Minnesota, the situation is slightly better than other states but still far from equal. """"Injustice in the health care is the most shocking and inhumane and we didnтАЩt take heed to that warning,"""" said NAACP President Leslie Redmond. """"And thatтАЩs exactly what we are seeing right now, why the African American community is being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 is because of institutionalized racism.тАЭ Redmond is worried about how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting her community. In other major cities across the country, African Americans are dying at an alarming rate from COVID-19. In Minnesota, the picture is slightly better. Recent data shows whites are about 84 percent of the population, 73 percent of the coronavirus cases, and 88 percent of the deaths. Minorities are a disproportionate number of cases, however, the death rates are not as high. """"ItтАЩs during pandemics, like this, these really get highlighted in very real, sobering ways,"""" said Dr. Mark Steffen. """"And itтАЩs disappointing to say the least.тАЭ Dr. Steffen is the chief medical officer at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota. They have at least 300 clinicians working with people in underserved communities in the area. Lack of access to health care, unfair treatment by health care workers, and underlying health conditions are some of the major reasons behind the disparities. """"WeтАЩve really set up a system that revolves around the traditional populations that have existed within our state, within the nation and that demographic has shifted rapidly and our health care system needs to change and shift rapidly with that,"""" said Dr. Steffen. African Americans and other minority groups are also less likely to be able to work from home and rely on public transit. Community leaders say they need better resources to adapt to our changing society.

3085,Pastors call on President Trump to address disproportionately high coronavirus deaths among African Americans,"Bishop William J. Barber, II North Carolina speaks during a Zoom video conference Wednesday afternoon with other pastors across the country.Zoom CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A group of black ministers is pleading with the Trump Administration to offer more information about the coronavirus death rates in communities of color where -- in many cities -- a disproportionate amount of African Americans are dying at alarming rates. Rev. William Barber II of the Poor People's Campaign has served as one of the loudest voices in black communities demanding more attention in neighborhoods and regions without equitable access to health care, remote learning, food and coronavirus testing. Like major cities around the country, Cleveland, where about 49.6 percent of the population is black, has not been immune to the amount of African American deaths as a result of COVID-19. Issues like transportation, access to primary-care doctors, housing, lack of sick leave and others make some people more susceptible to the potentially fatal virus, said Dr. Heidi Gullett, Cuyahoga County Board of HealthтАЩs medical director. As of Wednesday, of OhioтАЩs 7,119 cases in which race is known, 64.2% are white, 24.3% black and the rest are other races or multi-race. OhioтАЩs population is 81.9% white and 13% black, according to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Rev. Eddie Anderson of Los Angeles sees African Americans being affected by the virus. """"We have limited testing for coronavirus, but no place to get care except one hospital,"""" Anderson said. """"The coronavirus may get us sick, but America's racism is what's killing us today."""" Rev. Dr. Cynthia L. Hale, the senior pastor at Ray of Hope Christian Church in Atlanta, is """"advocating for black and brown people"""" who have disproportionately been infected and died from the virus. She noted that many African Americans in the Atlanta area are in the frontline fighting as healthcare workers. """"Not only are they jeopardizing their own safety, but the safety of those they return home to,"""" she said. """"Given the fact they are giving so great of a sacrifice, it is appalling that these men and women have to struggle with a shortage of healthcare equipment needed to save lives such as ventilators."""" Bishop Yvette Flunder of City of Refuge United Church of Christ in Oakland California shared a similar sentiment. She serves a population of 70 percent African American and said the area she serves fears an explosion of COVID-19. For some of the community around her, there is """"no shelter in place when there is no shelter."""" """"As homelessness is often created as urban populations are experiencing huge rent increases while median income has declined,"""" she said. """"...it (coronavirus pandemic) reminds me of medieval Europe during the plagues. I have seen the proliferation in Oakland, and our seniors and our homeless and our housing-insecure people are in grave danger. There is no sheltering in place where there is no shelter and the most vulnerable are the people who are housing insecure. Something must be done."""" Pastors from Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans and other cities participated in the Zoom call Wednesday afternoon to address the problem that is the high rate of death when it comes to African Americans in the coronavirus pandemic. Barber, who is also president and senior lecturer of Repairers of the Breach and pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in North Carolina, demanded that the Trump Administration use the Defense Production Act to mobilize manufacturers to make personal protective equipment without price gouging sectors who are on the frontline. He also demanded that there be more test sites and field hospitals built in areas with more black and poor people, and to ask the states that have not expanded Medicaid to do so. States should also provide immediate eligibility for Medicaid for anyone out of work as a result of the pandemic. The pastors also asks that the Trump administration unleash a recovery bill that focuses on poor and minority communities to ensure people make livable wages and have access to paid sick leave, adequate child care, rent forgiveness and healthcare. Finally, they ask that the administration release better coronavirus data related to its impact on minority neighborhoods and communities. Repairers of Breach, a not-for-profit organization based in North Carolina that builds a moral agenda and movement for all, hosted the discussion. Pastors also told stories of things they have seen themselves while serving in their respective communities. The full video conference is available here. """"Blacks often live in communities with less access to high-quality, affordable healthcare,"""" Barber said. """"This limits testing and treatment, which results in more severe cases and deaths. This is why we must guarantee health and living wages as a right, not a privilege, especially in states that have refused to expand Medicaid."""" Mississippi, for example, has a death rate reported to be 70% among blacks, Barber said. Those who participated in the conference included Barber, minister of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina; the Rev. Traci Blackmon, executive minister of justice and witness ministries of The United Church of Christ and senior pastor of Christ The King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Missouri; and the Rev. Dr. Leslie Callahan, the first female pastor of the 119-year-old St. Paul's Baptist Church in Philadelphia. The pastors stressed that systemic racism plays an outsized role in the public health of communities of color. """"We live in a country where skin color is hazardous to one's health, and mortality is not determined by one's genetic code, but instead by one's zip code,"""" Rev. Dr. Frederick D. Haynes, of Dallas said. A study by the National Academy of Medicine has shown that African Americans have less access to healthcare and lower quality of healthcare than white people all across the county.

3109,"Most COVID-19 deaths in La. are among African Americans, data shows","BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - According to the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH), slightly more than 70% of COVID-19 related deaths in the state are among African Americans, most of them with underlying health issues. LDH reports than more than 60% of patients who died had hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, followed by diabetes. тАЬPandemics have a way of really bringing out whatтАЩs already been there, so weтАЩve known that disparities in the healthcare existed in Louisiana especially among African Americans,тАЭ said Dr. Rani Whitfield.

The patients who walked into Dr. Uch├й BlackstockтАЩs urgent-care clinics in Brooklyn, N.Y., with coughs and fevers were white, black and brown. But in the last few weeks, she has witnessed a notable shift: Fewer white people have showed up, while there has been a dramatic uptick in the number of black and brown patients. Many are lower-income service workers and essential workers тАФ delivery drivers, police officers, subway workers, corrections officers тАФ who do not have the luxury of working from home or retreating to a second home in a less dense community. тАЬPeople say that COVID-19 is a great equalizer and that everyoneтАЩs going to be impacted,тАЭ said Blackstock, chief executive of Advancing Health Equity. тАЬBut the fact is that certain communities are more harshly impacted than others.тАЭ The available data of the race of coronavirus victims тАФ released by only a handful of states тАФ bear out that observation, revealing a stark disparity between white and black residents. In Michigan, black people have died at more than eight times the rate of white people. In Illinois, they have died at nearly six times the rate. In Louisiana, the difference is fivefold. Public health experts said those figures reflected deep-rooted social and economic inequalities. Not only are black Americans less likely to be insured and able to afford testing, but they are more likely to have underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease that could put them at higher risk for severe illness. They are 60% more likely than white Americans to be diagnosed with diabetes and 40% more likely to have high blood pressure, according to the U.S. government. тАЬThis virus is treading a glide path that unfortunately our society has paved through structural racism and poverty,тАЭ said Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a former director of the Detroit Health Department. тАЬIt is finding its way into our most vulnerable communities, who in our country tend to be disproportionately black and brown.тАЭ The problem is compounded by the fact that many of the most vulnerable people work in service jobs that increase their risk of being exposed to the virus. Fewer than 20% of black workers are able to work from home compared with about one-third of their white counterparts, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last week, Jason Hargrove, a 50-year-old bus driver from Detroit, died from complications of COVID-19 just 11 days after he posted a video railing against a woman on his bus who had just coughed four or five times without covering her mouth. тАЬWeтАЩre out here as public workers, doing our job, trying to make an honest living to take care of our families,тАЭ he said on the video. тАЬBut for you to get on the bus, and stand on the bus, and cough several times without covering up your mouth, and you know that weтАЩre in the middle of a pandemic, that lets me know that some folks donтАЩt care.тАЭ On Monday, the LawyersтАЩ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and hundreds of doctors called on the federal government to begin reporting the racial and ethnic demographic data on COVID-19 immediately. тАЬSystemic racism and bias in the health care system have resulted in chronically poor health outcomes for black Americans,тАЭ Kristen Clarke, the president of the committee, wrote in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. тАЬThese co-morbidities render black Americans more susceptible to severe respiratory complications and death resulting from COVID-19.тАЭ Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, listens during a briefing about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Wednesday, April 1, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)AP The nationтАЩs top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said at a White House briefing Tuesday that health disparities had always existed for the African American community, but the pandemic was тАЬshining a bright light on how unacceptable that is.тАЭ тАЬItтАЩs not that theyтАЩre getting infected more often,тАЭ he said. тАЬItтАЩs that when they do get infected, their underlying medical conditions тАж wind them up in the ICU and ultimately give them a higher death rate.тАЭ Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said the administration would soon release more demographic data. Such racial data are needed to improve access to testing and treatment, according to public health experts. тАЬWe need to know which communities are going to need more resources so that we can allocate them equitably and mitigate the potential devastation,тАЭ Blackstock said. тАЬWhat communities are going to need more health care workers? WhoтАЩs going to need more personal protective equipment? WhoтАЩs going to need more ventilators ? WhoтАЩs going to need more trained personnel who can work in an ICU setting?тАЭ In New York, the discrepancy between rich white and poor black neighborhoods is so stark that Blackstock has closed a clinic in the relatively white, affluent area of Brooklyn Heights so that she can shift staff to clinics dealing with the surge of infected black and brown patients in Prospect Park South and Crown Heights. тАЬAlready before the COVID-19 pandemic, these communities were in crisis,тАЭ she said. тАЬAnd now we have a crisis within a crisis.тАЭ In Chicago, where black people constitute 30% of the cityтАЩs population but 68% of COVID-19 deaths, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Monday that officials would mount an aggressive public health campaign targeting minority communities. тАЬWe canтАЩt simply stand by and let this disease wreak havoc in our communities,тАЭ she said. тАЬLives are truly at stake.тАЭ In Louisiana, Dr. Joseph Kanter, assistant state health officer and medical director for the New Orleans region, said the disproportionate number of African Americans who had been infected and died with COVID-19 was тАЬconcerning and disheartening,тАЭ but тАЬnot entirely surprising given the degree of health disparities and inequity we know exist in Louisiana.тАЭ Dr. Joshua Denson, an intensivist at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, said he had seen many African American patients with COVID-19 in recent weeks, many with preexisting conditions that made them vulnerable, such as obesity and diabetes. тАЬOur first cases were occupations that had a lot of exposure,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhether Uber driver or bus drivers, service workers, teachers. тАЬWe have to look into the data and see what could potentially explain this,тАЭ he added. тАЬNew Orleans is a city thatтАЩs known to have a lot of health disparities.тАЭ Some black residents say that the problems are further exacerbated by members of the community who resist calls to social distance and refuse to wear masks. In Baton RougeтАЩs Uptown neighborhood, James Harris, a 63-year-old mechanic, has been quaranting at home тАФ wearing a mask when he goes out to Walmart and not giving friends rides in his car. But even after a neighbor died on March 24, he said, many of his neighbors were not taking precautions. тАЬTheyтАЩre not worried about the virus,тАЭ he said.

3379,"African Americans account for most positive COVID-19 tests at Cincinnati health clinics, commissioner says","Menu EditorтАЩs note: With our coronavirus coverage, our goal is not to alarm you but to equip you with the information you need. We will try to keep things in context and focus on helping you make decisions. See a list of resources and frequently asked questions at the end of this story. CINCINNATI - African Americans account for a majority of positive COVID-19 tests at the City of Cincinnati's health clinics, Health Commissioner Melba Moore announced Monday. Moore said the racial breakdown of 59 positive tests shows: Moore also said African Americans and Caucasians have the same number of positive tests, 52, across all of Cincinnati. Moore made those announcements during Mayor John Cranley's COVID-19 briefing. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Cincinnati was 50.3% white and 42.7% black as of July 2019. Moore did not comment on the numbers she presented. WATCH Monday's briefing in the video player above. Moore started providing racial breakdowns last week after WCPO 9 News requested that information from local governments. At the time, she announced that the city's three COVID-19 deaths included two African Americans and one Caucasian. RELATED: Is COVID-19 hitting African Americans disproportionately harder than whites? Moore reported one more COVID-19 death over the weekend but did not disclose the victim's race. The city has 12 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, raising the total to 164, Moore said. Thirteen more people have recovered, raising that total to 56. SEE the city's COVID-19 report.

According to the World Health Organization, coronaviruses are """"a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus, such as COVID-19, is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and has now been detected in 37 locations across the globe, including in the U.S., according to the CDC. The CDC reports the initial patients in China have some link to a large seafood and live animal market, indicative of animal-to-person spread. A growing number of patients, however, did not report exposure to animal markets, indicating the disease is spreading person-to-person. What are the symptoms? How does it spread? Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death, according to the CDC. Symptoms can include fever, cough, shortness of breath. The CDC said symptoms could appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. It is similar to the incubation period for MERS. Spread of the virus is thought to be mainly from person-to-person. Spread is between people who are in close contact with one another (within about six feet). Spread occurs via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. According to the CDC, it could be possible for a person to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, the CDC said. The disease is most contagious when people are the sickest and showing the most symptoms. Coronavirus",0,0,0,0

3471,Black American Business Owners Sound Off in New Survey of PPP,"Financing from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is getting a cool reception from black business owners. A new national survey of 50 small businesses conducted Thursday by Washington, D.C.-based Creative Investment Research on the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance (EIDL) Program was intended to get a true pulse of how effective the lending programs have been. The survey came out the same day the House ratified a bill by the Senate to pump roughly $310 billion more in loans to the Paycheck Protection Program, The Wall Street Journal reports. The PPP exhausted its initial $350 billion funding last week after being rolled out on April 3. The program for firms with up to 500 workers became law in late March as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package. It was geared to help small companies cover payroll and other key operating costs. Loans can be forgiven if businesses retain the size of their workforce. Some $60 billion of the new funding will go to small and medium-sized community lenders, addressing concerns of some black small businesses and churches about landing funding. About $60 billion will be directed to the EIDL Program, which also has drained its initial funding. William Michael Cunningham, an economist and banking expert who runs Creative Investment Research, said the survey was conducted after reports of large businesses receiving funding intended for small businesses that have been closed or otherwise affected by the coronavirus pandemic. He says the analysis is the first of its type with 91% of survey respondents being black Americans. The report revealed that out of the 60% of survey respondents who applied for the PPP program, 33% got some level of funding. Yet, Cunningham noted one respondent commented that he тАЬreceived 1/12th of the amount I asked for.тАЭ When it comes to the EIDL Program, of the 72% of the survey respondents who applied, 28% got some level of funding. His firm is continuing to conduct the survey, so the results may change as new survey responses arrive. All told, Cunningham says the performance of both programs is better than popular opinion would lead us to expect. He added part of the reason for the higher than expected participation in the two programs may be due to a self-selection bias; most of the people who responded did so after his firm posted the survey link during a webinar on the PPP and EIDL Programs sponsored by the NAACP. тАЬWhat was surprising was the number of firms that applied and got some funding, even though it was not as much as they needed or wanted,тАЭ Cunningham says. Most of the survey respondents were located in Baltimore, Maryland; Nashville, Tennessee; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Washington, D.C. Other cities included ranged from Philadelphia to Indianapolis to Denver to San Jose, California to Tampa, Florida. Some 83% of respondents had one to six employees. In terms of representative industries, most respondents were in healthcare (12.5%), followed by construction and consulting, both 8.3%. Churches represented 4.2% of respondents. Cunningham shared comments from the survey that included: Looking ahead, Cunningham contends information in this survey is significant with respect to the new round of PPP funding because, used correctly, it can help make the PPP better. He added it can help make sure that PPP resources reach black-owned businesses. He suggested that civil rights organizations conduct their own surveys. !function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document;c=n.createElement('script'),c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document); cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: '7a99bbff-ee60-489a-b377-212102e8a9a1' }).render('36f26b9bfc7c4b75b62dd096b3ffa5ae'); });  EVENTSWomen of Power SummitEntrepreneurs SummitBlack Men XCELWomen of Power TECH PODCASTSSistersInc.Your Money, Your Life LATEST LISTSBE 100sB.E.

3605,Black Americans Have a Message for Democrats: Not Being Trump Is Not Enough,"Advertisement Supported by Joe Biden wants to heal the soul of the country in this moment of protest and loss, and win the White House. Simply telling people to vote in November may not help with either goal. By Astead W. Herndon COLUMBIA, S.C. тАФ In an on-camera address after a week of destructive protests, former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. pleaded with his audience to imagine life for black people in America. Imagine, he said, тАЬif every time your husband or son, wife or daughter left the house, you feared for their safety.тАЭ Imagine the police called on you for sitting in Starbucks. тАЬThe anger and frustration and the exhaustion, itтАЩs undeniable,тАЭ he said. Exhaustion. For many black Americans across the country, what a year this month has been. The coronavirus pandemic has continued to disproportionately kill black people, and a spate of high profile killings in recent months in Georgia, Kentucky, and Minnesota, the latter two at the hands of the police, led to widespread demonstrations nationwide. Protests shook more than three dozen cities on Saturday as crowds expressed outrage over the death of George Floyd, a black security guard who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. Demonstrators shut down freeways, set fires and battled police batons and tear gas, the pain and frustration of the moment spilling out into the streets. In Columbia, the city where Mr. Biden delivered his victory speech after the South Carolina primary just over three months ago, demonstrators on Saturday said they were demanding more than what it seemed like an election in November would deliver. Not only justice for the death of George Floyd, but change in political and economic power that would prevent the death of another black person in police custody, another brutal video going viral. тАЬIтАЩm tired of coming out here,тАЭ said Devean Moon, a 21-year-old Columbia resident, one of hundreds who participated in the peaceful protests in the city. тАЬIтАЩm tired of feeling forced to do all this.тАЭ It dawned on Sierra Moore, 24, who attended the protests carrying a homemade sign that read тАЬNo Justice, No Peace,тАЭ that she and her grandmother have been protesting the same issues over the course of a century. She looked at the racially diverse group of thousands, which gathered for a short program on the State House steps before leading a march to the local police station. Next to her was another sign: тАЬRespect my existence or expect my resistance.тАЭ тАЬI just donтАЩt think thatтАЩs how change happens,тАЭ Ms. Moore said of voting. тАЬTheyтАЩve been telling us to do that for so long тАФ and weтАЩve done it тАФ and look at everything thatтАЩs still going on.тАЭ Her words тАФ expressing a sentiment shared by her peers тАФ serve notice to politicians, civil rights groups and Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee who has urged unity amid the frustration. тАЬIf you want change in America, go and register to vote,тАЭ said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, but interviews with activists and leading Democratic figures including Stacey Abrams of Georgia, the longtime civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, and Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, flipped that typical framework: If Democrats want people to vote, party leaders need to listen to why people are angry. Ms. Abrams described the events of the past week as what happens when people are desperate for тАЬtheir pain to be validated.тАЭ тАЬYou cannot motivate someone to a behavior that they donтАЩt believe will actually bring change,тАЭ she said. тАЬWe have to start by saying what you feel and what you fear is real.тАЭ As he seeks to win the White House for the Democrats, the party that is the political home of most black Americans, Mr. Biden has attempted to strike this balance. He made clear that he has spoken to Mr. FloydтАЩs family. тАЬWe are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us,тАЭ he said in a statement released early Sunday morning. тАЬWe are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.тАЭ тАЬThe very soul of America is at stake,тАЭ he said, tying the tension between the police and black communities to removing President Trump from the White House. The moment may still test Mr. BidenтАЩs priorities, as a weary black electorate desires far greater change than the promise of a return to normalcy that has fueled his campaign. Energizing those voters, activists and elected leaders say, means addressing their demands for change and the realities of racism. But the former vice president, one of the Senate architects of the modern criminal justice system, cannot confront racism without addressing systemic inequalities, and he cannot address systemic inequalities by simply returning to a pre-Trump America. тАЬOur needs arenтАЩt moderate,тАЭ Mr. Jackson said in a recent interview. тАЬThe absence of Trump is not enough.тАЭ Mr. BidenтАЩs win in South Carolina was a turning point for his once-flailing campaign. His support came from across all demographics, but his particular strength was older black voters тАФ people who said the communityтАЩs familiarity with and trust of Mr. Biden, combined with his perceived ability to beat Mr. Trump, earned their backing. To win in November, and to deliver on his promise of American unity, Mr. Biden is likely to need more than the coalition that brought him his primary victory. And to engage younger voters, heтАЩll need to offer more than the promise of ousting Mr. Trump as an answer to current despair. On the policy front, a task force with criminal justice experts that supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has already been convened. Mr. Biden recently released a тАЬPlan for Black America,тАЭ covering economic inequality and voting rights. Mr. Jackson, who supported Mr. Sanders in the primary, said Mr. Biden is тАЬa consensus builderтАЭ and, if surrounded by the right people, the quality should serve him well. But Mr. Biden also must minimize mistakes, said Mayor Stephen Benjamin of Columbia, alluding to the recent controversy in which Mr. Biden apologized after saying тАЬyou ainтАЩt blackтАЭ to black people uncertain whether to support him or Mr. Trump. тАЬThe greatest asset that every candidate has, for better or for worse, is authenticity,тАЭ Mr. Benjamin said. He views authenticity as a prerequisite to leveling with people who are used to being disappointed. тАЬI do believe, that if the vice president is authentically Joe, a legitimately good man who cares, I think people will gravitate to that authenticity.тАЭ Engaging with a community that feels disaffected by the political system can be difficult. Mr. Trump has made a public show of trying to coax black Americans away from the Democratic Party, though he inadvertently made clear in comments to reporters on Saturday how little progress he has made: тАЬMAGA is Make America Great Again,тАЭ he said, discussing his voting base. тАЬBy the way, they love African-American people, they love black people. MAGA loves the black people.тАЭ Last October, Mr. Trump was in Columbia to address a forum on policing and criminal justice тАФ many of the issues protesters are taking to the streets over тАФ held at Benedict College, a historically black institution. He spoke a day ahead of some of the 2020 Democratic candidates, including Mr. Biden. тАЬThe Democratic policies have let African-Americans down and taken them for granted,тАЭ Mr. Trump said then. Progressive black leaders are extremely critical of Mr. Trump, as are many black voters. But they also believe that Democrats have sometimes been their greatest obstacle in addressing police brutality and racial inequality. тАЬPart of the reason these are systemic inequalities is that they transcend not only party, but time,тАЭ said Ms. Abrams, who is among those being vetted by Mr. Biden as a potential running mate. She also noted that:тАЬWe have to be very intentional about saying this is not about one moment or one murder тАФ but the entire infrastructure of justice.тАЭ Ms. Pressley, one of the House members who introduced a resolution to condemn police brutality, racial profiling, and the excessive use of force in Congress this past week, pointed to the confluence of issues facing black communities: a public health crisis, an economic crisis and, with the threat of police violence, тАЬjust trying to stay alive.тАЭ Economic experts have predicted that even as the country faces a nationwide downturn, black communities may be hit particularly hard. Access to capital will dry up more quickly, especially for black business owners, and a coming тАЬavalanche of evictionsтАЭ could displace black renters across the country. Ms. Pressley, an insurgent progressive in 2018 who beat a Democratic incumbent partly with a strategy to engage nontypical voters, said if elected officials want to speak to peopleтАЩs pain, they have to understand the тАЬdeficit of trustтАЭ theyтАЩre operating under. тАЬPeople donтАЩt participate, not because theyтАЩre ignorant and they donтАЩt know enough,тАЭ she said. тАЬItтАЩs because they know too much. They live it every day.тАЭ At SaturdayтАЩs march in South CarolinaтАЩs capital, thousands gathered at a state capitol rich with its own racial back story. The Old Carolina State House was burned to the ground during the Civil War, and the new building includes monuments to 19th-century state figures who were open racists тАФ such as Dr. J. Marion Sims, a pioneer in the field of surgery who experimented on enslaved black women, and Benjamin Tillman, a former U.S. senator and South Carolina governor who spoke positively about lynch mobs that killed black residents. On Saturday, the state house steps were filled with many black South Carolinians, demanding the right to live without fear, an echo of what some people fought for more than a century ago, in the days of Mr. Sims and Mr. Tillman. тАЬClearly our voices are not enough,тАЭ said Kayla Brabham, a 28-year-old student at Benedict College who skipped Mr. TrumpтАЩs speech at her school. тАЬItтАЩs not just the last couple years or months, itтАЩs the whole time IтАЩve been alive,тАЭ she said. тАЬWe should not have to come out here to make yтАЩall feel like weтАЩre important.тАЭ Even her name, she said, was a reminder of the countryтАЩs legacy of black violence. тАЬB-R-A-B-H-A-M, тАЭ she said, spelling it out. тАЬWe got that from our slave masters. My great-great-grandmother was a slave in Hampton, South Carolina.тАЭ Advertisement",0,0,1,3
3631,Biden: I was too ├втВм╦Ьcavalier├втВмтДв about suggesting African Americans Trump supporters as 'ain't black',"ATLANTA (AP) тАФ Joe Biden said he тАЬshould not have been so cavalierтАЭ in comments he made early Friday in which he suggested African Americans who back President Trump тАЬainтАЩt black.тАЭ Biden addressed the controversy during a conference call with the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce Friday afternoon. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee appeared on the тАЬBreakfast Club,тАЭ a radio program that is widely regarded in the black community. The host, Charlamagne Tha God, pressed Biden on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be vice president and told him black voters тАЬsaved your political life in the primariesтАЭ and тАЬhave things they want from you.тАЭ """"I'm not acknowledging anybody who is being considered,"""" Biden said. """"But I guarantee you there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple."""" A Biden aide then sought to end the interview, prompting the host to say, """"You can't do that to black media."""" Biden responded, """"I do that to black media and white media"""" and said his wife needed to use the television studio. He then added: """"If you've got a problem figuring out whether you're for me or for Trump, then you ain't black."""" The comments come at a critical point in the presidential campaign as Biden tries to revive the multi-racial and multi-generational coalition that twice elected Barack Obama. He has already committed to picking a woman as his running mate and is considering several African American contenders who could energize black voters. But with black voters already overwhelmingly opposed to Trump, Biden is also considering candidates such as Klobuchar. Trump and his allies, on defense for weeks over the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, were eager to seize on Biden's comments. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Trump supporter and the Senate's sole black Republican, said he was """"shocked and surprised"""" by Biden's remark. """"I thought to myself, as an African American, been black for 54 years, I was struck by the condescension and the arrogance in his comments,"""" Scott said in a conference call quickly arranged by the Trump campaign. """"I could not believe my ears that he would stoop so low to tell folks what they should do, how they should think, and what it means to be black."""" Symone Sanders, a Biden senior adviser who is also black, said his comment in FridayтАЩs interview was тАЬmade in jest."""" тАЭLetтАЩs be clear about what the VP was saying,"""" Sanders tweeted. тАЬHe was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against TrumpтАЩs any day. Period.тАЭ Black voters helped resurrect BidenтАЩs campaign in this yearтАЩs primaries with a second place finish in the Nevada caucuses and a resounding win in the South Carolina primary after heтАЩd started with embarrassing finishes in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire. Sixty-one percent of black voters supported Biden during the primary, according to AP VoteCast surveys across 17 states that voted in February and March. There is little chance of a sudden shift in support for Trump among black voters. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, compared with 84% who view him unfavorably. Seventy-five percent of African American registered voters say they have a favorable view of Joe Biden; 21% hold an unfavorable opinion. There is a risk, however, of black voters, especially those who are younger, staying home in November, which could complicate BidenтАЩs path to victory in a tight election. The тАЬBreakfast ClubтАЭ is particularly notable venue for BidenтАЩs comments because the program is popular among younger African Americans. Biden's selection of a running mate could help motivate voters. He's begun vetting contenders, a process he's said will likely last through July. Several black women are among those under consideration, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, Georgia voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Florida Rep. Val Demings, Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge and Susan Rice, ObamaтАЩs former U.S. ambassador to the UN.",0,0,0,0
3649,Laura Ingraham Tells Black Americans That Trump Understands Police Violence Because of Russia Probe,"SEARCH The Fox News host suggested Trump understood black pain over police brutality because he dealt with an тАЬout-of-control FBIтАЭ during the Russia investigation. Contributing Editor Fox News host Laura Ingraham attempted to explain to African-Americans on Thursday night that President Donald Trump can empathize with inequality and police brutality due to his тАЬown experienceтАЭ with federal investigators during the Russia probe. With protests raging across the nation over the death of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis police custody, Ingraham lectured protesters over the demonstrations devolving into violence and looting. After chastising the non-Fox media for supposedly fanning racial flames over the police killing and subsequent protests, Ingraham then decided to address the black community as a whole to tell them how they should properly protest the killing of George Floyd. тАЬNow, IтАЩm not going to pretend for a millisecond to know what itтАЩs like to be a black person in America,тАЭ she said. тАЬI donтАЩt. But the only thing I do know is that we all need to do better.тАЭ Reiterating that we need to тАЬdo better,тАЭ the conservative Fox News hostтАФwho once told LeBron James to тАЬshut up and dribbleтАЭтАФsaid the тАЬreal change agents in America are those who stay in their communities and build them up, not burn them downтАЭ before invoking a civil rights icon. тАЬRosa Parks is a beloved, global symbol of freedom and justice because of the determination and dignity to which she carried out her civil disobedience,тАЭ she said. тАЬWould burning a store have been more powerful and transformative? I donтАЩt think so.тАЭ Without skipping a beat, the pro-Trump Fox star then referenced the presidentтАЩs anger at the FBI and Justice Department during the Russia investigation to let black people know Trump understands their experience. тАЬAnd to our African-American fellow citizens, I say this: Given his own experience with an out-of-control FBI and unfair investigation, given all the work on criminal justice reform, President Trump knows how poisonous and out-of-control law enforcement process can be,тАЭ Ingraham proudly declared, concluding her mini-monologue.",1,3,1,3

ThereтАЩs a certain kind of white person who cannot stand to be challenged тАФ especially by a Black person. To question them, to talk back to them, to even take up space in their proximity, is considered an attack. Even if unconsciously, they believe in the system America is built upon тАФ a system that relies on Black inferiority. Advertisement тАЬIn this country American means white,"""" Toni Morrison once said. """"Everybody else has to hyphenate.тАЭ So when Amy charged Christian and yelled, тАЬIтАЩm going to tell them thereтАЩs an African American man threatening my life,тАЭ she knew the gravity of her words. Amy, not Christian, was the real danger.  Over the last few years, weтАЩve seen the videos of white women calling the police on Black people, especially Black children, for things as simple as napping, mowing lawns, and selling food. We call these women Karens. We have seen how teachers will call cops on first graders for throwing tantrums only for them to get cuffed with zip ties and traumatized as babies. All it takes is the slightest offense to warrant punishment in the eyes of some white folk. And they know when they feign fear, especially of a Black man, the odds that the police and vigilantes alike will avenge them are in their favor. Black people made up almost a quarter of victims killed by officers in 2019. We are only 13 percent of the population. ChristianтАЩs great threat to Amy, beyond calling her out, was offering treats to her dog -- the same dog she choked as she frantically yelled and threatened him. Advertisement Amy was betting on what happened to Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed by a white retired Georgia officer and his son in February. She was counting on the cavalier attitude toward Black life that led to the police killing of Breonna Taylor in March. On Monday morning in Central Park, Amy Cooper was wielding the kind of weaponry that led to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Monday evening. Floyd matched the description of a forgery suspect. Forgery. He was not armed. The police statement said he was sitting on a car when approached by officers. Initially, police said he got off the car on his own, but then resisted. Cops claimed they noticed he was in medical distress after they cuffed him and called an ambulance to the scene. But witness footage shows Floyd cuffed, body face down on the street, with a white copтАЩs knee casually resting on his neck like a piece of furniture. And they stay in that position for well over five minutes while Floyd is begging for his life, тАЬPlease, please, please, I canтАЩt breathe. Please, man,тАЭ he says. Instantly, we are taken back to the traumatic killing of Eric Garner in 2014. This time, there were consequences. By Tuesday afternoon, all four officers involved in the death of Floyd were fired and being investigated by the FBI. And, while Amy was not charged with making a false accusation, she lost both her job and her dog. Advertisement Following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday, we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved, effective immediately. We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton. Before she got fired, Amy turned to CNN to тАЬpublicly apologize to everyone,тАЭ insisting sheтАЩs not a racist and meant no harm. Except she did. She used Christian CooperтАЩs race repeatedly in their interaction, knowing the history attached to Blackness in America. She frantically screamed into the phone as if her life were actually in danger. The video shows he is the one who asked her not to come near him. Yet she put on a Broadway show starring Karen for the dispatcher to ensure peak white believability.   We live in a world where it is nothing short of a miracle that Christian survived this encounter with Amy. ThatтАЩs oppression. WhatтАЩs harrowing is how shocking it is that Minneapolis police were immediately fired over their involvement in the death of George Floyd. WeтАЩve come to expect no justice at all or a long march to even subtle penalties. тАЬMy stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please... I canтАЩt breathe,тАЭ Floyd grunts from the ground, bearing the officerтАЩs weight atop him. When you watch the video, the cops are unbothered by his pain and negligent when his body goes limp. They werenтАЩt arrested, though. Like Amy, they were fired. And we are in awe. Angry white ladies who use their privilege to hurt others are in their feelings over being called out and facing the consequences. Listen, Karen, before you complain about another meme, remember this: You exhale freely. Advertisement Black folk? We fight for every breath we take.

3736,House Democrats demand probes of police killings of black Americans,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Sarah N. Lynch 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Thursday asked the Justice Department to investigate systemic police misconduct following a spate of high-profile police killings of African Americans. The killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis, who died when a white officer pinned him down with a knee to the neck, and Breonna Taylor, shot in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment, raise questions as to whether police were engaged in a тАЬpattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct,тАЭ House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and the other Democratic members told Attorney General William Barr in a letter. The letter also asks the department to probe the local law enforcement authorities who were responsible for investigating the death of Ahmaud Arbery, another unarmed black man who was gunned down by a former police officer and his son while jogging in his Georgia neighborhood. тАЬPublic trust in the blind administration of justice is being seriously tested by recent high-profile killings of African-Americans,тАЭ Nadler wrote. The deaths of Floyd, Arbery and Taylor have garnered national attention and civil rights advocates say they are the latest in a long history of racially motivated attacks against unarmed black men and women by white police or perpetrators. The death of Floyd, 46, sparked sometimes violent protests this week, after video showing him gasping for air while a policeman kneeled on his neck went viral. It echoed the 2014 death of Eric Garner in New York, which helped fuel the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. The FBI has already opened investigations of the three latest incidents, and the department has said it is weighing whether to file hate crime charges against ArberyтАЩs killers. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions put the brakes on тАЬpattern or practiceтАЭ probes of alleged systemic discrimination in 2017, after he ordered the department to review consent decrees the Obama administration had struck with troubled police departments.

3750,Four police fired after shocking video shows them holding down African American man,"Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired after the death of an African American man held down with a knee to his neck as he protested that he couldnтАЩt breathe. The FBI is investigating the incident after a disturbing video showing part of the encounter circulated on social media. Watch the video above Officers responding to an alleged forgery in progress Monday evening were initially told that a person later described as the suspect was sitting on a car and appeared to be under the influence, police said. A pair of officers located the man, who was at that point inside the car, and who police said тАЬphysically resistedтАЭ the officers when ordered to get out. Officers handcuffed the man, who тАЬappeared to be suffering medical distressтАЭ, according to police.

The video did not capture what led up to the arrest or what police described as the man resisting arrest. тАЬPlease, I canтАЩt breathe,тАЭ the man said, screaming for several minutes before he became silent. Bystanders urged the officer to release the man from his hold. In a Facebook video posted Monday, bystanders urged the officer to get off the man.

3805,'With love from Ireland': Country rallies to assist Native American tribes which helped Ireland in Black '47,"Outdoor sculpture, 'Kindred Spirits' which commemorates the 1847 donation by the Native American Choctaw People to Irish famine relief during the Great Hunger, at Bailick Park in Midleton. Picture; David Creedon / Anzenberger """"We stand together, forever and always"""" - that's the message from Cork man, John Ryan, who donated to an online fundraising campaign set up to assist Native American people struggling with food shortages as a result of Covid-19. It's one of many messages of hope and encouragement written from people all over the country as Ireland has stepped up and donated to communities in the Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation, whose ancestors helped Ireland during the Great Famine. Two years into the Great Famine of 1845, death rates as a result of starvation, plague and disease combined with mass emigration lead to the most dramatic population decrease in the entire period of the Famine - a period which became known as Black '47. During this difficult time, the Choctaw Nation provided $170 of relief aid to the Irish to help them - the equivalent of over тВм4,500 today. """"Not long before the Great Hunger Famine in Ireland, 60,000 Native Americans, including the Choctaw people, had suffered through the experience of the Trail of Tears. """"The death of many people on the Trail of Tears sparked empathy for the Irish people in their time of need. """"Thus, the Choctaw extended $170 of relief aid,"""" one of the fundraisers, Vanessa Tulley explained. Expressing her sincere gratitude toward Irish people who have donated to the fundraiser, which will supply families with food, water and other essential supplies, Ms Tulley said Ireland has provided hope during an incredibly dark time. """"We are so grateful for the love and support we have received from all around the world. """"Acts of kindness from indigenous ancestors passed being reciprocated nearly 200 years later through blood memory and interconnectedness. """"Thank you, Ireland, for showing solidarity and being here for us."""" The Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation are extreme food deserts with only 13 grocery stores on Navajo to serve some 180,000 people and only three small grocery marts on Hopi to serve some 3,000 people. These communities also have high numbers of elderly, diabetic, asthmatic, and cancer-afflicted individuals, who are particularly at risk of contracting Covid-19. Thanks to the GoFundMe campaign, people all around the world have managed to raise close to $2m for vital supplies. In a message of support, Cork resident, Geraldine D'Arcy wished the community strength to get through this challenging time. """"I am from Cork in Ireland. I donated in solidarity with the American Native Community during this crisis,"""" she said. """"Bless you and I wish you the strength to get through this terrible time for your community.""""

3883,UK├втВмтДвs 1st African American and Africana Studies Major Graduates,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (May 5, 2020) тАФ Sydney Sayre appreciates the history sheтАЩs making in May as she graduates as the University of Kentucky's first African American and Africana Studies (AAAS) major in the College of Arts and Sciences. тАЬThe first black studies course took place at UK in 1969, and in 2020 IтАЩll be the first person to graduate as a major in African American and Africana studies,тАЭ said Sayre, who grew up on a horse farm and considers Lexington her hometown. тАЬI think history is all about new beginnings and change and that is what this program is doing at UK тАФ making history.тАЭ African American and Africana studies was available as a minor until 2019, when it became a major. Sayre, who is double majoring in history as well, accumulated enough credits to be the first student to earn the full major. тАЬI was delighted to find out that, even though Sydney was already a senior when the major came online, she was able to switch to the major,тАЭ said Anastasia Curwood, director of AAAS and associate professor of history. тАЬShe is dedicated to the field and has worked hard to complete the major in time for graduation.тАЭ Growing up in Kentucky, Sayre said her parents took her to many places of historical interest, particularly Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C. Sayre then studied history in an AP class at Bourbon County High School. Once she started at UK, however, she found that the story of African Americans in the United States ran much deeper than survey courses could portray. тАЬMy earlier classes never really touched on painful subjects; they were something they always glossed over,тАЭ she said. тАЬBut when I came to UK, I found such a different attitude about what history was and what could be done about it now. I took Dr. CurwoodтАЩs survey class of African American history from the Civil War to the present day, and I found out so much that I didnтАЩt know. There was a lot more to learn, and it really got me interested.тАЭ Classes taught by Curwood and Vanessa Holden, assistant professor of African American and Africana studies, provided even more incentive for Sayre to pursue this discipline. тАЬI took a course with Dr. Holden on slave resistance and rebellion that changed the way I thought about American history and what I was interested in researching,тАЭ Sayre said. тАЬAlthough itтАЩs such a painful history to learn, it allows me to recognize its effects in the present day.тАЭ As part of her major, Sayre conducted a capstone research project on how enslaved people migrated along with their slave owners across the Appalachian Mountains and settled in Kentucky in the late 18th century. The people in the forced migration from Virginia helped build some of the earliest infrastructure in the Commonwealth. тАЬOne of the things I was able to do was find out how much enslaved peopleтАЩs labor went into the horse industry,тАЭ she said. тАЬOne of the families that (brought enslaved people) from Virginia to Kentucky actually was a family that later on started Keeneland. When I happened to stumble on the documents, it was a real eye-opener.тАЭ Sayre was accepted to the graduate program in the history department at UK. She thanks her parents, Julie and Luis Martinez, for their support. тАЬThe faculty in history and AAAS are very proud of SydneyтАЩs pioneering double major,тАЭ Curwood said. тАЬShe has a keen sense of historical curiosity and itтАЩs been a pleasure to watch her grow as a scholar. We look forward to the contributions she is sure to make in whatever field she chooses.тАЭ The University of Kentucky is increasingly the first choice for students, faculty and staff to pursue their passions and their professional goals. In the last two years, Forbes has named UK among the best employers for diversity, and INSIGHT into Diversity recognized us as a Diversity Champion four years running. UK is ranked among the top 30 campuses in the nation for LGBTQ* inclusion and safety. UK has been judged a тАЬGreat College to Work for"""" three years in a row, and UK is among only 22 universities in the country on Forbes' list of """"America's Best Employers."""" We are ranked among the top 10 percent of public institutions for research expenditures тАФ a tangible symbol of our breadth and depth as a university focused on discovery that changes lives and communities. And our patients know and appreciate the fact that UK HealthCare has been named the stateтАЩs top hospital for five straight years. Accolades and honors are great. But they are more important for what they represent: the idea that creating a community of belonging and commitment to excellence is how we honor our mission to be not simply the University of Kentucky, but the University for Kentucky.",0,0,0,0

Growing up as the sensitive, slightly awkward child of three in a race-conscious space, she decided early on that sheтАЩd rather spend her time eating cookies and honey buns than taking on the weight of worldly issues. It helped her see that good food is the most powerful way to connect, understand and heal. Inspired by this realization, each one of her recipes tells a story. Orange Peel Pound Cake brings back memories of summer days eating Florida oranges at Big MaтАЩs house, Rosketti cookies reimagine the treats her mother ate growing up in Guam, and Plaited Dukkah Bread parallels the braids worked into her hair as a child. Jerrelle leads you on a sensual baking journey using the five senses, retelling and reinventing food memories while using ingredients that make her feel more in control and more connected to the world and the person she has become. Whole flours, less refined sugar and vegan alternatives make it easier to celebrate those sweet moments that made her who she is today.

4010,Drawing strength from Boston├втВмтДвs African American statues - The Bay State Banner,"Latinos underrepresented in state politics Boston budget battle brewing In the news: William Carson Latinos underrepresented in state politics Boston budget battle brewing In the news: William Carson One of the many perks of living in a city with such a rich history, besides bragging rights, is drawing perspective and understanding from the past. In its almost 400-year history, Boston has seen, and survived, a lot. A tour through some of BostonтАЩs statues reminds us that if weтАЩve come this far, we can get through this crisis too. In this bronze piece at West Newton Street and Columbus Avenue, steps from a sculpture of Harriet Tubman, a man and two women arise from the Tree of Knowledge. The figures stand tall, resolute and strong, a departure from common depictions of emancipation and slavery at the time. This is in large part thanks to the African American sculptor. Fuller was a prominent figure of the Harlem Renaissance movement and she created this sculpture in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Though the original plaster cast was made in 1913, BostonтАЩs bronze version wasnтАЩt installed until 1999.  Phillis Wheatley was brought to Boston on a slave ship in 1761 and put to work as a personal servant to the Wheatley family on what is now State Street in the financial district. At the time, she was 8 years old. Wheatley was a talented writer and published her first poem at age 12. Though her life was plagued with trials, slavery first and later poverty and three children who died in infancy, she never stopped putting her thoughts on paper. She became the first African American and first U.S. slave to publish a book of poems, as well as the third American woman to do so.  Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts54th Regiment Memorial PHOTO: COURTESY FRIENDS OF THE PUBLIC GARDEN One of the best-known statues of black history in Boston, the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial pays homage to one of the first African American regiments in the Civil War. The high-relief bronze monument took almost 14 years to complete. ItтАЩs particularly significant for the way Saint-Gaudens sculpted the faces. Often in group portraits, especially of African Americans, individuality was erased in favor of a nondescript mass. Saint-Gaudens used real people to model the soldiers and gave each face its own unique, individual look. The men are distinguishable as individuals to be honored separately as well as together in the regiment. Though the memorial was under restoration prior to the pandemic and may not be viewable on a socially-distanced walk right now, the piece is featured in a WGBH Forum Network panel discussion about the significance of race and public monuments, available on YouTube.

4289,Church Outbreak: A look at what├втВмтДвs next in WV├втВмтДвs effort to control COVID-19 in the state├втВмтДвs African American population,"WBOY.com Mount Zion Baptist CLARKSBURG, W.Va. тАУ As detailed in previous reports, a large gathering of members of north central West Virginia black churches in mid-March led to at least two COVID-19 deaths and a large number of positive cases. Out of that, a debate has arisen over how local and state officials responded to the situation. We know there have been deaths, hospitalizations and recoveries related to the church outbreak, but whatтАЩs next? тАЬWe are going to do targeted testing in our African American communities. We are looking at these communities and looking at them and doing the prudent type work that will enable us to insure that we wonтАЩt have critical problems in those communities as well.тАЭ As the debate continued in both traditional media and on social media, those were the words of West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice as he and state health officials announced the formation of an advisory task force focused on the stateтАЩs African American population. тАЬThat is for the African American issues, that will help with public outreach and education as we begin providing testing for this vulnerable population in several areas of the state,тАЭ WV DHHR Sec. Bill Crouch said. On Friday, Crouch gave an update on the task force, saying that potential members had been contacted and that an initial meeting was being planned for Monday. State Health Officer Dr. Cathy Slemp also offered up data illustrating that infection rates among African Americans in West Virginia exceed their percentage of the stateтАЩs population. Slemp promised that additional demographic data would be added to the DHHRтАЩs coronavirus dashboard by Friday evening. Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church member Romelia Hodges, whoтАЩs been outspoken since learning of the church outbreak, wants to meet with public health officials about the data. тАЬWe have individuals that were actually tested positive that were not counted in the public health officials count,тАЭ said Hodges. Marion County Health Department Administrator Lloyd White told 12 News that epidemiology for the county, including data related to the church outbreak, is still being completed. The latest numbers released by the health department show that Marion County has had 45 total cases. That includes the two deaths, six active cases and 37 recoveries. With the contact tracing not complete, it is unclear how many of those 45 cases are tied to the church celebration. The wife of Morning Star Baptist Church Pastor Wesley Dobbs is among those whoтАЩve recovered. тАЬNo symptoms are appearing in her. Everything going great. We are following the guidelines that the governor has set down. SheтАЩs doing great,тАЭ Dobbs said. Hodges and the team she formed to help with contact tracing are happy to see action being taken. тАЬSeeing the implementation of the three items we asked for from Dr. Marsh put into place. And were looking for the full effect of those going forward,тАЭ Hodges said. Team member Tiffany Walker-Samuels read an email from Dr. Marsh to 12 News: тАЬHe says appreciate you both.

4737,African American Reparations Bill has passed California Assembly,"A bill proposing compensation to African descendants of slaves has passed the California Assembly. The bill has passed the California Assembly on Thursday, with a 56-5 vote. The bill was already in play, but advanced most likely due to recent protesting and rioting these past 2 weeks after George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and a number of African Americans were murdered by police and white vigilantes. The bill still needs to pass the Senate, and be signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. If the bill passes 8 people with backgrounds in racial justice reform will lead a study and determine who would be eligible for compensation and how it would be rewarded. Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, a Democrat from San Diego who wrote the bill, and who also leads the Legislative Black Caucus, said the study will be including the fact that California participated in slavery, even as it joined the union as a тАЬFree stateтАЭ in 1850. Weber stated: тАЬThe discriminatory practices of the past echo into the everyday lives of todayтАЩs Californians,тАЭ The panel conducting the study will start meeting no later than June 2021. Many other races and groups have been given different forms of reparations or compensation.

4849,Black Americans bear the brunt of Trump├втВмтДвs environmental rollbacks,"Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., leading to the White House. TrumpтАЩs environmental rollbacks put vulnerable communities at risk, many of which are already burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic.Ted Eytan / Flickr This piece was published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here through the Climate Desk partnership. Under the cover of the pandemic, the Trump administration has been hard at work dismantling the rules that protect public health. He has reversed standards for clean cars and mercury emissions from coal plants. HeтАЩs suspended rigorous environmental reviews required by the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act to expedite approval of highways and pipelines in 30 days. And just last week, the Environmental Protection Agency altered how it calculates the lives saved from cleaner air тАФ a devastating change that will be used to undermine future clean air regulation. These rollbacks do not affect everyone equally тАФ theyтАЩre particularly devastating for people of color. And the pandemic has intensified the burden that vulnerable neighborhoods already carry. On Tuesday, in a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce committee, environmentalists and racial justice advocates detailed the compounding effects TrumpтАЩs rollbacks and pollution has on communities that have been hardest hit by COVID-19. According to CDC data released in April, Black patients accounted for 33% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and 23% of deaths тАФ disproportionately high numbers when you consider that 18% of the total US population identifies as Black. The disparity has been even more stark in some cities: In Washington, D.C., for example, Black people are 45% of the population but 76% of total COVID-19 deaths. The connections between the environment, race, and the COVID-19 crisis are many: Air pollution in poor communities has long caused soaring rates of respiratory and heart disease тАФ underlying conditions that are now worsening outcomes in people who contract COVID-19. The pandemic has also increased peopleтАЩs exposures to pollution: TheyтАЩre spending more time indoors, where outside pollution can seep in and mix with asthma triggers like mold. The lack of federal and state enforcement during the crisis has meant communities may face illegal levels of exposure to chemicals and emissions. And while transportation emissions are down overall, some neighborhoods see more emissions from idling trucks. тАЬWhen we say, тАШI CanтАЩt BreatheтАЩ we literally canтАЩt breathe,тАЭ Mustafa Santiago Ali, vice president of Environmental Justice at the National Wildlife Federation, said in his testimony. Jacqueline Patterson, Director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program, pointed out in her testimony that 71% of African Americans live in counties in violation of federal air pollution standards. тАЬAt every turn the deck is stacked against us.тАЭ Abundant research reinforces this point: A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences found that African American and Latino American populations are typically exposed to 56% and 63% more PM2.5 pollution than they produce through consumption and daily activities. By contrast, non-Hispanic white people are typically exposed to 17% less pollution than they produce. The American Lung Association summarizes the literature in its 2020 State of the Air report: Recent studies have looked at the mortality in the Medicaid population and found that those who live in predominately black or African American communities suffered greater risk of premature death from particle pollution than those who live in communities that are predominately white. Another large study found that Hispanics and Asians, but especially blacks, had a higher risk of premature death from particle pollution than whites did. This study found that income did not drive the differences. Higher-income blacks who had higher income than many whites still faced greater risk than those whites, suggesting that the impact of other factors such as chronic stress as a result of discrimination may be playing a role. Other researchers have found greater risk for African Americans from hazardous air pollutants, including those pollutants that also come from traffic sources. Due to decades of residential segregation, African Americans tend to live where there is greater exposure to air pollution. More recent research has found that COVID-19 outcomes are worse in high-pollution communities. In a preliminary study from Harvard in April, researchers found that even small increases in fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, corresponds to about an 8% increase in COVID-19 deaths. People who faced long-term exposure to pollution of 15 to 20 years in 3,080 US counties had much higher death rates from COVID-19. Yet Trump has turned a blind eye to the devastating connections between pollution and the pandemic. In the last week, heтАЩs also shortcut environmental reviews so the administration can expedite fossil fuel infrastructure projects, making it easier to build petrochemical plants, incinerators, and toxic dumps at the front steps of communities of color. Despite all this, Trump has spent the last week bragging about his environmental record, claiming, тАЬWe have the cleanest air weтАЩve ever had, like over the modern era.тАЭ That claim comes as an affront to people who work to clean up the most polluted neighborhoods. TrumpтАЩs rollbacks are an example of тАЬthe different kinds of ways that they kill us and have been killing us for generations,тАЭ says Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, BrooklynтАЩs oldest Latino community-based organization. Environmental regulations, she adds, can тАЬforce protections for those communities,тАЭ but тАЬwhen they are eviscerated, people are left with industries that run amok.тАЭ Rebecca Leber is a reporter in Mother JonesтАЩ DC bureau, where she covers environmental politics and policy.

5296,Northam announces new state highway historical markers highlighting African American history,"RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - Governor Ralph Northam said 20 new state historical highway markers highlighting African American history have been approved by the Virginia Board of Historic Resources. Five of the approved new markers were submitted by students across the state in the GovernorтАЩs Inaugural Black History Month Historical Marker Contest. тАЬThe CommonwealthтАЩs storied past is complicated and painful, but it is important to step up and tell a more inclusive story,тАЭ said Northam. тАЬAs we elevate Juneteenth, celebrating and acknowledging the contributions of our Black communities and history is a critical and imperative step forward--especially through historical markers that are highly visible across the Commonwealth.тАЭ The new markers highlight people, places or events tied to African American civil rights, education, health or the Civil War and Reconstruction-era history. тАЬThe purpose of the highway marker program is to educate the public by presenting an objective and truthful version of history.

5301,Which is right? Black vs. BIPOC vs. African American vs. POC vs. BAME,"In light of the heinous murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and many others have forced communities around the world to confront systemic racism. As a Black, American womanтАФalbeit a multi-racial and lighter-skinned Black womanтАФIтАЩve felt called to use my privilege and my platform to speak out how I can, with what I know. One of the questions IтАЩve been asked the most often is what terminology non-Black allies should use. Is Black an offensive term? Is African American accurate for all Black Americans? What is BAME and where did the term pop up from? This is my personal opinionтАФthere is a video explanation on YouTube, originally published as an IGTV video. However, here IтАЩll go into a slightly more detailed explanation: Black (with a capital B) is an umbrella term for anyone of African descent, regardless of nationality. Black is appropriate to use when referencing the general Black experience in the United States. In the past, there seemed to have been a movement to use the term African-American as it was seen as more тАЬPCтАЭ. However, not all Black people in the United States are African-American! Is Black a negative word? NO. IтАЩve received private commentary from white people saying that in their home towns and growing up they felt that calling someone Black had a negative connotation. However, by talking to them they eventually agreed that it was likely the discomfort in addressing race at all, and often the inflection with which racist people would call Black people Black which was the issue, and not the word itself. Say it loud: IтАЩm Black, and IтАЩm proud. POC is an acronym for People of Color, is for anyone visibly non-White (Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian, etc.) POC essentially means non-white. White people walk through the world with a set of privileges and treatment based on their whiteness and can be directly contrasted with non-white people. ThatтАЩs not to say white people donтАЩt have struggles, grief, hardship, or pain, but they do not suffer from systematic repression because of the color of their skin as non-whiteтАФor POCтАФdo. ThatтАЩs it! There is a lot of terminology floating around with different ways to refer to ethnic minorities. Which are correct, in what context, and why? See my ideas on the topic here. Click To Tweet BIPOC stands for Black/Indigenous/People of Color. This term has gained recent popularity as talks about race and individual racial experiences develop. BIPOC is rising in popularity because it is more nuanced than POC toward the unique history and experiences that Black and Indigenous people face in the United States. Black people suffer unnecessarily because the color of our skin is not valued in a white-centric society. Indigenous people are continually erased, stolen from, and neglected American society. While each individual race has their own struggles and none overshadows another, in the United States I believe it to be important to single out the Indigenous and Black experiences. Hence why I personally like using BIPOC over POC when generally referring to non-white people. This term often describes Black Americans who have a family history that directly links to African enslaved people who were brought to the United States between the 17th and 19th centuries. Because of this, itтАЩs rare that know their historical ethnic and cultural roots because they were systematically and generational removed. Over the centuries these races, cultures, and traditions were blended and created something else completelyтАФthis is the African American identity. Another term that IтАЩve just heard of recently. Here is the official definition by the originators of the term: ADOSтАФwhich stands for American Descendants of SlaveryтАФseeks to reclaim/restore the critical national character of the African American identity and experience, one grounded in our groupтАЩs unique lineage, and which is central to our continuing struggle for social and economic justice in the United States. Your daily race education: Terminology. Click To Tweet Someone might simply identify as Black-American if theyтАЩre like me: my father is Jamaican and my mom is white/American. IтАЩm biracial but visibly Black, but being born and raised outside of Jamaica I donтАЩt feel comfortable claiming to be Caribbean-American, because while that may be true technically (ethnically?), itтАЩs not true culturally. Thus, I identify as Black/Black-American because I am racially Black and American by culture. This term is the one that is the newest to me and that IтАЩm the least familiar with. BAME stands for Black/Asian/Minority Ethnic. тАЬMinority EthnicтАЭ is relatively similar to тАШPOCтАЩ, but more nuanced for Black and Asian people as itтАЩs a UK term and those are the ethnic majorities in that region. I donтАЩt know the history as I mentioned, but IтАЩve received commentary by UK residents that the term has recently fallen out of favor like POC as well because it isnтАЩt nuanced enough. I expect to see a new UK term coming to light soon! The ongoing movement called BLM is a Black rights movement and тАШBlackтАЩ is appropriate because racism is a worldwide issue. Black is not a negative or offensive term. But each term has itтАЩs own nuance and place in context! When in doubt, I believe people should be as specific as possible when addressing societal issues and topics connected to a certain race, you should just reference those people. Not simple enough? Basically, if youтАЩre talking about Asian issues, say Asian, if youтАЩre talking about Black issues, say BlackтАФsame goes for Indigenous-Americans, Latinx, Asian-American, African American, etc. DonтАЩt be lazy and use terms like BIPOC or POC when you really should be more specific because it erases that specific racesтАЩ history and unique voice. When youтАЩre referring to a specific daughter or sonтАЩs grades you donтАЩt say тАЬthe kids got a D in BiologyтАЭ. Be specific! There are complex ideas behind these terms and they can be confusing, but they are worth researching and trying to understand if you intend to use them. Some people might ask: why all the labels? It seems like these terms change every 5 minutes. PC culture is annoying. These terms divide people. When I hear this I hear тАЬI donтАЩt see colorтАЭ. We operate in a white-centric society that does not see us as equal. And itтАЩs not about тАЬnot seeingтАЭ our differences. WeтАЩll always have differences! We should acknowledge them accurately and appropriately and embrace them. So writers, media, and everyday people, please research these terms further on your own time if you intend to use them!   P.S. While weтАЩre here, race (Black, White) is what society sees you as, ethnicity is what you culturally and/or blood relation-ly identify as, and nationality is where your passport says youтАЩre from P.P.S. Capitalize the B in Black! But thatтАЩs another discussion. Did you learn anything reading this? Are you hearing of any of these terms for the first time?LetтАЩs chat in the comments. Thank you very much. That was really helpful. Thank you for this, especially how you distinguish тАЬrace,тАЭ тАЬethnicity,тАЭ and тАЬnationality.тАЭ IтАЩve retweeted to my tiny audience of copyediting nerds. I found your post after seeing тАЬBAMEтАЭ for the first time at RaceBaitr (https://racebaitr.com/2020/07/28/the-publishing-industry-cannot-continue-to-hide-its-anti-blackness-behind-their-blackbestseller/) and searched to find out what it meant. IтАЩm glad you found this helpful, Sonia! Thank you for taking the time to read it! It is very informative to have clear understanding of these terms and especially the acronyms as they seem to pop into media suddenly, thank you. Two questions; ADOS is described referring only to African descendants, how would southern and eastern European, and/or indigenous colonial slavery fit in? And how do Latinos fit into any of these criteria, perhaps as POC? Hello Laurent! To answer in reverse order, Yes, Latinx would fall into People of Color (POC) ЁЯЩВ And I believe ADOS was coined because of the long-standing, horrific nature of enslaved Africans in America based solely on the color of their skin. Though Eastern Europeans and Indigenous were sometimes indentured servants and slaves as you mentioned, it was not so long-standing and racially-based as ADOS were, and did not disconnect those people so much from their cultures and heritage, hence the motivation to coin the ADOS. Thank you for informing us, Gabby. This is such an important and helpful post on racial group terminology. Thank you for the comment Hazel IтАЩm glad you found it helpful!

5466,Opinion | Goodbye to a Symbol That Told Black Americans to ├втВм╦ЬKnow Your Place├втВмтДв,"Opinion The Mississippi flag is finally coming down. Credit...Illustration by John Whitlock; Photographs by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, via The New York Public Library, The New York Times, Associated Press, and Getty Images. Supported by By Natasha Trethewey Ms. Trethewey is the former poet laureate of the United States and the former poet laureate of Mississippi. The onslaught began the day I was born. As my mother made her way to the hospital, hundreds of Confederate flags lined the streets. It was Confederate Memorial Day, 1966, exactly 100 years since the holiday was first celebrated, and the celebrations that day were particularly fervent in the aftermath of recent advances in the civil rights movement: the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. The laws were changing, but the iconic symbol of white supremacy and Black oppression could still be enlisted to send a message. And the messages were everywhere. The landscape of my childhood was overwritten with monuments to and symbols of the Confederacy: They were in the names of roads, bridges, buildings, schools, parks, other public works and counties. And the state flag of Mississippi, incorporating the Confederate battle flag in its top inner corner, was among the most conspicuous. Its message was a kind of synecdoche, a part standing in for the whole: The South may have lost the Civil War тАФ a war fought to maintain slavery and white supremacy тАФ but Mississippi would not be inclusive of all her citizens except in the continuing narrative of white dominion over Black subjects. The inclusion of the battle flag within the state flag served as a visual reminder of white MississippiansтАЩ allegiance to that white supremacist heritage and was indicative of the new ways the state would find to maintain the second-class status of Black Americans. It waved to us again and again: Know your place. Now, this symbol of white supremacy is coming down. Last Sunday, lawmakers in Mississippi voted, finally, to replace the state flag, and on Tuesday the governor signed the measure into law. I canтАЩt say with any certainty that, had its fate been put to a popular referendum, a majority of white Mississippians would have voted to let the flag go. In 2001, nearly two-thirds of voters still elected to keep it, and there was plenty of opposition to its removal ahead of SundayтАЩs vote. That opposition is at the root of what makes Black Americans constantly confront the sense of being unwelcome in the place that is our home, a place where we should be able to expect justice and equal protection under the law. Growing up I felt early on that sense of dislocation, something akin to what the writer and scientist E.O. Wilson referred to as тАЬpsychological exile.тАЭ That is, even in my native land, I felt rendered an outsider whose history was not represented тАФ or if it was, was not represented accurately. On Ship Island, a barrier island off the Gulf Coast held by Black Union soldiers during the Civil War, for instance, a monument had been erected to the Confederate soldiers who had been interned there, but there was, until recently, no mention of the Black troops who guarded them. Such are the ways the monumental landscape, of which the flag is part, has erased the collective history of Mississippi and replaced it with a singular one, meant to glorify whites only. My mother knew well the various means that white Mississippians employed тАФ both legally and extralegally тАФ to maintain Black subordination and white supremacy. SheтАЩd grown up in the era of Jim Crow segregation and was 11 years old in 1955 when Emmett Till was murdered. A photograph taken outside the courthouse in Sumner, Miss., where the trial of the men accused of TillтАЩs abduction and murder was held, shows a large gathering of African-Americans. They stand at the entrance to the courthouse or sit at the base of the Confederate monument on the lawn. You can see the words тАЬOur HeroesтАЭ emblazoned beneath the battle flag graven there. Though you cannot see the state flag, it hangs there, too. Together, the flags presided over the message soon delivered: the all-white juryтАЩs acquittal of Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, the men who would later brag to Look magazine about murdering the child. There is yet another message, implicit in the imagery of the photograph. If the Confederate battle flag alone could signify virulent and dangerous forms of white supremacy, as it has increasingly over the years, the communion of the state flag of Mississippi and the battle flag sent a yet more insidious message: The state will preside over persistent injustice, turning a blind eye to white violence against Blacks. It was the continuing onslaught of that implicit message тАФ that the lives of Black people mattered less than the lives of whites тАФ that my mother was intent on countering as we navigated a landscape rife with it. Whenever we passed the state flag, often driving down the beach road that had been dedicated, on a plaque erected by the Daughters of the Confederacy, тАЬThe Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway,тАЭ my mother would sing to me the тАЬBattle Hymn of the RepublicтАЭ тАФ the antislavery, abolitionist version that had morphed into an anthem for Union troops during the Civil War. тАЬJohn BrownтАЩs body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his truth is marching on. тАжтАЭ She sang to counteract the symbolic, psychic violence of that flag, to remind me of the struggle for тАФ which means the possibility of тАФ justice. To Black Americans, Confederate symbols have always sent a variety of messages, and they are not innocuous. For too long, the symbolism of MississippiтАЩs flag has been complicit in sending a larger, national message of white supremacy тАФ not the literal violence of murders by white supremacists or police brutality, but the figurative violence of the messages sent by juries who fail to convict or even indict officers accused of using unwarranted deadly force; the messages sent by police departments when they take no disciplinary action against officers with records of using excessive force; the messages sent by a nation turning a blind eye again and again to video evidence of police brutality or the racist policing of Black people going about their daily lives. All of it an onslaught saying, Black lives do not matter as much as white lives. George Orwell wrote: тАЬWho controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.тАЭ The story of reunion and reconciliation between the North and the South after the Civil War wrote Black Americans out of the story, and monuments to the Confederacy, like MississippiтАЩs flag, helped to inscribe both a figurative and literal white supremacy onto the physical landscape and the psychic landscape of the American imagination. This is why contests over what symbols remain are important battles in a broader struggle for social justice, and why the removal of the current flag in Mississippi is significant. When symbols emblematic of white supremacy come down it means that the power to erect and maintain such symbols is shifting. Getting rid of the power of such symbols to visit a figurative violence upon African-Americans is a step toward ending the literal manifestations of institutionalized white supremacy. Even ceremonially renaming the street leading to the White House and painting on it a giant banner reading Black Lives Matter is akin to running a new flag up the pole. It is not an empty gesture, but a small step toward change, part of the larger, ongoing fight for justice. And it makes visible what has been invisible, giving it a kind of primacy. I never thought IтАЩd see this moment in my lifetime.

5515,Black Social Worker Sues American Airlines for Detaining Her After a Passenger Accused Her of Kidnapping a White Child In Her Care,"A California Black social worker is suing American Airlines for detaining her after they claimed she had kidnapped a white child who was in her professional care. Court documents state Sharon Murphy is a social worker who has been employed with the Riverside County Department of Public Social ServicesтАЩ ChildrenтАЩs Services Division since 1999, per The Press-Enterprise. On Oct. 29, 2019, she was on a flight from Fort Worth, Texas, to Ontario, California, with a 1-year-old white child who had completed a court-ordered visit with his father. Another passenger reportedly told a flight attendant тАЬthat Ms. Murphy was holding a kidnap victim,тАЭ according to the suit, which was filed June 17 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Airline workers reportedly approached Murphy and demanded she surrendered the child. Murphy had identification, the childтАЩs birth certificate and a court order but the employees тАЬtook the boy from MurphyтАЩs arms and threatened her with force if she didnтАЩt comply,тАЭ the papers state. She was held for about an hour before she could re-board the plane. The child in MurphyтАЩs care was confused for another missing child, the suit alleged, even though the other child is Hispanic and 5 years old. Murphy accused American Airlines of violating her civil rights, negligence and false imprisonment. The court papers state she has suffered from nightmares and insomnia since the encounter. тАЬHad American Airline(s) (researched the matter) first prior to hauling Plaintiff, Ms. Murphy, off the plane and detaining her and the one-year-old Caucasian male dependent, Ms. Murphy would not have suffered the mental, physical and psychological harm flight personnel inflicted upon her,тАЭ the lawsuit said, according to The New York Post. She wants unspecified damages and compensation for her medical expenses. American Airlines acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement to several media outlets. тАЬWe are reviewing the lawsuit and the details of the flight,тАЭ the statement read. тАЬWe take the safety and comfort of our customers very seriously and weтАЩre committed to providing a positive experience for everyone who travels with us.тАЭ Atlanta Black Star is a narrative company.

5597,How Black Lives Matter fits into the long history of American radicalism,"тАЬAny movement that goes to the root of things is radical.тАЭ Black Lives Matter was created in 2013 by three Black women тАФ Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi тАФ in response to the acquittal of Trayvon MartinтАЩs killer, George Zimmerman. Over the last seven years, it has evolved into something much bigger: a broad multiethnic liberation movement focused on criminal justice reform, racist policing, and adjacent causes. During the course of this shift, the movement has not only expanded but become more radical in its demands for equality across the board. And yet, surprisingly, this has increased, rather than diminished, its appeal. BLM had little support across the country as recently as 2017. But it has become steadily more popular, and in the aftermath of George FloydтАЩs murder, its popularity has surged to the point that itтАЩs now supported by a majority of Americans. By any measure, that suggests BLM is succeeding тАФ culturally and politically. But how should we think of Black Lives Matter as a historical phenomenon? Is it the sort of radical social movement weтАЩve seen before in this country? Or is it something new, something different, without any precursors? To get some answers, I reached out to Michael Kazin, a professor of history and American social movements at Georgetown University and also the co-editor of Dissent magazine. We discussed how BLM fits into the long tradition of American radicalism, what its proponents can learn from previous eras, and why he thinks BLM is both a political and a cultural struggle. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows. As someone who studies the history of social movements in America, how do you view this moment? ItтАЩs a remarkable moment in some ways, because we have a very unpopular right-wing president and a set of popular social movements on the left. Which is surprising, because usually social movements on the left get more popular when you have a liberal or progressive president in office. This is what happened in the тАЩ30s and тАЩ60s, for example. I think we might be witnessing the end of a conservative era. What does the end of a conservative era mean? Well, weтАЩve had Democratic presidents in this era, Clinton and Obama, but the guiding ideas of the time have been conservative ideas about government and labor and race. And now that could be changing in a very radical way. If Democrats are able to win the presidency and tip both houses of Congress, then you could see another major vault to the left in American history, the kind of vault we saw during Reconstruction and during the progressive eras in the тАЩ30s and тАЩ60s and early тАЩ70s. But all of this energy doesnтАЩt always translate to big legislative revolutions. For laws to pass, itтАЩll take a combination of left-wing social movements and politicians who are willing to accommodate those movements in important ways. The Black Lives Matter movement is at the forefront of this leftward push. Do you consider BLM a radical social movement, or does it just seem that way to those who are more invested in the current order? Like all large social movements, it has its radical aspects and its more reformist aspects. That was true of the labor movement in the тАЩ30s, which had a lot of communists and socialists in it. It was true of Reconstruction too, in which you had more radical Republicans like Thaddeus Stevens, who wanted to confiscate the land of anybody who had fought for the Confederacy and give it to African Americans, to freed slaves. We saw it in the тАЩ60s as well, when the Black Freedom Movement had its reformist side pushing for integration of institutions and the Voter Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, and you had the Black Panthers and other Black Power groups who wanted one big revolution. So you see this dynamic in every mass social movement. ItтАЩs hard to say what will become of BLM. YouтАЩve got the different aspects to it. People can unite around some moderate demands like passing laws that will handcuff the police in terms of their capacity to use violence. The more radical aspects, like abolishing the police altogether, go much further. And there are conversations about reparations and restructuring the economy to ensure not just equal opportunities but equal outcomes. As the movement gets larger, youтАЩll see more differences within it. But no single one of those manifestations will define the movement as a whole. What makes a тАЬradicalтАЭ movement radical? Is it more about the nature of the demands? Or how those demands are perceived by the power structure? ThatтАЩs a very good question. The power structure, of course, often perceives any movement that wants to change the fundamentals of how the country operates as radical. Martin Luther King Jr. was perceived to be a radical тАФ and I think he was. But the demands he was making publicly, until the end of his life, really werenтАЩt that radical. He simply wanted the 14th and 15th Amendments to be applied to Black people. Any movement that goes to the root of things is radical. An anti-capitalism movement is radical. A movement which calls for reparations for African Americans is radical. ThereтАЩs a radical ethics that diagnoses something wrong about the basic organization of society and seeks to undo that wrong, and conservative figures in power have always viewed these efforts as existential threats. The New Deal was perceived as radically socialist by a lot of people in business and in the power structure, but in retrospect it was really just reformist. The shifting perception of these movements is fascinating to me, especially in this moment. In the case of Black Lives Matter, itтАЩs remarkable to see just how popular it has become. In the last two weeks alone, I believe, support for BLM has increased as much as it has in the last two years. What does that signal to you? It signals that racial attitudes in America, which began to change after World War II and then took a big step forward in the 1960s with the success of the Black Freedom Movement and the Civil Rights Act, have really evolved. This has been a very long and hard road, with moments of backlash along the way, but this is what youтАЩd expect because racism is so deeply woven into that fabric of American history and culture. Obviously, the horrific killing of George Floyd was a catalyst, but I think weтАЩre seeing the results of young people coming of age and being much more open to racial equality than previous generations. And BLM, whatever one thinks of it, strikes me as the continuation of some of the most successful social movements in American history. I think thatтАЩs right, and two of those movements, the Abolitionist movement and the Black Freedom Movement, were also organized around the demands of equality for African-Americans. Of course, you could say this is all part of one long movement, but it had various phases to it. I think what weтАЩre seeing now is very much part of the Black Freedom Movement, which has had its ups and downs throughout its history. But the thread tying all of it together has always been the push for fundamental equality at every level of society and in every major institution. WhatтАЩs interesting about BLM is that it could be a catalyst to a reform movement in the same way the labor movement in the тАЩ30s was essential to moving the Democratic Party to the left. A lot of people donтАЩt know this, but it was really in the тАЩ30s that the Democrats began to move away from Jim Crow. It took a long time, obviously, but thatтАЩs when it started, and it was because labor was interracial and labor was crucial to the success of the Democrats in the тАЩ30s and тАЩ40s. How were these previous movements greeted when they emerged? I ask because the goals seem, in retrospect, so sensible and obvious, but I imagine at the time they were seen as extremist and threatening. Definitely. The great Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci talked about how social movements can change the common sense of society. What we all take to be normal or moral in society can change pretty quickly, and it changes because of the force and success of social movements. Black Lives Matter has been enormously successful in this respect. Any movement pushing for this level of change will be opposed by people who donтАЩt support those changes тАФ thatтАЩs just an axiom of politics. WhatтАЩs astonishing about this movement is that itтАЩs not provoking more backlash тАФ at least not yet. Well, I wonder about the тАЬnot yetтАЭ part. I worry about movements like Black Lives Matter or тАЬabolish the policeтАЭ becoming so sprawling and disjointed that they lose their focus, or get overwhelmed by revolutionary spasms that may undercut the key goals. Are there important lessons from the past on this front? I was a New Leftist in the late тАЩ60s. I was one of those people who went too far. I think I undermined some of my goals, even though in the end we were successful in winning our main demands, which were to fight for racial equality and an end to the Vietnam War. But along the way I did some stupid things. I think one big lesson is that mass lawbreaking undermines a movement. As MLK used to say, you want the other side to be seen as the violent side, you want the other side reacting to your civil disobedience, to your respect for order. You donтАЩt want to be seen as running amok without leadership, without discipline, because youтАЩre trying to bring about change and people are scared of change. You donтАЩt want people to be scared of you at the same time theyтАЩre scared of change. ThatтАЩs one lesson. Another lesson is the importance of building alliances. One of the reasons why I keep saying that leftists should support Biden and ally with Pelosi and Chuck Schumer this year is that we have to get as many Democrats as possible elected because only then will there be the political space to go further than they would like to go. There are limits to what a movement can create on its own. Eventually, youтАЩve got to get laws passed, and a movement canтАЩt pass laws by itself. Is it better to view BLM or тАЬabolish the policeтАЭ less as political projects and more as cultural movements that shift the zeitgeist and therefore pave the way for political changes in the future? ItтАЩs a great question, and I think itтАЩs both for me. As I said before, itтАЩs obviously helped to change the attitudes of a lot of white Americans and thatтАЩs a cultural change in consciousness. Without that change in consciousness, we canтАЩt get real political changes because there would be too much resistance to them, and politicians are averse to doing things which are unpopular. So itтАЩs important to demand immediate change but also wise to not expect it to happen that fast. These things take a long time. If activists donтАЩt have a longterm strategy, theyтАЩre going to fail. This isnтАЩt easy, of course. On the one hand, you want movements to build on a sense of urgency when outrage happens, the way it did with George Floyd and with other Black Americans killed by the police. But at the same time, you canтАЩt let that sense of urgency impede you from organizing for the long-term. My sense is that weтАЩre still very much in the beginning of whatever this is, and so thereтАЩs a lot of symbolic activism and a lot of enthusiasm but not necessarily a clear strategy for seizing power. What do you think a movement like this can do to channel all this energy and goodwill into enduring, concrete changes? I think it has to find ways to work with other movements on the left. The change these activists seek is one of economic equity as well as an end to racist treatment by the cops. That was true for the Black movement in Fredrick DouglassтАЩs day as well as the freedom movement led, in part, by MLK in the 1960s. The fight to have the power over how the police treat you is necessarily a fight to gain more power and resources on the job, in oneтАЩs neighborhood, and in education. But Black people canтАЩt win that fight by themselves. It will take allies from other races and a demand for universal programs in health care, the environment, housing, etc. тАФ and interracial institutions like labor and, yes, the Democratic Party.

5645,Black Marine who carried American flag into Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa,"By World Tribune on July 23, 2020 by WorldTribune Staff, July 23, 2020 A black Marine Corps veteran, who lives one block away from the federal courthouse in Portland that is being besieged by rioters, said Antifa thugs followed him home after he marched into the chaos while displaying his American flag, a report said. тАЬFor more than 50 nights, Gabriel Johnson, 48, a retired Marine, has been kept awake by the sounds of rioting and explosions taking place outside his window in Portland,тАЭ Fox News reported on Thursday. тАЬAfter two months of living in fear, at 3 a.m. Sunday he had had enough.тАЭ Johnson said: тАЬAt that point I [had] counted 82 explosions and just thought, you know, somebody has to do something.тАЭ When he entered the chaotic scene while holding his American flag, Johnson said he knew his actions would be more than a little divisive to the leftist mob. But the retired Marine said he was not prepared for the reaction he received. тАЬI was being called the N-word by Black people. People were chasing me around with baseball bats,тАЭ Johnson told Fox News. тАЬAntifa has infiltrated Black Lives Matter,тАЭ Johnson said as he described a woman dressed in Black Lives Matter gear who showed him threatening footage of protesters following him back to his home, and letting him know they were keeping tabs on him. According to Johnson, the woman was also holding an Antifa pen and was communicating with others via walkie-talkie. тАЬThese people have nothing to do with Black lives. Our Black community leaders need to stand up and lead because whatтАЩs happening is theyтАЩre letting a group of terrorists that donтАЩt represent me use me, and thatтАЩs not right,тАЭ said Johnson. Johnson said a 65-year-old Black veteran had stepped in to attempt to stop the burning of JohnsonтАЩs flag, only to be beaten by members of the mob. тАЬHe said, тАШthereтАЩs no way youтАЩre gonna burn this flag.тАЩ That was followed up by Black Lives Matter, Black men, running after this man, punching him in his face, grabbing the flag and throwing it over the fence,тАЭ Johnson told Fox News. тАЬI look at everything from a patriotтАЩs point of view. IтАЩve spent a lot of time fighting for our country. And so my belief in and my patriotism for this country is unmeasured тАж I fought for this country and this is not what I fought for,тАЭ said Johnson. The lifelong Portland resident blames the destruction of his city on the inaction of local leadership. тАЬThe lack of police response, city response, response from our mayor has just given free rein to holy hell to take place at that 11 oтАЩclock hour to 3 in the morning.тАЭ As for the federal officers who have been sent by the Trump administration into Portland over the past week to end the violence, Johnson doesnтАЩt oppose the extra assistance. тАЬIn absence of the local police what do we expect?тАЭ he said. тАЬIf we as a city arenтАЩt going to police ourselves, then we should expect someone to come in and police for us.тАЭ Intelligence Brief __________ Replace The Media anarchists, Black Lives Matter, Black Marine who carried American flag into Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa, Black Marine who displayed American flag amid Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa, Gabriel Johnson, WorldTribune.com  Black Marine who carried American flag into Portland chaos was followed home by Antifa added by World Tribune on July 23, 2020View all posts by World Tribune тЖТ (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Want to help revive the Free Press in America?

5652,African American Salons and Barbershops Offer a Blueprint for How America Should Be,"Historically, these venues have acted as a Black townhall, providing an inspiring example for how communities can come together to create positive change. According to Straight Razors and Social Justice: The Empowering Evolution of Black Barbershops, for many African Americans, getting a haircut is more than a commodityтАФitтАЩs an experience that builds community and shapes political action. As both a proud symbol of African American entrepreneurship and a relic of an era when Black labor exclusively benefitted whites, Black barbershops provide a window into our nationтАЩs complicated racial dynamics. The ongoing pandemic and intensifying urgency of the Black Lives Matter movement are even more poignant for Black men and women who are more likely to face financial fallout, severe illness, and even morbidity from the economic, social, medical, and political conflagration that is consuming our nation. African Americans are no strangers to tragedy, loss, and injustice. In fact, our history is uniquely defined by them, which is why we have had to find ways to come together as a community and find strength in what makes us the same rather than what makes us different as people. One way weтАЩve done this is by identifying safe spaces where we as a people can go to be ourselves, share our culture, and exchange information about the most pressing issues of the day. Historically, salons and barbershops have been such safe spaces, and are second only to church in importance to Black men and women, because they represent more than just a place to recharge and attend to personal care. African American salons and barbershops are a sacred space where men and women can go to connect with others in their communities and exchange ideas about news, politics, health, and entertainment. To understand this dynamic, you have to understand the beginnings of Black salons and barbershops in America. Before the late 1800s, Black barbers primarily worked as slaves for white men and listened in to the political conversations those men hadтАФparticularly about slaveryтАФas they provided haircuts and shaves. Some white men even used Black barbers as sounding boards and as a link to the Black community. When slavery was abolished, many Black men and women stopped working for white men and opened their own shops where they could serve their own communities. But they kept the political conversations going. These are trusted environments, In short, Black lives mattered in Black barbershops and salons before the Black Lives Matter movement. Black barbershops and salons acted as a town hall for African Americans, and as such, they have played a key role in Black culture and politics ever since. It wasnтАЩt just barbershops either. Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first women to create Black hair care products and AmericaтАЩs first female millionaire, created a chain of beauty schools that taught other women how to care for African American hair. Her national spokesperson and one of her chief advisers, Marjorie Stewart Joyner, started out taking classes from Walker, and ended up building a network of over 200 beauty schools, where she oversaw the training of more than 15,000 stylists. Joyner, like Walker before her, learned to leverage that network to make political gains for the Black community. Her network was so effective, President Lyndon B. Johnson personally recruited her to help turn out black voters for his campaign in 1964. Because Black salons and barbershops were Black-owned, free spaces, they were central to civil rights activism and often moonlighted as literal townhalls where Black men and women could gather to organize and expand their political networks. Profits from these businesses were often funneled into political movements to support marches, create protest signs, and even bail protesters out of jail. Today, salons and barbershops continue to hold their place in the Black community and still act as more than a place to get a fade or perm. Stylists and barbers do more than just shape hairтАФthey shape the culture one style at a time. In the shops, we can literally and figuratively let our hair down and celebrate our own culture. They are a mirror that shows the true reflection of who we can be, and they help ensure that when we look into the mirror, we also see ourselves for who we really are. Before I started my marketing agency, I worked behind the salon chair for 20 years, and I saw every day the waysтАФlarge and smallтАФthat the salon acted as a hub of my community. People would cook and bring their food there to sell (what I call the original Uber eats). They would bring in CDs of music they wanted to share, and they would bring stories. In Black beauty shops there is no such thing as the mezzanine, because you have a standing R.S.V.P. for the front row of these festivities. But it goes even deeper than that. In these spaces, if someoneтАЩs son gets into college, we celebrate together. If someone is sick, we rally to help them. If someone dies, we mourn together. This is how America is supposed to work, but in many communities today we are separated not just by zip codes, but by codes of conduct and political divides so deep we might as well be on another planet from one another. But the blueprint is there. Black folks have differences too. WeтАЩre not monolithic. We donтАЩt all vote the same, praise the same, or live the same way. At the salon or barbershop, it doesnтАЩt matter. We are free to join the conversation and share our thoughts, and we can watch as others pick them up and study them like stones they found on a beach. Others may chime in and add to what we said. They may say they heard differently. But what they wonтАЩt say is, тАЬYou donтАЩt belong here,тАЭ because, at the end of the day, we are brothers and sisters. We all belong. If only America could embrace that sentiment, our country could be stronger than ever before. Imagine if we could all simply spend a day, side by side, at the salon or barbershop and wash away our misunderstandings. If we could untangle our anger and uncertainty or shave away racism, fragility, and entitlement and style it into the shape of a society that we can be proud of. Human beings are social creatures, and we need a place to come together. A place where we arenтАЩt being torn apart. Black salons and barbershops have been that place for African Americans for hundreds of years, and so far, the results have been beautiful. ThatтАЩs because in a barbershop or salon, every patron is equal, and everyoneтАЩs story matters. Children are brought there by their parents who take their own kids there when they are grown. Black barbershop and salon owners are the architects of a blueprint Black society canтАЩt survive without. People feel safe, cared for, and respected in Black beauty venues. We should all have a chance to feel that way in America, too. We have a blueprint for it, we just have to use it. Black barbershops and salons provide a window into our nationтАЩs complicated racial dynamics. #BeautySalons #Barbershops #AfricanAmerican July 6, 2021  April 23, 2021  September 21, 2020 ",0,0,1,3
5722,Vote yes on Amendment 2 to save African American lives through expanded healthcare access," There is no question that communities of color in our nation face significant health disparities. African Americans have higher rates of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and maternal mortality than their white counterparts. The life expectancy of an African American is almost four years lower than the average. Disparities are even more glaring in Missouri, where the life expectancy for African Americans is 5.2 years shorter than for whites. African American mothers in the Show-Me State are more than twice as likely to deliver very low birth weight newborns (VLBW) compared to white mothers, and African American newborns in Missouri are about 60% more likely to be born prematurely than white newborns. These statistics are alarming, and they represent centuries of systemic racism baked into medical practice and public health in the United States. We need radical change in the way our medical students are taught, the way our doctors administer treatment to African Americas, and the way we collectively take care of the health and well-being of our communities. This change will require a bevy of political, cultural and medical changes to be effective, and many of these changes won't be made by the general public. But one major change that can help Missouri move in the right direction, and is achievable only if the general public approves it, is Medicaid expansion. On August 4, Missourians across the state will head to their polling places to vote in our state's primary election. ItтАЩs not just candidates on the ballot, though. We will also be voting on a constitutional amendment. Amendment 2, if passed by the people, will expand Medicaid in Missouri, bringing in a 90% federal match to administer and expand our state's Medicaid program. That could mean more than 226,000 Missourians will finally have affordable healthcare. Of that number, roughly 36,000 more African Americans would have access to much-needed healthcare. From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we know Medicaid expansion improves diabetes and hypertension control, increases early-stage cancer diagnoses, and shores up hospital budgets, especially in rural hospitals. We also know that, in states that have expanded Medicaid, low-income familiesтАФthe main benefactor of Medicaid expansionтАФsee increased access to a personal physician, more annual check-ups, and better long-term treatment for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and more. Researchers also found that Medicaid expansion is significantly associated with lower maternal mortality by 7.01 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. This type of access to care can save livesтАФespecially in Missouri's African American communities, which experience the worst health outcomes of any group. Medicaid expansion is also good for our state's pocketbook. Analysts at Washington University in St. Louis predict that Medicaid expansion in Missouri is likely to be approximately revenue-neutral, with the potential for cost savings in 2020 and with increased cost savings likely over the 2020-2024 time horizon. This means that Missouri's budget won't increase, but our state's revenue has the potential to increase by somewhere around $39 million in 2020 alone when Medicaid is expanded in the state. Expanding Medicaid in Missouri is the best option for everyone in our state, but especially for communities of color. On August 4, voting """"Yes"""" on Medicaid expansion means you are helping to move our state in the right directionтАФtoward a future with equitable and effective health outcomes for each and every Missourian, no matter their zip code or race.

5878,"NYT: African Americans, Latinos are Contracting COVID-19 at 3 Times the Rate of Caucasians","The New York Times released a blistering report about the effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on People of Color in the United States. According to data the Times sued the CDC to have access to, Black and Latino people are contracting the virus at 3 times the rate as their White counterparts.

5888,Trump bristles at question about police killing Black Americans,"WASHINGTON (AP) тАФ President Donald Trump bristled at a reporterтАЩs question about police killing African Americans and defended the right to display the Confederate flag as he continued to play into racial divisions in a pair of interviews Tuesday. In one interview, Trump seemed taken aback when asked why African Americans are still dying at the hands of police. """"And so are white people. So are white people. What a terrible question to ask. So are white people,"""" Trump told CBS's Catherine Herridge. """"More white people, by the way. More white people."""" There is no national database tracking police-involved shootings. But studies have shown that Black Americans are much more likely to be killed by police, even though more whites тАФ who make up a larger portion of the population тАФ are killed. One study that examined the use of lethal force by law enforcement from 2009 to 2012, for instance, found that while victims were a majority white (52%), they were disproportionately Black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among Blacks than whites. Trump's comments drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union's Jeffery Robinson, who issued a harshly worded statement saying Trump's answer """"not only ignores the fact that per capita Black and Brown people are disproportionately killed by police, it provides the foundation for the dangerous and unconstitutional police practices that result in the deaths of Black people with regularity. """"Trump's racism is so absolute that he continues to refuse to give even a tacit acknowledgment to the epidemic of police violence against Black people in America,"""" Robinson alleged, accusing Trump of """"using the violence and suffering perpetrated against Black communities as a white-supremacist dog whistle ahead of the coming election."""" In the interview, Trump also defended the use of the Confederate flag, despite saying in 2015 that he believed the flag belongs in a museum. """"All I say is freedom of speech. It's very simple. My attitude is freedom of speech,"""" Trump responded. """"Very simple. Like it, don't like it, it's freedom of speech."""" Asked whether he understood the flag is a painful symbol to many because it is a reminder of slavery, Trump told CBS that some """"people love it,"""" adding: """"And I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're not thinking about slavery."""" Trump has been under fire for his response to the mass anti-racism protests that broke out across the across the nation following the killing of George Floyd in police custody. In the face of demands for racial justice and equality, Trump has instead leaned in on a law-and-order message, painting mostly peaceful protesters as domestic """"terrorists"""" and continuing to stoke divisions. In a second interview with the conservative Townhall Media, Trump defended the white St. Louis couple captured on video brandishing guns as they defended their home during one racial injustice protest. Trump claimed that Mark and Patricia McCloskey """"were going to be beat up badly, if they were lucky"""" and said their house would have been """"totally ransacked and probably burned down"""" had they not been out there. """"And now I understand somebody local, they want to prosecute these people. It's a disgrace,"""" he said. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson told reporters that he spoke with Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr by phone earlier Tuesday and that the president expressed concern that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, may file charges against the couple. тАЬI think the president didnтАЩt like what he was seeing, and the way people are being treated,тАЭ Parson said, adding, тАЬI think youтАЩll see some sort of actions.тАЭ Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Fewer than half (47%) of respondents aged 18 to 29 say they plan to vote for Biden, while 8% support President Trump and 45% say they will vote for someone else, wonтАЩt vote, or arenтАЩt sure. Younger Black Americans constitute a key set of swing voters тАУ between voting Democratic and opting out тАУ that could impact 2020. Older Black Americans, by contrast, express far more support for Biden: 73% of respondents 30 and older plan to vote for Biden, and among those 60 and over itтАЩs close to 90%. The survey finds that BidenтАЩs chances will markedly improve if he chooses a Black running mate. He would gain 49% of those who otherwise say they are unlikely to vote or likely to vote for someone else; that will increase his overall support among 18-29 year-olds to 73%. тАЬLooking at 2020, this survey is a flashing yellow light for Joe Biden and the Democrats, who have yet to capture the support of younger Black voters,тАЭ said David Barker, Director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American UniversityтАЩs School of Public Affairs, and one of three AU researchers who conducted this study. тАЬDemocrats cannot expect support from this new generation of Black Americans тАУ they have to earn it.тАЭ The survey also found: The survey also revealed motivations for voting. Almost 80% of younger Black Americans say that support for the Black community is a reason to vote, but they have little faith in the political process or the parties to address their concerns with almost half of the respondents saying they generally donтАЩt vote because тАЬit does not make any difference anyway.тАЭ тАЬThe voice of younger Black Americans comes through clearly in this survey: pay attention to our community, hear our concerns, address our needs,тАЭ said Sam Fulwood III, a fellow at AUтАЩs Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies. тАЬWe may lean one way politically, but donтАЩt take our vote for granted or expect us to support you or your party if all we get is lip service and no real change to the status quo.тАЭ The survey also revealed attitudes toward police and a lack of faith in elected officials and the political process. When respondents 18-29 were asked if they тАЬfear the police may harm you or people that you care about,тАЭ 80 percent say тАЬyes,тАЭ and 82% say the criminal justice system often treats Black people unfairly. When asked who is most effective in ensuring that change takes place on issues like police misconduct, younger Black Americans rank Black Lives Matter higher than any other group, with elected officials coming in seventh behind Black elected officials, protesters, educators, business leaders, and journalists. тАЬWe need this generation of Black Americans to engage politically, but the candidates and the political system need to engage them,тАЭ said Leonard Steinhorn, a professor in American UniversityтАЩs School of Communication. тАЬNot meeting them halfway will turn them into voters who swing not between the political parties but between grudging engagement and opting out тАУ and neither is healthy for our democracy.тАЭ The survey тАУ a representative sample of 1,215 randomly selected Black respondents from Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida with an overweight of 593 of 18-29 year-olds тАУ was conducted online from July 1-9 by the African American Research Collaborative, a national survey research firm specializing in the African American community.

6253,"Survey shows half of Black and Hispanic Americans fear hospital visits for heart attack or stroke, because of COVID-19","Madison (WKOW) -- Every second counts in a medical emergency, but in this pandemic, many are second guessing getting help. """"Time matters, when it comes to heart attacks and when it comes to strokes. And I want to simply say, you matter,"""" says SSM Health Wisconsin Regional President Damond Boatwright. The American Heart Association released new data from a survey conducted online by The Harris Poll. It found more than half of Hispanics, 55%, would be scared to go to the hospital if they thought they were having a heart attack or stroke because they might get infected with COVID-19. 41% would stay home if they thought they were experiencing a heart attack or stroke rather than risk getting infected at the hospital. That survey also found that nearly half of Black Americans, 45%, say they would be scared to go to the hospital if they thought they were having a heart attack or stroke because they might get infected with COVID-19 and a third, 33%, would stay home if they thought they were experiencing a heart attack or stroke rather than risk getting infected at the hospital. Comparatively, less than half of Whites, 40%, would be scared to go to the hospital if they thought they were having a heart attack or stroke because they might get infected with COVID-19 and less than a quarter, 24%, would rather stay home than risk getting infected at the hospital. Boatwright says he isn't surprised by the results. """"I will tell you, there are a lot of people in vulnerable situations culturally, pre-COVID, who had a fear of going to the hospital. My family is one of them, ironically enough. In terms of my dad and my mom and my grandparents."""" He says it's important to know hospitals and ambulances are taking every precaution to keep people safe and following CDC guidelines. The AHA has launched an awareness campaign called Don't Die of Doubt, reminding people that hospitals are the safest place for them in the event of a heart attack or stroke. """"Call 911, as soon as you see the earliest signs and symptoms and indications.""""

6375,Roots of African American Herbalism: Herbal Use by Enslaved Africans,"Username Password Lost Your Password?  This article cannot possibly cover more than 400 years of herbal use and knowledge by enslaved Africans and their descendants. This is just the beginning of my journey as a Black herbalist understanding my own history, the plant knowledge contained within it, and my ancestral connections to herbalism. This post skims the surface of the exploration and reclamation work that needs to be done by the herbal community to decolonize itself and help honor African American herbalismтАЩs traditions, knowledge, and stories. Plants brought more than healing to enslaved Africans; they brought light, flavor, connection, remembrance, and joy into the otherwise dire and cruel living conditions experienced under slavery and subsequent economic and social oppression. Herbalism was a daily practice of empowerment and healing for men and women alike because there were very few other options for healing.  According to Sade Muse of Roots of Resistance, African American herbalism is a rich melange of many cultural traditions with deep origins rooted in African history dating back to ancient Egypt. It includes Arab and Asian practices that crossed paths due to trade and cultural exchange on the African continent. As enslaved African people crossed the Atlantic with the transatlantic slave trade, their herbal knowledge and practices were influencedтАФas well as appropriated byтАФEuropean slavers. Leah Penniman of Soul Fire Farm and the author of Farming While Black has noted that enslaved Africans were often selected for their agricultural expertise because Europeans were not used to farming in the warmer climates of the Caribbean islands and the southern United States (Penniman, 2018). In this way, their knowledge of plants тАФas well as their forced laborтАФ made them vital to the success of the colonies. After arriving in the Americas, cohabitation and collaboration with Indigenous Americans meant that enslaved Africans were then introduced to knowledge of local plants and their medicinal ways. Therefore, African American herbalism is a hybrid of all the knowledge that enslaved Africans came into contact with leading up to and throughout their enslavement. Early African American herbalism was based on a relationship and connection to the land. Enslaved Africans brought the seeds of their homelands braided into their hair and the knowledge of medicinal plants in their stories and songs (Penniman, 2020). However, much of the herbal knowledge gained in America came from direct connection, necessary learning, and the use of plants foraged in the woods, forests, and wetlands that provided a refuge from enslavement on plantations. For enslaved Africans and their descendants, herbalism and spiritual nourishment were intertwined. Plants supported their endurance and resilience in the face of enslavement. As herbalism gains popularityтАФand peoplesтАЩ awareness of systemic racism also growsтАФwe need to investigate the intersection of herbalism and systemic racism. To truly honor the African American roots of modern Western herbalism, a vitally important aspect of healing work is to recognize the Eurocentric views and cultural appropriation that modern herbalism has participated in. The European colonists observed the herbs and plants used by enslaved Africans who sought more regular contact with Indigenous communities when their medicines werenтАЩt working. There was a complex relationship between colonizers and the enslaved when the practice of herbalism was involved.  On one hand, colonizers wanted enslaved AfricansтАЩ healing knowledge, especially when their own remedies were not working or European medicine was too expensive to import. On the other hand, European colonizers also feared African тАЬroot medicinesтАЭ and did not want enslaved people to be empowered in any way. For enslaved Africans, herbal knowledge was a tool for liberation and spiritual, emotional, and physical health. Highly sought-after herbal supports could even be used as bargaining tools for freedom. European colonizers feared poisonings and uprisings, but also needed the herbalism of the peoples they oppressed, though many forbade the practice of herbalism. As Leah Penniman (2018) explains: By the mid 18th century, both Virginia and South Carolina made it a capital offense for enslaved people to teach or learn about herbal medicine and prohibited us from working in apothecaries. Further, European Americans borrowed from African medicinal knowledge, then erased the stories of the originators over time. For example, in the 1863 edition of Resources of the Southern Fields and Forests, the entry on boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum) includes, тАШthis plant is extensively employed among the negroes on the plantations in South Carolina as a tonic and diaphoretic on colds and fevers, and in typhoid pneumonia so prevalent among them.тАЩ By the time the Peterson Field Guide was published in 1990, boneset was merely described as a тАШcommon home remedy of 19th century America, extensively employed by American Indians and early settlers.тАЩ The Black herbalists were erased. (p.190) Many Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) have been robbed systematically of their connection and access to the landтАФand to herbalismтАФbecause it was stigmatized and made unsafe for them to practice. This robbed them of the knowledge of their ancestral herbals, folkways, and rich traditions. Today, because of systemic racism and historic erasure, modern African Americans have been cut off even further from the very practices, foodways, and knowledge that helped their ancestors survive and build resiliency during enslavement. It is important to recognize the appropriation of Native, Indigenous and African medicine in Western herbalism. As we become more aware of the systemic oppression of black bodies in this countryтАФand the appropriation of resources and laborтАФwe learn to recognize the same threads through herbalism. We need to nurture this traditional herbal knowledge back to health. Decolonizing Western herbalism starts with asking hard questions. Where has modern herbal knowledge come from? What has been taken from African American herbalism without proper recognition? Whose knowledge do we uphold? Whose voices and stories do we listen to, record, and publish when it comes to our working relationship with plants? Whose ancestral traditions and knowledge have been excluded from herbalism?  Enslaved Africans cultivated their own gardens and foraged locally, but they didnтАЩt often use the plants grown on the plantation. African American herbalism was by its very nature what we now call тАЬbioregional herbalismтАЭ because they had to use the plants that were immediately available around them. Roots, bark, leaves, and berries were utilized at different stages. This implies that many enslaved Africans had complex herbal practices of identifying plants at different stages, knowing what was poisonous and what was not, and then choosing a few plants over many because they had knowledge of the exact function of that plant. Enslaved Africans often chose foraged plants over cultivated ones as тАЬcultivation, however, supplied only a small portion of the herbal repertoire of enslaved communitiesтАЭ (Fett, 2000, p. 122). Forests and wetlands proximal to plantations served as apothecaries to source plant allies as well as a place of solace. As shared by a former slave from Maryland,тАЬThe old people could read the woods just like a book, whenever you were sick they could go pick something out, and youтАЩd get well.тАЭ (Fett, 2000, p. 122). EveryoneтАЩs grandmother knew how to heal from the plants in their own backyards because access to healthcare was limited by structural racism. When food was scarce, weeds were food. Every neighborhood had a medicine woman, and Black folks entrusted their health not to the modern medical system but to plant medicine. Because it worked.  Historically, herbs were used and maximized in ways that were accessible to enslaved communities and later by African American communities with little economic access. Water infusions were the primary method usedтАФeither infusions for internal consumption or for external washes. Making decoctions and infusions was the easiest method to create herbal preparations for enslaved people. Poultices were another common application of herbs for external maladies. Tinctures were rarely used because access to alcohol was limited and enslaved peoples were not given alcohol. After enslaved people were freed, it was still too expensive to make tinctures.  Mullein is native to northern Africa, Europe, central and west Asia. ItтАЩs now widely naturalized throughout temperate climates and grows invasively in disturbed soils and alongside roads, old fields, and pastures. Mullein was used widely in African American healing traditions and is rich in minerals, vitamins, and nutrients. Some of its wide array of uses included easing colds and respiratory conditions, such as coughs, congestion, whooping cough, and chronic bronchitis. Mullein was also used for its anti-inflammatory properties for arthritis and gout (Lee, 2017, p. 288) The leaf was used in tea, in a bath or soak for joint pain, and as a poultice. As Dr. George Washington Carver (who is discussed further below) described, тАЬI wish to say mullein is one of the oldest of our medicinal plants and is a noted remedy for all kinds of coughs and colds, rheumatic troubles, stopping of blood, asthmatic affections, and all manner of things that human ills are heir to. It is of unusual value along that line, one of the best known of household remedies. The flowers are especially valuable in aggravated cases of earachesтАЭ (Penniman, 2018, p. 194).  Cotton is native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including Africa, India, Asia, and Central and South America. Cotton herbalism has been used for centuries within Native American populations, as well as in African and Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Cotton seed, cotton bark, and cotton root have been historically used in womenтАЩs health and menstruation. Folk practitioners have historically made tea out of cotton roots to ease labor. The root, bark, and seeds also cause uterine contractions. Some enslaved people used cotton as an abortifacient through the induction of uterine contractions (Hamby, 2004, p. 59). Cotton was a plant they were familiar with from their homeland and were now forced to work in fields of it. With these actions, cotton became a plant that symbolized both oppression and empowerment. Note: The Herbal Academy does not endorse or encourage the use of cotton seed, bark, or root as an abortifacient, for which it is very dangerous. This information is included solely for historical reference and context.  Native to eastern North America, sassafras root tea has a history of use as a seasonal blood cleanser. Sassafras is aromatic, stimulant, diaphoretic, and alterative. The leaves, twigs, bark, and roots can be decocted to regulate, purify, and balance the body. Sassafras compresses were used for external infections, burns, rashes, chronic rheumatism, and gout (Lee, 2017).  Basil includes over sixty species native to Africa and Asia and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions, such as the Meditteranean. Many types of basil were brought from Africa, including African blue basil (Ocimum kilimandscharicum), African basil (Ocimum viride), and tulsi basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), and it was a sacred plant to enslaved Africans. Basil has been historically used to reduce anxiety and stress, boost immunity, and soothe cold and flu symptoms. Basil can be used topically to soothe itching and pain due to insect bites. Basil was also used in a spiritual or energetic sense as herbal cleansing, burned to remove negative energy and protect a home (Penniman, 2018).  Wormwood is native to Southern and Eastern Africa (Penniman, 2018). Wormwood is a bitter, and a tea of wormwood was used to eliminate worms, which plagued many enslaved children as their living conditions often caused a spread of parasites. Topically, wormwood can repel insects due to its volatile oil content. It has a history of use in African American herbalism for anemia, and it helps with the absorption of nutrients (Penniman, 2018) as well as aids in digestion (Lee, 2017). Enslaved Africans and their descendants kept their ancestral herbal traditions alive at great risk. There are many forgotten bearers of this knowledge, but two rather well-known African Americans of history who helped keep herbal traditions alive were Harriet Tubman and George Washington Carver Harriet Tubman (March 1822 тАУ March 10, 1913) used herbalism, botany, and knowledge of the natural world around her to help others. Harriet and her passengers on the Underground Railroad used plants to calm babies and help them sleep for the journey. It is estimated that 300 people escaped slavery under HarrietтАЩs passage. Her knowledge of plants used for food and medicine ensured the safe passage of many enslaved Africans and she aided both white and black soldiers wounded in the Civil War (Penniman, 2018).  George Washington Carver (1864 тАУ January 5, 1943) mastered chemistry, botany, mycology, and herbalism. He was born into slavery in 1864 in Missouri. He was an agriculturist, botanist, teacher, and inventor. He received his masterтАЩs degree from Iowa State University as the only black student. He looked to free African American farmers through soil regeneration, and he invented historic farming methods including crop rotation. George Washington Carver was taught simple herbal applications from his ownerтАЩs wife, Susan, and loved working with plants and experimenting with soils and natural pesticides. He became known as a plant doctor. His work was to heal the land and his people, and his studies led him to learn that cotton depleted soils. He found nitrogen-fixing plants, like peanuts, soybeans, and sweet potatoes could restore soils and dramatically increase yields (Penniman, 2018).  Western herbalism has work to do to repair and honor the ways in which Black herbalism has informed its practices and knowledge. This article only serves as the beginning and as an invitation to learn the history of Black herbalism, which has been foundational to herbalism in the United States. The work of reclamation involves listening to the voices, stories, and rich knowledge of Black herbalists and the Black community that have been handed down through generations. It is also to support the Black community as they do the work to celebrate their roots, and reclaim and repair their connection to the plants and the land.

6917,First African American graduate of Rice University continues to make history,"The odds were stacked against him in the 60s, but Raymond Johnson says he never let fear intimidate him and he certainly never let it interfere with his education. HOUSTON - He was the first African American to earn a degree from Rice University in the 60s. He then went on to become one of the first Black faculty members at the University of Maryland. """"I think the world is a better place now than it was 50 years ago,"""" said Raymond Johnson. The odds were stacked against him in the 60s, but Raymond Johnson says he never let fear intimidate him and he certainly never let it interfere with his education. The now 77-year-old was one of the first black students admitted to Rice University in 1963. Johnson was pursuing a PhD in mathematics, but his life was never quite that simple. """"Two alumna file suit to stop Rice from desegregating and to uphold William Marsh Rice's will. So as a result when fall came, I was not able to enroll in classes. Instead, I was a research associate for the first year. Now, the university won the suit and until the second year in 1964, I became a student,"""" Johnson said. Growing up the small town of Alice, Texas, just outside of Corpus Christi, Johnson was familiar with the concept of тАЬkeeping his head down.тАЭ His life in grad school proved no different. As the only African American student in his math group of six, it was like he lived two parallel lives in Houston. """"8 to 5, I was in the Rice environment, but from 5 until the next morning, we were out in Third Ward. Surrounded by other African Americans, listening to our music and you know our entertainment,тАЭ he said. """"Sometimes I had to go outside the math department bubble and then I frequently ran into a problem if I was in Houston. So when I first got there, the restaurants were segregated. They would just say тАШwe don't serve, we don't serve your kind. We don't serve African Americans.тАЩ That's the way it was,тАЭ Johnson said. тАЬIn those days, you know, there were certain places where you knew you couldn't go or you could expect a very chilly reception if you went.тАЭ JohnsonтАЩs intellect and courageous attitude continued to break barriers for him and countless others following in his footsteps, inspired by his accomplishments. Upon graduating from Rice in 1969, Johnson became the first black faculty member at the University of Maryland where he would spend the next 41 years teaching. Eventually his career, brought him back full circle to Rice returning as a math professor in 2009. """"I've always felt, I guess I've always felt like I was equal to everybody else. Most of the people in the program treated me like I would equal to everybody else. And so to me it was just very straight -- I was there to get an education,"""" Johnson said. In 2015, Johnson was invited to the Oval Office to meet President Barack Obama, after winning the Presidential Award for Excellence in Math Mentoring. In the last few years, JohnsonтАЩs been enjoying retired life in Columbia, Maryland with his wife. His advice to those maneuvering a new wave of civil unrest is actually quite simple.

7278,"Tapes: Trump Said He Does Not Feel Any Responsibility to Understand the 'Anger and Pain' of Black Americans, Thinks Obama Is 'Not That Smart'","Excerpts from a new book by journalist Bob Woodward reveal that President Donald Trump said he does not feel a responsibility to understand the тАЬanger and painтАЭ experienced by many Black Americans. He also expressed dismay over a lack of support from Black voters, and commented on the intelligence of former President Obama. The Washington Post shared excerpts of the book entitled тАЬRageтАЭ in advance of its Sept. 15 release. The Post also shared audio clips from interviews Woodward conducted with Trump between December 2019 and July 2020, which serve as the basis of the book. During a recorded June 19 conversation, after the death of George Floyd and during the national outrage that followed, Woodward asked Trump about his view on Black AmericaтАЩs anger and pain. тАЬDo you have any sense that that privilege has isolated and put you in a cave to a certain extent, as it put me and I think lots of white privileged people in a cave and that we have to work our way out of it to understand the anger and the pain, particularly, Black people feel in this country?тАЭ Woodward asked. тАЬNo,тАЭ Trump responded. тАЬYou really drank the Kool-Aid, didnтАЩt you? Just listen to you. Wow. No, I donтАЩt feel that at all.тАЭ When pressed to acknowledge the predicament of Black people, Trump said, as he has previously, that he has done more for Black Americans than any president besides Abraham Lincoln. When asked days later if he believed systematic or institutional racism exists in America, he responded, тАЬWell, I think there is everywhere,тАЭ according to an audio clip. тАЬI think probably less here than most places. Or less here than many places.тАЭ Following pressure from Woodward, he said it was тАЬunfortunateтАЭ that systemic racism exists in America. During a conversation on July 8, Trump lamented about the dismal support heтАЩs received from Black voters, saying, тАЬIтАЩve done a tremendous amount for the Black community,тАЭ adding, тАЬand, honestly, IтАЩm not feeling any love.тАЭ He shared his thoughts on former President Barack Obama: тАЬI donтАЩt think ObamaтАЩs smart,тАЭ Trump said to Woodward. тАЬI think heтАЩs highly overrated.

McCarthy has refused to take a strong stand against the most dangerous members of his caucus, trying to allow the extremist Congressmen and Congresswomen to actively lie, disrupt House business, and spread hate on a daily basis. Because they are raising millions. In response to Republican white supremacist members of Congress Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona announcing they are forming the тАЬAmerica First Caucus,тАЭ McCarthy tried to stand up to those radicals, as Forbes notes, via tweet. It did not go well.

Kellerman cited a report published earlier this month by the U.S. Crisis Monitor project, a joint effort by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) and the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University. ACLED receives funding from the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, a State Department office.

Along with ESPNтАЩs Kellerman, the ACLED report has been cited favorably by the New York Times, the Washington Post, Time, and dozens of TV and newspaper outlets around the United States. The study has not gone uncriticized, however. тАЬThe report, generally speaking, classifies demonstrations as either peaceful or as riots,тАЭ wrote Seattle radio talk show host Jason Rantz at Newsweek earlier this month. тАЬThis simplistic view is troublesome because in many big cities where these violent demonstrations have unfolded, police departments have purposefully stood down and not declared a riotтАФand, in some cases, havenтАЩt even been involved in quelling them for fear it would exacerbate the problem.тАЭ Given the relative infrequency of violence that the ACLED study purports to show, Rantz argued, could be used to тАЬjustify . . . less coverage of the violence.

7752,Why Haitian Americans in Brooklyn have aligned with Black Lives Matter,"NEW YORK тАФ Protesters donned black on that afternoon a few months ago, as theyтАЩve done for weeks. This time, they also came bearing the bright colors of the Caribbean. There was the blue, gold and green triband of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; the Golden Arrowhead of Guyana; and HaitiтАЩs blue and red bicolor, with its coat of arms in the center. Hundreds of people gathered at the corner of Church and Flatbush avenues on June 14 for the Caribbean Americans for Justice march in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters marched through the heart of BrooklynтАЩs Flatbush neighborhood, dotted with roti shops, Haitian bakeries and markets selling everything from dried plantains to sugar cane. Haitian culture is woven into the fabric that defines Flatbush. And the Haitian community has woven itself into the movement for racial justice and police reform that started in late May after George Floyd died when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. тАЬItтАЩs not like weтАЩve taken it upon ourselves to say that, тАШthis is ours,тАЩ as much as weтАЩve taken it upon ourselves to say that, тАШwe are part of this,тАЩтАЭ said Haitian American Josue Pierre, who attended the march for justice. Pierre also serves as the Democratic Party leader for New YorkтАЩs 42nd Assembly District. Haitian Creole, which distinguishes Haitian culture from other Caribbean populations, developed on plantations in the former French colony of Saint-Domingue long before the enslaved African people there defeated the French in a revolution to establish Haiti, the worldтАЩs first Black republic in 1804. тАЬThe same way Black Americans are struggling with historical trauma generated by racist slavery, itтАЩs the same thing for Haitian people,тАЭ said Judite Blanc, a research psychologist at New York University. Demands in the Haitian community in the wake of George FloydтАЩs death are diverse. Before New York City agreed to reduce the police department budget this summer, Pierre had called for a $1 billion cut, with more money allocated for programs like Summer Youth Employment, which he said benefit youth of color. He also said the police department's leadership does not reflect the city's diversity. More than 75% of officers above the rank of captain are white, although white people make up a minority of patrol officers. NYPD Lt. Claude Celestin, who serves as president of the Haitian American Law Enforcement Fraternal Organization, estimated that more than 600 Haitian police officers work in the department, a force of about 36,000 uniformed personnel. тАЬAs far as minorities joining the police department, thereтАЩs been a lot of progress, but I think thereтАЩs a lot more that can be done,тАЭ Celestin said. Other community members want to see investment in Black communities, to alleviate the structural inequities that have existed since slavery. тАЬWe need reparation in general for slavery and colonization; this is what the discussion is about,тАЭ Blanc said. тАЬIтАЩm not interested in just defunding the police.тАЭ Black Americans, immigrant or not, face the threat of being singled out and mistreated by law enforcement based on skin color, according to Black Lives Matter Brooklyn President Anthony Beckford, who has Jamaican ancestry. As Haitians established themselves in New York, they too became victims of police brutality. In 1997, police in Brooklyn brutally assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima while he was handcuffed. Other cases include the deadly shooting of unarmed Patrick Dorismond by an undercover detective in 2000 and the lethal 2002 shooting of Haitian immigrant Georgy Louisgene, a Flatbush resident. Communities of Black immigrants have come together in the past to protest police brutality. But now the solidarity is more widespread, more visible. тАЬNow, people are like, тАШyeah, this is getting out of hand, itтАЩs affecting us all.тАЩ I believe George Floyd awakened a spirit among everybody,тАЭ Beckford said. And people attending the march for justice, holding signs bearing names like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, said their demands are simple. тАЬWe all just want to go outside, live our lives and be peaceful, and we donтАЩt want our skin color to be weaponized against us,тАЭ said Jeff Paul, a Haitian American protester. The protesters that day represented many countries, but they all shared a common cause. тАЬWe are in lockstep with our African American brothers and sisters on this,тАЭ Pierre said.

7792,Huge Swing: Poll Finds Majority of Americans Do Not Approve of Black Lives Matter,"A new Associated Press poll finds that there has been a huge 15 point swing and that the majority of Americans now disapprove of Black Lives Matter protests.  тАЬThe poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 44% of Americans disapprove of protests in response to police violence against Black Americans, while 39% approve. In June, 54% approved. The new survey was conducted Sept. 11-14, before WednesdayтАЩs announcement that a lone Louisville police officer would be charged in the Taylor case, but not for her actual death.тАЭ Summit report: The figures are also interesting when broken down along racial lines. Just 35% of white Americans approve of the protests, down from 53% back in June. Just Latinos, 31% approve, compared with 44% in June. Support for BLM amongst African-Americans has also dropped from 81% to 63%. As Chris Menahan notes, тАЬAP-NORC chose to exclude Latinos from their chart to make it seem like this is just a Black vs White thing.тАЭ Support for BLM amongst Republicans has also dropped from 29% to 9%. Meanwhile, 70% of Democrats still approve of the protests, while significantly more people on both sides of the political spectrum believe the demonstrations to be тАЬmostly or all violent.тАЭ The survey also finds that belief in the central underpinning narrative pushed by BLM, that blacks are being indiscriminately targeted by police, is being eroded. тАЬOverall, Americans are less likely than they were in June to say deadly force is more commonly used against a Black person than a white person, 50% vs. 61%. And fewer now say that officers who cause injury or death on the job are treated too leniently by the justice system, 52% vs. 65%.тАЭ The numbers are clear тАУ supporting Black Lives Matter is a losing election issue.

8847,"Physics Nobel Prize awarded to British, German and American scientists for black hole research","The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which confers the Nobel Prize, announced that this yearтАЩs award for Physics will go to three scientists: British, German and an American astrophysicists for their discoveries about the intriguing phenomenon of the universe, the black hole. The academy has decided to award this yearтАЩs prize with one half to Roger Penrose and the other half jointly to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez. тАЬPenrose showed that the general theory of relativity leads to the formation of black holes. Genzel and Ghez discovered that an invisible and extremely heavy object governs the orbits of stars at the centre of our galaxy. A supermassive black hole is the only currently known explanation,тАЭ the statement said. The prize amount is 10 million Swedish kronor (about Rs 8,22,85,318). Penrose employed mathematical methods in his proof that black holes are a direct consequence of Albert EinsteinтАЩs general theory of relativity. READ | Nobel Medicine Prize 2020: Three scientists awarded jointly for Hepatitis C virus discovery In January 1965, ten years after EinsteinтАЩs death, Penrose proved that black holes can form and described them in detail; at their heart, black holes hide a singularity in which all the known laws of nature cease. His groundbreaking article is still regarded as the most important contribution to the general theory of relativity since Einstein. Genzel and Ghez, using the worldтАЩs largest telescopes, developed methods to see through the huge clouds of interstellar gas and dust to the centre of the Milky Way. Stretching the limits of technology, they refined new techniques to compensate for distortions caused by the EarthтАЩs atmosphere, building unique instruments and committing themselves to long-term research. Their pioneering work has given us the most convincing evidence yet of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. David Haviland, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said: тАЬThe discoveries of this yearтАЩs Laureates have broken new ground in the study of compact and supermassive objects. But these exotic objects still pose many questions that beg for answers and motivate future research. Not only questions about their inner structure, but also questions about how to test our theory of gravity under the extreme conditions in the immediate vicinity of a black holeтАЭ.

Archbishop Wilton Gregory posed for a portrait following mass at St. Augustine Church in Washington. Pope Francis has named 13 new cardinals, including Washington D.C. Archbishop Wilton Gregory, who would become the first Black U.S. prelate to earn the coveted red cap. In a surprise announcement from his studio window to faithful standing below in St. PeterтАЩs Square, Sunday, Oct. 25, 2020, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated to a cardinalтАЩs rank in a ceremony on Nov. 28. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) VATICAN CITY (AP) тАФ Pope Francis on Sunday named 13 new cardinals, including Washington D.C. Archbishop Wilton Gregory, who would become the first Black U.S. prelate to earn the coveted red hat. In a surprise announcement from his studio window to faithful standing below in St. PeterтАЩs Square, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated to a cardinalтАЩs rank in a ceremony on Nov. 28. Other new cardinals include an Italian who is the long-time papal preacher at the Vatican, the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, a Franciscan friar; the Kigali, Rwanda, Archbishop Antoine Kambanda; the Capiz, Philippines, Archbishop Jose Feurte Advincula, and the Santiago, Chile, Archbishop Celestino Aos Braco. Another Franciscan who was tapped is Friar Mauro Gambetti, in charge of the Sacred Convent in Assisi. The pope, when elected in 2013, chose St. Francis of Assisi as his namesake saint. Earlier this month, the pontiff journeyed to that hill town in Umbria to sign an encyclical, or important church teaching document, about brotherhood. In a reflection of the popeтАЩs stress on helping those in need, Francis also named the former director of the Rome Catholic charity, Caritas, the Rev. Enrico Feroci, to be a cardinal. Gregory, 73, was picked by Francis to lead the prestigious diocese in the U.S. capital last year. The prelate has his pulse on factions in the U.S. Catholic Church, which has both strong conservative and liberal veins since he served three times as the head of the U.S. Conference of Bishops. Nine of the new cardinals are younger than 80, and thus eligible to elect the next pontiff in a secret conclave. Some cardinals head powerful Vatican offices, and pontiffs frequently turn to cardinals for advice. No details were immediately given by the Vatican about the concistory, as the formal ceremony to make the churchmen cardinals is known, especially in view of travel restrictions involving many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. As he has in other groups of cardinals he tapped in his papacy, Francis in this selection reflected the global nature of the Catholic Church and his flock of 1.2 billion Catholics. Others receiving the honor include a Maltese prelate, Monsignor Mario Grech; Monsignor Marcello Semeraro, an Italian serving as prefect of the Vatican office which runs the saint-making process; Bishop Cornelius Sim, a Brunei native who serves as apostolic vicar of Brunei; the Italian archbishop of Siena and nearby towns in Tuscany, Augusto Lojudice; the retired bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, Monsignor Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel; and an Italian former Vatican diplomat, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi. Churchmen over 80 who are named cardinals are chosen to honor their life of service to the church. Those in this batch too old to vote in a conclave are Cantalamessa, Tomasi, Feroci and Arizmendi Esquivel. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

8946,├втВм┼УWe Want the Flag Back├втВм┬Э: Celebrating Black American Patriotism,"Sign in Western States Center Jul 4, 2020┬╖6 min read By Eric K. Ward & Lecia J. Brooks тАЬThat day, the American flag was the image, the symbol, that pulled us into that situation. We live in America: the American flag means good things. It means that we can go where we want to go. We can ride our bike down any street in America. But it really represented a symbol of Do Not Enter. So they took that beautiful image and turned it into something ugly for me. And I want the flag back.тАЭ ~ Ren├йe Lipscomb-McDonald, from тАЬA Racist Attack Was Caught on Camera. Nearly 45 Years Later, It Still Stings,тАЭ interviews with the Black adults who were subject to a hateful attack as children in New York City in 1975 When our country celebrates Independence Day, the dominant images are of apple pie, red-white-and-blue bunting hanging from white picket fences, and blond-haired, blue-eyed children holding little flags along a parade route. This is a good year to think instead of Crispus Attucks, among the first to die in the war for American independence, a stevedore born to an enslaved African father and an enslaved native Wampanoag mother. To look to the young people leading the Movement for Black Lives, a movement to liberate American humanity from the shackles of systemic racism. And to lift up the story-tellers like Ren├йe Lipscomb-McDonald who can reflect on the harm done by white people using the American flag as a weapon of racial hatred, and still love that flag, and say, тАЬI want the flag back.тАЭ This is the patriotism we celebrate today: Black American patriotism, inspiring, leading, and joining with people of all colors and every national and ethnic origin to say, weтАЩre fighting for an America that belongs to all of us. Independence Day is a good day to take stock. Of all that was taken from the indigenous people who thrived here before the arrival of European colonists and settlers and enslaved Africans. Of the ways those enduring crimes continue to show up today. For Black America and Native America, the war didnтАЩt end with the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Look at todayтАЩs casualty figures: 1 in 1,500 Black Americans has died from COVID-19 (66 deaths per 100,000), 1 in 2,300 Indigenous Americans has died from COVID-19 (43 deaths per 100,000), compared to 1 in 3,600 White Americans (28 deaths per 100,000). As The Washington Post reports, тАЬThe virusтАЩs asymmetrical assault on Black communities may help explain why so much of the public underestimated the crisis. A new Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that nearly 1 in 3 black Americans knows someone who has died of COVID-19, compared with just 9 percent of white Americans.тАЭ And there you have the impact of structural racism. Not only is Black America imperiled by the vulnerability to this virus derived from environmental racism, relegation into low-wage тАЬessentialтАЭ work, and generations of discriminatory barriers to healthcare. But it turns out white America is imperiled, too, by its willingness to look the other way as long as itтАЩs somebodyтАЩs elseтАЩs parents, elders, siblings, kids who are dying of this disease. Look anywhere and you see the blight on AmericaтАЩs tree of life: rising hate violence and paramilitary activity, mass incarceration and failed community safety systems, public health disparities and life expectancy determined by zip code. The number of white people moved to action by George FloydтАЩs murder shows the extent of the moral injury inflicted on all of America by the inhumanity of racist violence and structural inequality. Independence Day is a good day to recognize that the war on Black America is a war on all of America. White supremacy has created the conditions weтАЩre protesting now. White nationalism тАФ which seeks to create a white ethno-state тАФ exploits those conditions and endangers democracy for all. Take TrumpтАЩs attempts to distract the nation from his failed COVID-19 response. He tried accusing the тАЬfake newsтАЭ media of exaggerating the virus. He tried scapegoating China, fanning the flames of anti-Asian violence. He retweeted conspiracy theories based in antisemitism. And he unleashed armed paramilitaries to shut down state capitols. When the air went out of all of that, Trump needed a fresh target to shift the focus off his failures. He turned his attention to an old standby: demonizing Black America. This was before the current uprising in response to police brutality began. The easiest weapon in TrumpтАЩs base-building arsenal: attacking former President Obama. His trumped-up and immediately dismissed charges of тАЬObamagateтАЭ were all about reigniting ObamaHate. ItтАЩs no surprise that Trump would seek to make a war on Obama a key front in his effort to shore up his popularity. Blowing the dog-whistle of racism on Obama is a big part of what made Trump who he is today. His flagrant flying of the racist тАЬbirtherтАЭ flag began in 2011 and continued deep into his presidential campaign in 2016. Just as Trump vilifies philanthropist George Soros as a way to tap into AmericaтАЩs unconscious antisemitism, he tested the notion of Obamagate to activate the racism that fuels ObamaHate. Just as his vilification of China created violent conditions for Asian Americans, his vilification of Obama set the stage for how law enforcement responded to Black protest just a few weeks later. With Trump increasingly desperate to stem his deteriorating popularity and the Movement for Black Lives advancing moral gains, Black America needs to get ready. Despite the robust movement in support of Black lives in the streets right now, we need to understand that the white nationalist movement is undeterred. White nationalism puts us at risk of losing everything our parents, grandparents, and their grandparents fought to win. Our ancestors built this country. Our people have always been central to upholding American ideals, challenging America to be its best self. We have spent generations defeating hate violence, from the Confederacy to Jim Crow. We cannot allow centuries of Black American sacrifice to die in the coming backlash. Black American resistance is the best of American patriotism. Black American patriotism builds broad-based multi-racial alliances while being clear about the special position that Black and Indigenous people hold тАФ the faces at the bottom of the well, as Dr. Derrick Bell described us. Black American patriotism recognizes that we are not just the experiential experts on hate violence and white supremacy; we are the community experts on resisting the authoritarianism that underlies the war on Black America. Black American patriotism calls us to strengthen our understanding of authoritarian and anti-democratic movements inside our community and to close the door on xenophobia, antisemitism, Islamophobia, misogyny and homophobia and transphobia. Black American patriotism is the optimism that inclusive community is possible. Black American patriotism understands the value of lifting one another up, of prioritizing the dreams of all of AmericaтАЩs children. The America we have always fought for is an America that knows how to say itтАЩs sorry, to keep long-forgotten promises. ThatтАЩs committed to repairing the harms done to one another and the land that nurtures us all. ThatтАЩs the America we are fighting for today. ItтАЩs not just about toppling statues and defunding policing systems. ItтАЩs about what replaces them. Truth. Reconciliation. Liberty and justice not for some, but for all. We recognize how much you have accomplished, Black America, and the cost incurred, over the past four years, and in particular the last few months. We salute you, Black America, for how far you have brought this country forward. Black American patriots are building a 21st century civil rights movement, just like we built the civil rights movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. A 21st century civil rights movement in which America fully reckons with its original sins. A movement to liberate AmericaтАЩs humanity and free up inclusive democracy from the bonds of white nationalism. We can do this. Happy Independence Day. ItтАЩs time for us to take our flag back.

9079,,"Guidance for the Brookings community and the public on our response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) ┬╗ Learn more from Brookings scholars about the global response to coronavirus (COVID-19) ┬╗ President-elect Joe Biden should hold a special virtual inauguration for the cities of Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Detroit. These metro areas including their sprawling suburbs helped to mount political theater equivalent to the New England Patriots comeback win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. This time, however, AtlantaтАЩs mail-in ballots came back to win GeorgiaтАЩs electoral votes for Biden similar to how Philadelphia did for Pennsylvania and Detroit did for Michigan. Exit poll data from the 2020 election show the power of the Black vote. Black Americans represented over 50% of all Democratic voters in Georgia (33% of state population is Black), 20% of all Democratic voters in Michigan (14% of state population is Black), and 21% of all Democratic voters in Pennsylvania (12% of state population). These percentages are considering the critique of exit polls for failure to properly account for the various ways that diverse groups from Blacks to rural whites engage in the political process and respond to surveys. And, 2020 is not an anomaly. Black voters have long pulled their weight relative to other racial groups. if ( ! document.getElementById( 'simplechart-widget-js' ) ) { window.__simplechart_public_path__ = window.__simplechart_public_path__ || """"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/wp-content\/plugins\/wordpress-simplechart\/js\/app\/""""; }   In most battleground states, a majority of Black Americans live in metro areas. In Pennsylvania, 65% of Black people live in Philadelphia and nearly 15% in Pittsburgh. Over 70% of Black people live in the Detroit area as well as the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, area. In Arizona, nearly 85% live in Phoenix. In Georgia, 60% live in Atlanta and 35% in Augusta. But, the sprawling suburbs in these areas also show the power of the Black vote. Considering Georgia went blue for the first time in 28 years, it is an ideal example. Using American Community Survey estimates, roughly the same percentage of Blacks and whites (44%) live in Fulton County, which is the county where Atlanta is located. However, the past decade has witnessed a decrease in the white population and an increase in the Black population in most counties that border Fulton. In neighboring Cobb County, the Black population increased from 25% to 28% from 2010-2019, while the white population decreased from 62% to 56% (and only 51% if considering non-Hispanic whites). In Gwinnett County, the Black population increased from 24% to 28% from 2010-2019, while the white population decreased from 54% to 46%. Clayton CountyтАЩs Black population increased from 66% to 70%, while the white population decreased from 20% to 17%. Even counties with smaller Black populations and larger white populations like Cherokee and Forsyth counties show a similar pattern. The small exception is DeKalb County (where I lived during elementary school). The county had stability in the Black population over the past decade (roughly 54%), while the white population slightly increased from 33% to 34% (29% for non-Hispanic whites). if ( ! document.getElementById( 'simplechart-widget-js' ) ) { window.__simplechart_public_path__ = window.__simplechart_public_path__ || """"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/wp-content\/plugins\/wordpress-simplechart\/js\/app\/""""; }   Exit poll data further suggests that college-educated whites did not overwhelmingly vote for Biden in Georgia. In fact, less than 40% voted for Biden compared to 60% voting for Trump. Besides Alabama and South Carolina, this was the lowest percentage of college-educated whites voting for Biden in battleground states. Comparatively, over 50% of college-educated whites voted for Biden in Michigan and Pennsylvania. While some political pundits and journalists attributed Georgia going Democrat to white suburbs, Black voters were the real key. Accordingly, it is important to compare the political context of the 2020 presidential election with that of 1992. Biden reported decided to run for president upon hearing Donald TrumpтАЩs failure to admonish white nationalists and white supremacists who held a тАЬUnite the RightтАЭ rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 where they enacted violence and murdered Heather Heyer, a counter-protester and Black Lives Matter supporter. We must juxtapose BidenтАЩs electoral decision with former President Bill Clinton who launched his тАЬtough on crimeтАЭ campaign at Stone Mountain Correctional Facility with mostly incarcerated Black men standing behind him in single-file lines. Interestingly, ClintonтАЩs speech helped galvanize Georgia voters to support him and helped the Arkansas-native to flip the state blue. His speech also helped galvanize the 1994 crime bill, which ironically was shepherded by Biden and blamed for contributing to mass incarceration. Though Biden is forming the most racially diverse cabinet in American history and has made clear through his actions and words that addressing systemic racism will be a focal point of his administration, it is clear that he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have considerable work to do on criminal justice reform. But the role of Black Americans goes way beyond helping candidate Biden secure a presidential victory. With TrumpтАЩs divisive rhetoric, overt appeals to systemic racism, use of outright falsehoods and distortions, and attempt to overturn the 2020 election through extra-legal maneuvers, Blacks helped to save American democracy. They enabled Democrats to overcome the appeals of a GOP leader intent on subverting long-held democratic institutions and ushering in an era of authoritarian rule. A second Trump term likely would have featured more catastrophic attacks on the opposition, including delegitimizing civil society organizations and packing the judiciary with loyalists. Eight years of Trump rule would have destroyed American democracy and altered the future of the country and the world. Growing up in the Atlanta-metro area, I know the legacy and current realities of voter suppression, police brutality, racial segregation, and white supremacy. I share a collective memory with other Blacks of electoral tactics that kept the Black vote down and prevented Stacey Abrams from becoming governor just two years ago. As a kid, I remember visiting Stone Mountain for Fourth of July and witnessing the most amazing laser light display that I have ever seen. As I got older, I realized that the light show was celebrating Confederate generals who aimed to keep my ancestors on plantations and in convict leasing shackles. This is why the political mobilization of Stacey Abrams, civic organizations, and Black Lives Matter activists is so remarkable, both for the 2020 election and American democracy. It is clear rallying cries about systemic racism and a potentially better and more equitable America were heard loud and clear by many voters. According to a CNN exit poll, 36% of Democratic voters ranked racial inequality as their number one issue followed by coronavirus at 27%, two issues that deeply affect Black Americans. Conversely, only 3% of Republican voters ranked racial inequality as their top choice and only 5% ranked coronavirus. Georgia Democratic Senate Candidate Reverend Raphael Warnock, pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.тАЩs historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, received the most votes in a crowded Senate race and will face Republican Kelly Loeffler on Jan. 5, 2021 in a runoff. The other Senate runoff will put Democrat Jon Ossoff against Republican David Perdue. Similar to the estimated 9 million people who watched the Verzuz battle between rappers Jeezy and Gucci Mane, all eyes will once again be on Georgia as the fate of the Senate likely will come down to the power of Black voters.",1,3,1,3

9744,"Black Americans: No Longer """"Useful Tools"""" For the Leftist, Hate-America Agenda by Walter Williams | Capitalism Magazine","by Walter Williams | Nov 2, 2020 | CULTURE I was a teenager, growing up in the Richard Allen housing project of North Philadelphia, when Emmett Till was lynched in Money, Mississippi, on Aug. 28, 1955, and his brutalized, unrecognizable body later recovered from the Tallahatchie River. From 1882-1968, 4,743 lynchings occurred in the United States. Roughly 73%, or 3,446, were black people, and 27%, or 1,297, were white people. Many whites were lynched because they were Republicans who supported their fellow black citizens and opposed the lawless act of lynching. Tuskegee University has the best documentation of lynching. It records an 1892 high of 69 whites and 161 blacks lynched. By the 1940s, occurrences of lynching fell to single digits or disappeared altogether. At the time of my youth, todayтАЩs opportunities for socioeconomic advancement were nonexistent for black people. For all but a few, college attendance was out of the question because of finances and racial discrimination. If you were not admitted to the black colleges of Lincoln University or Cheyney State College, forget about college. I do not know of any student of my 1954 class at PhiladelphiaтАЩs Benjamin Franklin High School who attended college. Though the quality of education at Benjamin Franklin is a mere shadow of its past, today roughly 17% of its graduating class has been admitted to college. The true hope for a youngster graduating from high school during the 1950s was a well-paying and steady job. My first well-paying job was as a taxi driver for Yellow Cab Company. Younger black people today have no idea of and have not experienced the poverty and discrimination of earlier generations. Also, the problems todayтАЩs black people face have little or nothing to do with poverty and discrimination. Political hustlers like to blame poverty and racism while ignoring the fact that poverty and racism were much greater yesteryear but there was not nearly the same amount of chaos. The out-of-wedlock birth rate among blacks in 1940 was about 11%; today, it is 75%. Black female-headed households were just 18% of households in 1950, as opposed to about 68% today. In fact, from 1890 to 1940, the black marriage rate was slightly higher than that of whites. Even during slavery, when marriage was forbidden, most black children lived in biological two-parent families. In New York City, in 1925, 85% of black households were two-parent households. A study of 1880 family structure in Philadelphia shows that three-quarters of black families were two-parent households. ThereтАЩs little protest against the horrible and dangerous conditions under which many poor and law-abiding black people must live. It is not uncommon for 50 black people to be shot over a weekend in Chicago тАФ not by policemen but by other black people. About 7,300 black people are murdered each year, and not by white people or racist cops, but mostly by other black people. These numbers almost make our history of victimization by racist lynching look like childтАЩs play. The solutions to the many problems that black Americans face must come from within our black communities. They will not come from the political arena. Blacks hold high offices and dominate the politics in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans. Yet, these are the very cities with the nationтАЩs worst-performing schools, highest crime rates, high illegitimacy rates, weak family structure and other forms of social pathology. I am not saying that blacks having political power is the cause of these problems. What I am saying is that the solution to most of the major problems that confront black people will not be found in the political arena or by electing more blacks to high office. One important step is for black Americans to stop being тАЬuseful toolsтАЭ for the leftist, hate-America agenda. Many black problems are exacerbated by guilt-ridden white people. Often, they accept behavior and standards from black people that they would not begin to accept from white people. In that sense, white liberal guilt is a form of disrespect in their relationships with black Americans. By the same token, black people should stop exploiting the guilt of whites.

6865,Florida Teacher Writes Her Own Obituary To Protest Reopening Schools Amid COVID-19,"A Florida teacher responded to her districtтАЩs plans to reopen for in-person classes during the coronavirus pandemic by writing her own obituary. Whitney Reddick, who teaches special education in Jacksonville, Florida, posted the mock death notice to Facebook Aug. 4. In it, she proclaims that she died тАЬwhile alone in isolation and on a ventilator at a Duval county hospitalтАЭ last week at age 33. тАЬEven though she shouted from the rooftops, attempted to be unemotional, and educated herself in facts and science, she succumbed to the ignorance of those in power,тАЭ the obituary reads. тАЬShe returned to work, did her best to handle all the roles placed on her shoulders; educator, COVID-security guard, human shield, firefighter, social worker, nurse, and caregiver but the workload weakened her, and the virus took hold.тАЭ тАЬWhitney was taken from us,тАЭ it continues. тАЬYes, of course too soon, but we are the ones left with holes in our hearts, missing how big hers was.тАЭ Mourners are then encouraged to send тАЬcondolencesтАЭ to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) and the Duval County school board and superintendent. According to its website, Duval County public schools are slated to reopen next Thursday with both in-person and remote learning options for students. Though Reddick said in an interview sheтАЩll return to her classroom as scheduled, she added that sheтАЩd prefer her district keep classes for all students remote, given that coronavirus cases in Florida continue to surge. тАЬI felt the gravity of the situation and the obit took that on,тАЭ she told тАЬThe Today ShowтАЭ last week. She said that in the debate over reopening schools, educators тАЬno longer became people who had families and loved ones, we became a tool in restarting an economy. I wanted it to hit home that teachers are people and have families and loved ones.тАЭ And Reddick, the mother of a 1-year-old boy, said sheтАЩs mostly concerned about what would happen to her family if she were to contract COVID-19. тАЬI love my job so much,тАЭ she told CBS Jacksonville. тАЬWhat if I go on a ventilator? What if my husband gets sick? ... Who takes care of our son? What if I pass away? What if he passes away?тАЭ In an email, Duval County Superintendent Diana Greene told HuffPost she and her staff planned to тАЬrise to the challengeтАЭ of teaching amid the pandemic. тАЬTeaching is a public service, but it is unlikely any of us thought about a long-term global pandemic when we chose this path to serve children,тАЭ she said. тАЬI empathize with the fears some teachers have expressed, and I also empathize with the needs of 130,000 children and their families.тАЭ тАЬWith the resources and guidance available to us, we must move forward with every feasible precaution to support our employees and to serve those students who need us in classrooms,тАЭ she added. As of Thursday, more than 550,901 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Florida. The state had a testing positivity rate of 13.45%, according to Johns Hopkins University. The universityтАЩs statistics on Thursday showed almost 9,000 deaths in Florida attributed to the coronavirus, fifth-most in the U.S.",1,1,0,0
6870,"Man shot dead during BLM protests is seen on video taunting armed men and saying 'Shoot me, n*****'","By Ariel Zilber and Rachel Sharp For Dailymail.com and Associated Press Published: 08:48 EDT, 29 August 2020 | Updated: 12:00 EDT, 29 August 2020  1.1k View comments  One of the two protesters fatally shot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night by a 17-year-old vigilante gunman from Illinois was filmed taunting a group of armed individuals moments before he was killed. тАШShoot me, n*****,тАЩ 36-year-old Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men during the unrest that followed last Sunday's police shooting of 29-year-old black man Jacob Blake. One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum. He then walks past Rosenbaum without incident. Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, has been charged with fatally shooting Rosenbaum and 26-year-old Anthony Huber and wounding a third - Gaige Grosskreutz, 26. Rittenhouse shot one of his victims five times including in the head, the criminal complaint reveals - but his attorney has claimed it was he who was 'attacked' and insisted he was acting in self-defense. Rittenhouse's attorney Lin Wood said the 17-year-old vigilante was 'attacked' with 'lethal force' and 'had the right to defend himself' when he shot dead the two Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man, Grosskreutz. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, one of two people killed during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, was filmed shortly before his death taunting a group of armed individuals. Rosenbaum is seen on the right in the reddish-brown t-shirt тАШShoot me, n*****,тАЩ the 36-year-old Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap (left) and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum Attorneys representing Rittenhouse have said he acted to defend himself. Kenosha County prosecutors said in court records this week that Rosenbaum was the first person Rittenhouse shot at around 11:45pm on Tuesday. Prosecutors said Rosenbaum followed Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him. The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin, back and left hand. The wounds fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead. The two men who were killed were Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, (left) and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, (right) about 15 miles west of the city. Huber's devastated girlfriend broke her silence over his 'murder' Friday, saying her 'heroic' boyfriend died trying to save the lives of her and other protesters Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, pictured with his fianc├йe and a young daughter, died Tuesday evening Gaige Grosskreutz (left) - the suspected killer's third and only surviving victim is pictured in hospital recovering after the shooting. On right is his left arm where he was shot Grosskreutz pictured clutching his bloodied arm after Rittenhouse shot him at close range Tuesday night Grosskreutz getting medical attention after the shooting. Grosskreutz, aged 26, was legally permitted to be carrying his handgun. Rittenhouse meanwhile is 17 and so was illegally carrying the AR-15 rifle he used to shoot Grosskreutz and the two other victims Friends have told local media that Rosenbaum was originally from Texas and previously lived in Arizona before moving to Wisconsin this year, where his young daughter lives. According to his Facebook page, he worked at a Wendy's restaurant in Kenosha. Rosenbaum is survived by a fiancee and a young daughter. тАШMay you forever be with the angels and rest easy bro. I love you!тАЩ his sister wrote on Facebook. After shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone, before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and video footage. Huber, of Silver Lake, Wisconsin, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrestle the gun away from Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Hannah Gittings, Huber's girlfriend, told WBBM-TV that he pushed her out of the way before chasing after the man others on the street had identified as the shooter. HuberтАЩs friends gathered at a Kenosha skate park this week to remember him and his passion for skateboarding. According to court records, Huber had a skateboard in his right hand and used it to тАШmake contactтАЩ with RittenhouseтАЩs left shoulder as they struggled for control of the gun. Other protesters remembered Huber on Wednesday night near the spot where he was shot, and Gittings told the group that he was an amazing person. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, has been charged with first degree intentional homicide following the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha on Tuesday. Social media photos show the teen had a strong admiration for law enforcement and guns Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter - the movement that supports police. He also previously participated in a youth public safety cadet program (pictured), according to social media тАШHe took down an armed gunman with nothing but his (profanity) skateboard,тАЩ Gittings said, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Kenosha News reported that local protest organizers said both Rosenbaum and Huber had participated in demonstrations this spring and summer, beginning with the May death of George Floyd after a Minnesota police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed man's neck. тАШThey came out here every time with us,тАЩ said Porche Bennett, a Kenosha resident who has organized protests. тАШSweet. Loving. They were the sweetest hearts, souls. I called Anthony my hippie guy. They were sweet guys.тАЩ Bennett said she was particularly grateful to Huber, who stood in front of her when authorities used tear gas during protests outside the Kenosha County Courthouse this week. According to court records, Huber has a criminal record that includes several arrests for battery, drugs and other charges. At the time of his death, Rosenbaum had an open criminal case on battery, disorderly conduct and domestic abuse charges. The third man to be shot was wounded in the left arm. Court records said Grosskreutz appeared to be holding a gun when he approached Rittenhouse after he shot at Huber. Grosskreutz is an activist who volunteered as a medic during the Kenosha demonstrations, according to Milwaukee activist Bethany Crevensten. Jacob Blake (pictured) was shot seven times in the back by a cop in front of his three young children Sunday. Outrage is building over the cops' response to white teen Rittenhouse compared to black man Blake The image above shows the moment a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer fired at least seven shots into the back of Jacob Blake as he was getting into an SUV in a residential neighborhood The images above show the moments leading up to the shooting. Blake (seen in the white shirt) walks away from a police officer who has his gun drawn She said Grosskreutz was part of a group of roughly two dozen activists who have demonstrated around Milwaukee in the wake of FloydтАЩs death and went to Kenosha to protest. Grosskreutz, who was wearing a backpack and cap labeled тАШparamedic,тАЩ was shot in the arm, Crevensten said. тАШHe was a hero and he is a hero,тАЩ she said. Grosskreutz, of West Allis, was recovering after surgery and was not yet giving interviews, Crevensten said this week. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Grosskreutz is a senior at Northland College in Ashland and the college registrar's office said he is set to graduate in December. Kyle Rittenhouse's (pictured Tuesday night) attorney has claimed he was 'attacked' and was acting in self-defense when he shot dead two unarmed Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man in the streets of Kenosha Tuesday night, as new video reveals a different angle to one of the attacks The video shows the vigilante shooting his third and only surviving victim Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm as the 26-year-old was carrying a handgun. This came moments after Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, and called a friend to say 'I've killed someone' Grosskreutz is armed with a handgun in his right hand and appears to come towards Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse opens fire at Grosskreutz at close range shooting him in the left arm. Wisconsin is an open carry state, meaning people aged 18 and over are legally allowed to carry a gun. Grosskreutz is over 18, Rittenhouse is not A grab of Rittenhouse's extradition hearing on Friday morning. He did not show his face The paper also reported that he previously worked as a special events coordinator, wilderness medical instructor and sea kayak guide at Lost Creek Adventures in Cornucopia, according to an online LinkedIn profile. The company offers kayak tours, rentals and programs on wilderness skills within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Rittenhouse, a police-obsessed Donald Trump supporter, appeared before a judge briefly on a Zoom call on Friday. His extradition hearing has been pushed back another month. He will return to court on September 25. The teen is faced with murder charges while outrage builds nationwide over the different treatment by cops of the white armed teen compared to their treatment of Blake. Rittenhouse faces five felony charges that include first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, and a misdemeanor charge for possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.

Our editorial content is not influenced by any commissions we receive. ┬й Complex Media, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Complex.com is a part of Find him on Twitter. Share This Story Amnesty International is urging law enforcement to reform its policing policies, after identifying 125 human rights violations during the Black Lives Matter protests. On Tuesday, the organization released a report in which it documented alleged abuses committed by federal, state, and local police officers between May 26 and June 5 across 40 states. After analyzing police responses to the demonstrations sparked by George Floyd's death, Amnesty concluded that law enforcement had violated people's rights to peaceful assembly through the use of intimidation and violence. The organization specifically noted the use of tear gas, smoke, and percussion grenades, which were not only used against protestors, but also bystanders and journalists. Per the report: Using heavy-duty riot gear and military-grade weapons and equipment to police largely peaceful demonstrations intimidates protesters exercising their right to peaceful assembly. Equipping officers in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable rather than possible and may escalate tensions between protesters and police ... As seen in many countries, inappropriate or excessive police interventions can actually lead to violence and disorder rather than reducing tensions. Indeed, police will have a propensity to use the weaponry they are deployed with and so should not be deployed with weapons that are inherently inappropriate for the operation they are conducting. Amnesty also launched an interactive map that marked instances of police violence during the demonstrations. The map was a result of an extensive investigation that included the analysis of 500 videos and photos posted on social media as well as consultation with weapons and law enforcement experts. In some of these cases, Amnesty was able to interview the victims and confirm police conduct with local authorities. Related Stories STORY CONTINUES BELOW """"The analysis is clear: When activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets in cities and towns across the USA to peacefully demand an end to systemic racism and police violence, they were overwhelmingly met with a militarized response and more police violence,"""" said Brian Castner, senior crisis advisor on Arms and Military Operations at Amnesty International. """"The time for applying band-aids and making excuses for a few тАШbad applesтАЩ has passed."""" Amnesty is calling on federal, state, and local officials to make sweeping changes to the way law enforcement responds to protests. The organization has urged lawmakers to limit the use of lethal force and """"ensure that everyone under their jurisdiction can enjoy their human rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression."""" Amnesty has also demanded each law enforcement agency to revise the policing policies in accordance with international human rights standards, including those laid out in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials.

6915,Trump furious that he can't do rallies in Florida after its GOP governor made COVID spread 'worse': report,"President Donald Trump is reportedly furious at one of his allies for taking his advice. According to Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman, the president is angry that he can't hold any of his trademark campaign rallies in Florida amid its weeks-long surge in COVID-19 cases. What's more, Sherman's sources say Trump is putting the blame for this predicament at the feet of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been eager to follow the president's commands to reopen state economies even as the country records more than 50,000 infections and 1,000 new deaths from the novel coronavirus every day. """"He thinks Ron has made it a lot worse,"""" one Republican who spoke with Trump said. Trump was forced to cancel his planned RNC acceptance speech in Jacksonville after public health officials told him there was no way to safely hold a mass gathering in the city without risking mass COVID-19 infection. Nonetheless, one aide tells Sherman that """"rallies are his jam"""" and that """"Trump wonтАЩt be happy until he is doing multiple rallies a day."""" The novel coronavirus crisis in Florida continues to grow more and more dire. As flagged by Bloomberg News' Steven Dennis, Florida has once again smashed its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations and now has 15,169 residents hospitalized with the disease. Even more alarming is the fact that nearly 47 percent of all intensive care unit beds in the state are being taken up by COVID-19 patients, which Dennis says is the highest percentage in the nation right now. The latest numbers mark a major jump from just two days ago, when Florida reported having 13,793 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has so far completely refused to enact any measures that could possibly slow down the spread of the disease and has even threatened to withhold pay from school administrators who want to implement mask mandates for students and faculty. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has similarly banned school districts from enforcing mask or vaccination requirements, is now asking hospitals to postpone all elective surgeries while he looks for out-of-state health workers who can help his state cope with the deadly pandemic. Earth has warmed 1.09тДГ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report also found escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth, and every facet of the weather. The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November. The IPCC is the peak climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. It is the global authority on the state of Earth's climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment. Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today. But there is still time to avert the worst damage, if humanity chooses to.  For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally тАФ leaving absolutely no room for doubt тАУ humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans. The IPCC finds Earth's global surface temperature warmed 1.09тДГ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29тДГ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1тДГ of the increase is due to data improvements.) Read more: Monday's IPCC report is a really big deal for climate change. So what is it? And why should we trust it? Trump-loving podcaster and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Tuesday said that America's founders would have launched a military strike against """"Drag Queen Story Hour"""" events if such things existed in the late 18th century. In his podcast, Kirk sought to dispel what he called """"lies"""" about America's founders and their tolerance for what Kirk considers to be sexual deviancy. """"One of the lies about the founding fathers is that they were strictly small-l libertarians,"""" he said. """"And that's just not true... For example, let me just tell you this: If Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, or John Adams saw drag queen story hour, they would mobilize the Minutemen."""" It is unclear what about transgender people reading stories to children would require a military response, but Kirk insisted that such an attack would have been within the framers' conception of human liberty.

6924,Portland Police Precinct Set On Fire As Protests and Riots Intensify,"Demonstrators set a Portland, Oregon, police precinct on fire Sunday evening as the event was declared a riot by the law enforcement agency. On Monday morning, the Portland Police Department released a statement along with footage of the unrest that erupted several hours prior. According to the police departmentтАЩs statement, a crowd of approximately 200 protesters gathered in the streets of Portland late Sunday evening at around 9:41 p.m. Shortly after the gathering began, it intensified to protests, and тАЬsomeone lit a canopy against the building on fire.тАЭ The law enforcement agency detailed how the fire erupted. тАЬThe fire began to burn to the siding of the building, so officers on the roof got a fire extinguisher to try and put it out. As they were putting out the fire, multiple people pelted the officers with rocks,тАЭ the statement read. тАЬA lieutenant was struck with a chunk of ceramic, causing a cut to his hand. A second awning was also lit on fire close to a tree. That caused damage before it was extinguished.тАЭ  Amid the precinct fire, the police department detailed a number of other incidents that occurred on Sunday evening. According to the department, the majority of participants wore тАЬarmor, helmets, gas masks, all-black clothing, and carried shields.тАЭ The statement also indicated that the riot began when a dumpster was set on fire and pushed into an intersection. Law enforcement officials also claim the burning dumpster was used to shield to protect rioters as they hurled multiple objects at officers including: тАЬAlmost immediately, from behind the shields and elsewhere, individuals began throwing chunks of ceramic, rocks, and glass bottles in the direction of the officers. Green lasers, which are capable of causing permanent eye damage, were shined at officers. At least one balloon filled with feces was thrown at officers on the roof of the building.тАЭ At one point, a commercial-grade firework, paint bombs, rocks and even тАЬmarbles were launched by at least one wrist rocket style slingshot,тАЭ according to the police department. As a result of the fire, тАЬTwo North Precinct awnings were lit on fire, and officers were targeted by protesters with sharp chunks of ceramic, rocks, mortars, and powerful lasers during a riot Sunday evening into Monday morning.тАЭ We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

6961,Thousands of people protest after Lukashenko landslide win in Belarus election,"Authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko has won another term - but there are concerns that the election was not run fairly. Monday 10 August 2020 10:24, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Police and protesters have clashed in the capital of Belarus and other cities after a contested presidential election which saw the country's long-time leader secure a landslide victory. Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, won the election with 80% of the vote, the election commission said - according to preliminary results. However, there is widespread suspicion that the election was not fair, with two opposition candidates denied places on the ballot before one of them was jailed and the other fled to Russia.  On Monday morning Reuters reported that at least one person was killed and 120 protesters had been detained, citing the Viasna human rights group. Many were injured in clashes with riot police who were deployed on the streets to disperse protesters. """"It was a peaceful protest, we weren't using force,"""" said 23-year-old protester Pavel Konoplyanik, helping a friend to hospital who had a plastic grenade fragment stuck in his neck. """"No one will believe in the official results of the vote, they have stolen our victory."""" The main opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was targeted during the weekend: eight members of her staff were arrested and one of her aides fled the country. Ms Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher and wife of a jailed opposition blogger, had received large displays of support leading up to the election - unusual in a country where dissent is rarely tolerated. But opposition supporters said they expected election officials would manipulate the election results in favour of Mr Lukashenko. After the vote on Sunday, thousands of protesters gathered in Minsk where police used truncheons to beat them and flash-bang grenades in an effort to get them to leave. Protesters tried to build barricades with rubbish bins. There were also demonstrations in the cities of Brest, Gomel, Grodno and Vitebsk and police fired tear gas at people in Brest, according to news reports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is unclear how many people were injured or arrested but the Association Press quoted Ales Bilyatsky of Viasna as saying there had been several hundred arrests. Among them were three journalists from an independent Russian TV station and an AP journalist was beaten by police and taken to hospital. But for some voters, Lukashenko's long, hard-line rule was a plus. """"He is an experienced politician, not a housewife who appeared out of nowhere and muddied the waters,"""" said retiree Igor Rozhov. """"We need a strong hand that will not allow riots."""" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, Ms Tsikhanouskaya said she did not believe the polls, saying: """"I will believe with my own eyes. The majority was for us."""" After voting earlier in the day, she had said: """"I hope that everything will be peaceful and that the police will not use force."""" As he voted, Mr Lukashenko had said: """"Do you want to try to overthrow the government, break something, wound, offend, and expect me or someone to kneel in front of you and kiss them and the sand onto which you wandered? This will not happen."""" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mr Lukashenko has been in power since July 1994 but many have become frustrated with his authoritarian rule, the struggling economy and his failure to recognise the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. He has dismissed the illness as """"psychosis"""" and advised people to """"drink vodka"""" and """"go to saunas"""" to ward off the virus. Two weeks ago, the 65-year-old said he had caught COVID-19 and recovered """"on his feet"""" without showing any symptoms.  He has not brought in any restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, despite more than 68,500 confirmed cases and 580 deaths - numbers that critics say are manipulated.

Demonstrators ignore hygiene rules to rally in German capital. Thousands of people, packed close together and not wearing face masks, protested in Berlin on Saturday against official measures intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Police said they would file charges against the organizer of the gathering as demonstrators had not followed hygiene rules such as maintaining social distancing or wearing a mask covering nose and mouth. Some 17,000 people took part in the demonstration at its peak, according to police. The gathering was organized with the title """"The end of the pandemic тАФ day of freedom."""" Some demonstrators chanted """"the biggest conspiracy theory is the pandemic,"""" according to German media reports. A Stuttgart-based organization called Querdenken 711 тАФ which roughly translates as """"thinking outside the box 711"""" тАФ organized the rally. The interior minister for the city of Berlin, Andreas Geisel, said on Friday that neo-Nazi organizations had also called for people to participate in the march. German media outlets noted that """"Day of Freedom"""" was also the name of a Nazi propaganda film documenting the party's 1935 party congress in Nuremberg. One banner at the march called for politicians such as German Health Minister Jens Spahn, Bavaria's state premier Markus S├╢der, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leading virologist Christian Drosten to be """"locked away."""" Protesters also """"aggressively asked"""" journalists to remove their masks by protestors, newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported.

7033,"Thousands protest in Mauritius over dead dolphins, demand resignations","Discover Thomson Reuters By Giulia Paravicini 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in the Mauritius capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into an oil spill from a Japanese ship and the mysterious death of at least 40 dolphins that have been found near the site of the spill. Environmentalists have called for an investigation into whether the dolphins died as a result of the spill caused when the bulk carrier, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. One protestor held a banner with a dolphin covered in oil reading тАЬour lives matterтАЭ and another held one calling for the government to resign. Mauritian flags were waved across the packed square of St Louis Cathedral. тАЬWe do not trust the government and the diluted information theyтАЩve been feeding us regarding the management and responses to the oil spill,тАЭ Fabiola Monty, 33 a Mauritian environmental scientist, told Reuters from the square. The government has said it will carry out autopsies on all the dead dolphins and has set up a commission to look into the oil spill. Two investigations are being carried out: one by the police on the crewтАЩs responsibilities and one by a senior Shipping Ministry official on what happened to the ship. So far veterinarians have examined only two of the mammalsтАЩ carcasses, which bore signs of injury but no trace of oil in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, according to Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry. Local environmental group Eco-Sud, which took part in SaturdayтАЩs protest, said in a statement on Friday that representatives from civil society should be present during the autopsies and called for a second opinion from independent specialists.

Older adults are typically more prone to severe coronavirus infections, although individuals with weakened immune systems are also at high risk. The demonstrators have a list of demands corresponding to the protest, including petitions for more COVID-19 testing and offering faculty members the liberty to teach remotely. Currently, faculty must seek permission from the school to teach remote online courses. The group submitted a petition with 1,002 signatures along with the list of demands to an employee in the administration building. Graduate student Bryant Barnes said the school's current testing plans would not be enough to accommodate consistently testing all students and employees. Sujata Iyengar, a professor at the school since 1998 who joined protesters, said she thinks university officials """"have not thought this through,"""" adding that more classes should be held outside rather than indoors, where the virus spreads more easily.

7097,Protests Not Allowed On Mayor's Street (Yet City Can Suffer),"PROTESTS NOT ALLOWED: The Chicago Police Department has banned protests near Mayor Lori LightfootтАЩs home. REASON: In July protesters rallied near the MayorтАЩs residence and due to threats she reportedly receives daily, heightened security was put in place. WHY ITтАЩS HYPOCRITICAL: Protests have been allowed to dominate business and residential areas since May. Vandalism of property, arson, blockades, looting, violence, and organized acts of terrorism have all been watched by certain Democrat officials. Often supported without condemnation. Now that the wildfires of anarchy are seemingly uncontrollable, officials that could have and should have stopped it earlier are protected. Yet businesses, properties, and peopleтАЩs daily lives continue to suffer. BANNED: WhatтАЩs most hypocritical is that according to a report, not even peaceful protests are allowed near the MayorтАЩs home. CHECK OUT: Watch the Portland Mayor protected by private security after the anarchists he stood with surge and get aggressive. Back in July, a report surfaced saying that the police had banned protests from the Logan Square neighborhood, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot lives. It referred to a directive from Melvin Roman, the Shakespeare District Commander, written to officers under his command. It stated that once the order to move was given by police officers, any protesters who remained should be arrested. The directive did not differentiate between peaceful or violent protests. The Mayor should just put signs up saying тАЬProtests Not Allowed.тАЭ CHECK OUT: Mayor on the hunt for criminal mastermind who wrote hate speech on a road sign. The sign read тАЬAll Lives Matter.тАЭ Both the Mayor and Police Chief apologized for the act. Some might say that this move by the Mayor and Chicago Police Department is against the First Amendment, it isnтАЩt. It only seems that way because of the chaos, violence, and ignorance shown by some elected officials. By law, officials can define times and places protests take place. If done so neutrally and reasonably. However, the keyword is peaceful. A violent protest is not legal. CHECK OUT: Child shot by anarchists, at an anarchist barrier that a Mayor was negotiating over. Subscribe: Apple / Google / Spotify / Stitcher / RSS Mayor Lori Lightfoot said: тАЬI think that residents of this city, understanding the nature of the threats that we are receiving on a daily basis, on a daily basis, understand I have a right to make sure that my home is secure.тАЭ If only every resident of Chicago could use taxpayerтАЩs money to make sure their homes, businesses, and property were secure. She continued: тАЬIтАЩm not going to make any excuses for the fact that, given the threats I have personally received, given the threats to my home and my family, IтАЩm going to do everything I can to make sure theyтАЩre protected. I make no apologies whatsoever for that.тАЭ Remember, this is the Mayor who while the rest of Chicago was in lockdown, was out getting her hair done. It is pure hypocrisy. CHECK OUT: Mayor Lori Lightfoot defied lockdown rules to get hair done uses mob-like tactics to keep churches following the same orders she broke. Share:",1,3,0,0

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler took aim Wednesday at what he called тАЬa few dozen individuals engaged in violenceтАЭ who he said have allowed the Oregon city to be wrongly portrayed as a тАЬdark dystopiaтАЭ by President Trump and others. Mr. Wheeler took some of the blame himself, saying he and other leaders have allowed the cityтАЩs reputation for protest to be hijacked by rioters bent on violence, swamping what should have been a thoughtful conversation on racial justice and policing. тАЬTheyтАЩre intent on creating mayhem and attacking and harming people, not just property,тАЭ the mayor said in an online press conference Wednesday night. тАЬThatтАЩs a line that we canтАЩt allow our community to cross. Not anymore. Enough is enough.тАЭ TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestreamNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill The mayor is the latest figure on the left to condemn rioting that has started to dominate the racial justice conversation sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The final straw appears to have been when rioters brought their violence to his doorstep. After weeks of smashing windows and lighting small fires at police buildings, the federal courthouse and other public offices, protesters marched on PortlandтАЩs city hall Tuesday night, breaking in and scrawling graffiti. Hours later, Mr. Wheeler said it was time to put an end to that side of things. тАЬPulling people from their vehicles and beating them in the streets is a horrific, violent crime,тАЭ he said, describing an assault caught on video from earlier this month, for which a protester has been arrested. Mr. Wheeler, who also serves as police commissioner, rejected demands for a $50 million cut to the police budget as a first step to assuage protesters. He said his goal is to rethink policing and to have the broadest conversation possible. He said heтАЩs been trying to get a sense for the myriad sets of demands from those who are protesting тАФ most of whom are peacefully marching, but several hundred of whom nightly pick targets for mayhem. тАЬI had a meeting last week where a group of people frankly just shouted expletives at me. That was how they wanted to use their time. I had to end it a little early because my daughter was in the room,тАЭ Mr. Wheeler said. Mr. Trump this week renewed his call for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown to request him to deploy the National Guard. Ms. Brown, on Twitter, said the stateтАЩs National Guard is fighting forest fires and said Mr. Trump could better use his time trying to assist the state in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. тАЬOregon isnтАЩt interested in a role in your political theater,тАЭ she told the president. But Ms. Brown, a Democrat, also signaled that she, too, is worried that the protests are beginning to stain Portland and the racial justice debate. тАЬLet me be clear: ItтАЩs time for the violence and vandalism to end so Portland can focus on the important work to be done to achieve real change for racial justice. Those who have committed acts of violence will be held accountable,тАЭ she said. Wednesday night, after Mr. Wheeler held his press conference, was the first night this week that police did not declare a riot. That doesnтАЩt mean things were calm. Demonstrators marched on the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, disabling security cameras, vandalizing the building and pelting federal police with bottles and fist-sized rocks. Demonstrators also tried to blind the officers with lasers. About 200 people were involved, the Portland Police Bureau said. Seeing the violence, the local officers moved in, declaring the gathering an unlawful assembly тАФ a level below a riot тАФ and pushing the crowd away. The Portland officers said they, too, were pelted with rocks. After theyтАЩd pushed the crowd away from the ICE building, they disengaged, and the protesters started back toward ICE. Portland police say they moved in to make targeted arrests. One protester used pepper spray on police, and a fire was ignited, police said. Local police made 11 arrests, including charging one 26-year-old with unlawful use of pepper spray.  Copyright ┬й 2021 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

7272,"REPORT: Kenosha City-Owned Property Sustained $2M In Damages, Mayor Asks For $30M Riot Relief","Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, cost the city an estimated $2 million to city property alone, according to one city official who believes, by the end of an ongoing assessment, the cost will be much higher. тАЬThe cityтАЩs public works director, Shelly Billingsley, provided the estimate to local leaders Monday night on what it would cost to replace garbage trucks, street lights, and traffic signals, among other things that were destroyed or damaged in the unrest over the last week,тАЭ ABC News reported Tuesday. The city is insured, but as Minneapolis, Minnesota, residents are now finding out, insurance coverage for riot damage is limited, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, where тАЬdozensтАЭ of business owners are now finding out that demolition costs, particularly, wonтАЩt be reimbursed in full. The damage to city services may also hinder KenoshaтАЩs public works department in the long term. According to Billingsley, the garbage and utility trucks that were destroyed or damaged in the riots that followed an officer-involved shooting that left 29-year-old Jacob Blake in critical condition, function as snowplows in the winter, and the city may not be able to replace them before the first snowfall which, in Wisconsin, could come as early as October. Those trucks тАЬwere parked downtown to provide security and limit movement by protesters, were set on fire during the demonstrations.тАЭ KenoshaтАЩs mayor said Monday that he plans on asking the state and federal governments for assistance, and his initial request is $30 million, with the understanding that that number could climb significantly. Individual businesses, now picking up the pieces following three nights of nearly unrestricted rioting, looting, and arson, are also finding that the cost to rebuild may be more than anticipated. According to Fox Business, the used car dealership that rioters burned during the first night of unrest, sustained $1.5 million in damages by itself. тАЬThe owners of Car Source in Kenosha told local affiliate FOX 6 Milwaukee the business suffered $500,000 in property damage plus between $900,000 and $1 million in inventory damage during the first night of civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man,тАЭ the outlet reported. тАЬMore than 50 cars were reported to have been damaged in the early Monday morning blaze.тАЭ тАЬAnother local business, DaleтАЩs Jewelry, lost $200,000 worth of jewelry and incurred another $200,000 in property damage,тАЭ Fox 6 Milwaukee added. ThatтАЩs just the beginning. Local media reports include information about dozens of businesses affected by the unrest, and more than a dozen internet fundraisers, designed to help family-owned businesses recover and eventually rebuild, are now active. President Donald Trump, defying requests by the Wisconsin governor and other Democratic officials to stay away from the riot-torn area, will tour Kenosha on Tuesday and survey the extensive damage left from last weekтАЩs unrest. His opponent, Democratic 2020 presidential nominee, Joe Biden, addressed the riots in a speech on Monday but neglected to condemn the violence specifically, instead opting to blame TrumpтАЩs rhetoric for ongoing, national demonstrations and subsequent damage.

Tensions boil over during protests on both coasts The 100th consecutive night of protests in Portland quickly escalated into a riot Saturday as people hurled """"multiple fire bombs, mortars, rocks and other items"""" at officers, police said. One of the homemade bombs caught a community member on fire. Medics offered treatment at the scene, and the injured individual was later taken to a hospital by a private vehicle, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau. """"This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot,"""" the law enforcement agency said in a statement early Sunday. More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said """"it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"""" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor.

Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting """"burn it down"""" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association.

7403,Some Protests Against Police Brutality Take a More Confrontational Approach,"Advertisement Supported by The protests are moving into white residential neighborhoods, where activists demand that people choose a side. By Nellie Bowles PORTLAND, Ore. тАФ Terrance Moses was watching protesters against police brutality march down his quiet residential street one recent evening when some in the group of a few hundred suddenly stopped and started yelling. Mr. Moses was initially not sure what the protesters were upset about, but as he got closer, he saw it: His neighbors had an American flag on display. тАЬIt went from a peaceful march, calling out the names, to all of a sudden, bang, тАШHow dare you fly the American flag?тАЩтАЭ said Mr. Moses, who is Black and runs a nonprofit group in the Portland, Ore., area. тАЬThey said take it down. They wouldnтАЩt leave. They said theyтАЩre going to come back and burn the house down.тАЭ Mr. Moses and others blocked the demonstrators and told them to leave. тАЬWe donтАЩt go around terrorizing folks to try and force them to do something they donтАЩt want to do,тАЭ said Mr. Moses, whose nonprofit group provides support for local homeless people. тАЬIтАЩm a veteran. IтАЩm for these liberties.тАЭ Nearly four months after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, some protesters against police brutality are taking a more confrontational тАФ and personal тАФ approach. The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come тАЬout of your house and into the streetтАЭ and demonstrate their support. These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause. That includes a diner in Washington who refused to raise her fist to show support for Black Lives Matter, or, in several cities, confused drivers who happened upon the protests. But the tactics are dividing supporters of Black Lives Matter, with some worried that the confrontational approach will antagonize people who would be otherwise be receptive to the message, or play into conservativesтАЩ critique of the protests, which have been largely nonviolent nationally. Others, frustrated that little has changed since Mr. Floyd was killed, say that sitting idly and watching a protest without participating nowadays is to show tacit support for racism. тАЬWe donтАЩt need allies anymore,тАЭ said Stephen Green, an investor and entrepreneur in Portland who is Black. тАЬWe need accomplices.тАЭ In Rochester, N.Y., protesters have confronted people at outdoor restaurants, shaking dinner tables. Marchers in Washington also accosted people eating outside, urging everyone to raise their fists to show their allegiance to the movement. The more personal tactics echo those being used against elected officials, with activists showing up not only outside mayorтАЩs offices but their homes as well. The apartment building where the mayor of Portland lives has been vandalized. Protesters lit fires outside, ignited fireworks and broke into one of the businesses in the building on his birthday. In San Jose, Calif., demonstrators graffitied and egged the mayorтАЩs house and lit an American flag in front of it, according to the police. In Rochester, people have recently posted police officersтАЩ home addresses and information about their families, according to a police spokeswoman. In Portland, Jessie Burke, a local business owner who has Chinese ancestry and identifies as biracial, said the message of the movement was getting lost as the protests escalate and target ordinary residents in their homes. тАЬEveryone was looking for solutions at first, but now itтАЩs just a nightly fight that has gotten progressively more violent тАФ and every neighborhood worries that the fight will come to their neighborhood,тАЭ Ms. Burke said. тАЬItтАЩs: тАШWake up, wake up, you need to be in the street protesting if you stand for this.тАЩтАЭ Still, Mr. Green argued that the tactics were working, even as they inconvenienced him and his family. He described the smell of tear gas and wail of sirens as the marches came to his neighborhood, which he said kept his 7-year-old daughter awake. тАЬItтАЩs one thing if you can see something on TV, but if you can hear it and you can smell it in your house, that brings it home,тАЭ said Mr. Green, who grew up in Portland. тАЬWe need people willing to say, тАШIтАЩm down to lose this friend because stuff needs to change. IтАЩm down to make my neighbor uncomfortable.тАЩ Being nice wasnтАЩt changing anything.тАЭ Lindsey E. Murphy agreed. She marched with the protesters through one of PortlandтАЩs wealthiest neighborhoods on a recent night and found it deeply moving. She watched white demonstrators shouting at white residents that Black lives matter тАФ and the residents joining in with the chant. тАЬThe crowd was тАФ I wonтАЩt even say mostly white тАФ IтАЩll say it was an almost exclusively white crowd marching through the whitest neighborhood in Portland shouting тАШBlack lives matterтАЩ and тАШBlack lives are magic,тАЩтАЭ said Ms. Murphy, who is Black and hosts an educational childrenтАЩs YouTube series. тАЬWhat I was witnessing was a lamenting prayer, a cry of remorse and shame among the white people. ThatтАЩs what I saw. It was healing.тАЭ The American flag that generated controversy is displayed in Kenton, a neighborhood of Portland with small bungalows, lush front gardens and ripe fruit trees. Weeks after the confrontation, the husband and wife who fly the flag said they were fearful of retaliation from the roving protesters, who had found their phone number. But they say they will not be intimidated into removing the flag. тАЬI will not take my flag down,тАЭ said the husband, who declined to provide his name in a brief interview. The same night the protesters came to the coupleтАЩs door last month, they marched into KentonтАЩs commercial district and used restaurant picnic tables as fuel for fires. They collected the colorful wooden dividers the neighbors had recently built for outdoor dining and set those ablaze as well. Mr. Moses and others in the community ran into the protests with fire extinguishers. Protesters that night broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A man was later seen scrubbing the sidewalk graffiti тАФ a popular message was тАЬPPB = KKK,тАЭ meaning that the Portland Police Bureau is the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Green said that he opposed the destruction of property, but that he also understood it. And he believes, generally, that the more direct protest tactics in residential areas are working because they make the movement more personal, and reveal who truly supports change. If someone is against the movement, they keep their lights off or refuse to raise their fist, he said, adding that taking the debate into homes and to families is essential. Some residents in Portland say the tactics are escalating as the protests become increasingly dominated by white people, including anarchists and supporters of antifa, the diffuse collection of militant left-wing activists that has a strong presence in the region. The movement is splintered in Portland between more mainstream Black Lives Matter marches and the more aggressive, sometimes chaotic antifa or black bloc protests, where demonstrators dress in black and wear motorcycle helmets or ski masks to make it difficult to identify тАФ or later prosecute тАФ them. One night this month, there were two protests promoted on the Black Lives Matter Portland Events page: a тАЬnonviolent protestтАЭ in the city center and тАЬan autonomously organized direct action march.тАЭ No one appeared to be at the city center protest. But around 200 people were at the other event. They gathered in an unlit park in a residential neighborhood around 8 p.m. Everyone wore black, including some protesters who had on body armor and motorcycle helmets. They hastily set up picnic tables and supply booths in the dark, using cellphones for light to showcase their goods. There was a food table overflowing with protein bars and Monster energy drinks. A small free literature selection was set up on the grass and overseen by three people in ski masks. It was a popular offering, and people crowded around, craning to see the pamphlets. Titles included тАЬWhy Break WindowsтАЭ; тАЬI Want To Kill Cops Until IтАЩm DeadтАЭ; тАЬPiece Now, Peace Later: An Anarchist Introduction to FirearmsтАЭ; тАЬIn Defense of Smashing CamerasтАЭ; and тАЬThree-Way Fight: Revolutionary Anti-Fascism and Armed Self Defense.тАЭ The energy was something like a carnival in the dark. тАЬPaint balloons, get your paint balloons,тАЭ someone barked. But around 9:30, the group was in some organizational chaos. They had decided that the neighborhood close by was too racially diverse for them to protest in. They needed to go somewhere whiter. So the protesters caravaned 20 minutes away to Alberta, a more affluent neighborhood that began being gentrified in the 1990s. They reassembled and marched through the streets. Neighbors in impressive Craftsman-style homes pulled down their shades and turned off their lights, though many could be seen peering out of dark windows. One woman stepped out of an expansive home looking angry; upon seeing the crowd, she quickly retreated indoors. A few young couples stood in their doorways. A Black woman driving past honked and cheered. One white man stepped onto his patio clapping and hollering in support of the passing march. The group called for him to join. He smiled and waved them on, still clapping. They began to chant that he was spineless. He looked worried. But the march moved along, and he went back into his house. тАЬYouтАЩll never sleep tight, we do this every night,тАЭ the protesters chanted. Advertisement",1,3,1,4

But the detective insists that she needs to be arrested because she тАЬalready committed the offense.тАЭ The arrest appears to have involved at least four officers. тАЬIтАЩm happy to delete the post, this is ridiculous,тАЭ the woman said, pleading with the cops and noting that her two children are watching her get arrested. Victoria, which includes the city of Melbourne, has been under strict lockdown measures for the past month after a covid-19 outbreak caused an alarming spike in deaths. Police in Australia have arrested numerous people whoтАЩve tried to stage protests against the lockdown, but this is the first known instance of someone in Australia being arrested for merely posting about a protest on Facebook. тАЬThe search warrant entitles usтАФand weтАЩre required toтАФseize any computers, any mobile devices you have,тАЭ Detective Smith says. тАЬI didnтАЩt realize I was doing anything wrong. This is ridiculous,тАЭ the woman says. The woman can be seen getting very distressed as it becomes clear that sheтАЩs really being taken into custody and the detective barks тАЬlet me finish,тАЭ as he explains what the arrest warrant allows him to take. тАЬAny mobile telephone youтАЩve got, okay?тАЭ Smith says, before the police turn their attention to the phone thatтАЩs broadcasting on Facebook. The Victoria Police Department issued a statement to AustraliaтАЩs ABC News, saying that тАЬAny gathering of this nature is in blatant breach of the Chief Health OfficerтАЩs directions and puts Victorian lives at risk.тАЭ тАЬThose still thinking of attending the protest [тАж] can expect a swift and firm response from police,тАЭ the statement continues. тАЬWe will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.тАЭ The detective in the video, identified as Adrian Smith by the badge around his neck, appears to have been with Victorian Police since 2001, according to a profile on LinkedIn. Australia remains the only wealthy democracy in the world that doesnтАЩt have anything equivalent to AmericaтАЩs First Amendment protections for free speech. And even though itтАЩs clear lockdowns are sometimes necessary to defeat this global pandemic, itтАЩs hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook. This will likely only inspire covid-deniers to become more ridiculous and radicalized than they already are. Far-right goons on Rupert MurdochтАЩs TV station Sky News Australia have been complaining for months that many actions to fight the covid-19 pandemic have been too extreme. And in this case, they might finally be right. тАЬ...itтАЩs hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook.тАЭ Maybe not so hard - itтАЩs an incitement to behavior that is counter to the health of the population during a pandemic. Victoria has been under strict lockdown for a month and she is advocating breaking the rules (or laws in this case). fb has a broader reach, so 2 million views occurred instead of a few at some illegal protest gathering. тАЬOh. I didnтАЩt know!тАЭ",1,3,0,0

7673,"Portland Police Change Tactics: Crowd Control Ahead Of ├втВм╦ЬProtests,├втВмтДв Increased Arrests","Portland, Oregon, police offices debuted a new set of tactics Monday night, controlling protests before they turned violent and arresting suspected тАЬanti-fascistтАЭ operatives when the smaller march threatened destruction. The techniques took PortlandтАЩs protest movement by surprise, Oregon Lives reports, and left some demonstrators angry and confused, as an increased number of black-clad marchers ended up in police custody. PortlandтАЩs neighborhoods have suffered from ongoing unrest since late May. Until late August, though, much of the violence and destruction was contained to PortlandтАЩs city center, with a federal courthouse as riotersтАЩ top target. There, protesters tangled with an elite group of Customs and Border Protection Agents sent in to protect federal property. After the Department of Homeland Security withdrew their troops, protests moved to PortlandтАЩs residential neighborhoods, and PortlandтАЩs police department has been struggling to contain the unrest, often waiting until a demonstration becomes destructive before beginning the process of clearing streets and detaining individual marchers. Over the weekend, violence came to a head, protesters clashed with police and тАЬdozensтАЭ were arrested тАЬamid the protests in Portland included one juvenile and people from outside of Oregon, including California, Canada, Minnesota, Washington, and Texas, the Multnomah Co. SheriffтАЩs Office said Monday,тАЭ according to Fox News. The confrontations triggered OregonтАЩs Democrat Gov. Kate Brown to press Portland law enforcement to investigate тАЬany alleged incidentsтАЭ involving officers for signs of police brutality. Monday night, the Portland Police struck first, declaring a planned march to a police administration building тАЬunlawful,тАЭ moving through the protestersтАЩ camp, and confiscating materials typically used in riots. тАЬSeveral dozen Portland police moved on protesters gathering in a North Portland park Monday night even before the group started marching,тАЭ Oregon Live reported Tuesday. тАЬThe armored officers swept through the park, confiscating homemade shields and other articles. A scuffle broke out when officers tried to confiscate a picket sign that read тАЬvote,тАЭ multiple videos from the scene showed, and at least one person was detained. Police also deployed pepper spray.тАЭ The raid delayed the march and splintered it into smaller, more manageable factions. When demonstrators eventually regrouped, police immediately declared sidewalks and public roads off-limits. Eventually, Portland police declared the march an тАЬunlawful assemblyтАЭ and began arresting those suspected of inciting violence. тАЬTwenty-four people were ultimately arrested. The vast majority are accused of interfering with a peace officer, disorderly conduct, or both charges,тАЭ Oregon Live added. Although the scene became chaotic, for the first time in several weeks, protesters were unable to set the police administration building on fire. Oregon Live notes that Portland police expect that all 24 individuals arrested will be back on the street Tuesday night, given that the Portland District Attorney will not prosecute protesters for small crimes like тАЬinterfering with a peace officerтАЭ or тАЬdisorderly conduct.тАЭ In some extreme cases, Oregon State Police, also involved in nightly crowed control, can refer certain protesters for Federal prosecution тАФ as The Daily Wire earlier this month, the Oregon State Police were deputized by DHS тАФ but those cases are rare.

7791,Demonstrators Close Down I-94 In St. Paul In Protest Of Breonna Taylor├втВмтДвs Death,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) тАФ People are protesting in Louisville, the Twin Cities and across the United States Wednesday after a grand jury announced its decision in the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor. In Minnesota, activists say they are prepared for the long fight against injustice. Protesters rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday evening in a collective call for justice for TaylorтАЩs family, and a conviction for former officer Brett Hankison. They are coming down the ramp closing highway 94 East in Saint Paul pic.twitter.com/9I2J3hg4y1 тАФ Dymanh Chhoun (@Dymanh) September 24, 2020  Demonstrators then began marching down University Avenue, before dozens walked onto Interstate 94 in St. Paul after 8 p.m., closing both directions until about 8:40 p.m. (credit: CBS) Minnesota State Patrol squad cars were seen escorting small buses onto the highway, which may have been in preparation for arresting people who didnтАЩt disperse. It is unclear as of late Wednesday night if anyone was taken into custody. After a day of protests in Louisville, rioters started setting fires in the streets at night. CBS News reports that two Louisville police officers were shot, but it is not clear if it was connected to the protests. The grand jury charged Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment. The charges against him were for shooting into neighboring apartments, not directly related to TaylorтАЩs death. Louisville Police shot the 26-year-old EMT in March while executing a no-knock warrant at her apartment during a narcotics investigation. TaylorтАЩs boyfriend fired one shot at police, saying he believed they were intruders. Three officers returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were ever found in her home. тАЬThe decision before my office as the special prosecutor in this case is not to decide if the loss of Miss TaylorтАЩs life is a tragedy. The answer to that question unequivocally is yes,тАЭ Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said. Many in Minnesota, where George Floyd died while being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, say the grand juryтАЩs decision to charge only one of the three officers involved is not justice for TaylorтАЩs family. Some took to social media to express their concerns over the decision to charge Hankison, but not the other two officers, who still work for the Louisville Police Department. тАЬI think it was a compromise тАж brought to bear by the protest and national protest, and they felt like they have to do something,тАЭ community activist Mel Reeves, who founded the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, said. тАЬThe whole thing is just a mess, and again itтАЩs proof positive the system and the way that they do criminal justice is just wrong.тАЭ Reeves says itтАЩs infuriating that the life of the aspiring nurse is not worth charging the people who he says are responsible for her death. тАЬI think the other two people should have been charged with endangering her life as well, reckless endangerment of some kind,тАЭ Reeves said. He says activists across the country are digging in their heels, ready to take a stand against a system that he and others believe is not fair. For now they rally, march and try and change laws, seeking to create a system that has equal treatment for all. Last week, the city of Louisville agreed to pay TaylorтАЩs family $12 million to settle a civil lawsuit, the most the city has ever paid in a police misconduct case. The mayor also pledged police reforms, including an overhaul of search warrant procedures. The familyтАЩs attorney called WednesdayтАЩs decision outrageous and offensive.",1,3,1,4

7850,'Asian Americans Against Trump' fundraiser rallies community to vote,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since  Former Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang rallied Asian Americans to vote against Donald Trump in what he said could be a political gamechanger for the often overlooked community. """"If we get out in force and help Joe and Kamala win, this could be the major political awakening that Asian Americans have been waiting for a generation or more,"""" Yang said Monday night in a virtual fundraiser for Asian Americans Against Trump. Yang was joined by prominent Asian American leaders and public figures, including Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna and Grace Meng, Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim, Pachinko author Min Jin Lee. The American entrepreneur said Asian Americans have been """"forced to become more engaged"""" politically as they continue to suffer attacks from the """"hostility"""" targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community during the coronavirus pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been vulnerable to racist attacks, as President Donald Trump has used misleading and racist terms to describe the virus which experts said exacerbates microaggressions targeting the AAPI community. Yang said engaging with politics is a """"non-choice"""" and an obligation for AAPI voters. """"We have to roll our sleeves up and do things we have not done as a community as high of a level as, frankly, people in other communities,"""" Yang said. """"Our community can be the margin of victory and help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, our first Asian-American and Black woman vice president,"""" NY Rep. Meng said. Asian American voters are the fastest-growing voting bloc with over 11 million eligible voters. California Rep. Khanna warned that """"anyone who thinks this election is not going to be very close, [is] underestimating Donald Trump's power to do everything possible to win. He's frankly mobilizing the power of the US government on behalf of his campaign"""" and told Asian American voters that """"the only way we overcome that is by a massive turnout."""" But to mobilize Asian American voters, the AAPI community must actively dispel the model minority myth, which is """"used by leaders to either be a wedge against other people of color or they are being used as some sort of pestilence,"""" Lee said. Stereotyping Asian Americans as educated and hard-working, the model minority myth limits Asian Americans as people who are perfectly suited to be led, but not necessarily lead themselves. At the same time, the model minority myth does not capture the challenges that Asian Americans face and paints them under a monolithic narrative that is used as a wedge to pit them against other minorities. """"We still are in that place where we are expected to be the model minority, we are expected to be the ones who work hard, do really great work but never be the leaders,"""" Kim said. """"If we can get the message out to other Asian Americans to have a say and a stake in the country where we live тАФ we will be much more respected, much more powerful, and much more considered when it comes to the politics of our country.""""

7888,Biggest Thai protest in years cheers calls to reform monarchy,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Matthew Tostevin 4 Min Read BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people joined ThailandтАЩs biggest protest in years on Saturday, cheering calls to curb the powers of King Maha VajiralongkornтАЩs monarchy and for the removal of former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister. тАЬUnless the monarchy is under the constitution, we will never achieve true democracy,тАЭ protest leader and human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa told the crowd gathered within sight of the Grand Palace in central Bangkok. тАЬMore, more,тАЭ the crowd chanted after Arnon called for cuts to the royal budget and changes to the constitution to bring the king clearly under its control. The Royal Palace was not available for comment on the protest and the demands for reform. тАЬPeople can protest but they should do that peacefully and within the law,тАЭ said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri when asked to comment. Arnon said protesters would on Sunday declare тАЬthe country belongs to the people, not the monarchyтАЭ and place a commemorative brass plaque, echoing the words of the leaders of the 1932 upheaval that ended absolute monarchy. Protests that have been building in the southeast Asian country of 70 million since mid-July have broken a long-standing taboo by criticising the monarchy as well as seeking a new constitution and elections. Related Coverage  Thai authorities have said criticising the monarchy is unacceptable in a country where the king is constitutionally тАЬenthroned in a position of revered worshipтАЭ. Lese majeste laws mean those insulting the monarchy can be jailed. тАЬDONтАЩT TALK ABOUT THE KINGтАЭ Conservatives are horrified by attacks on the monarchy. тАЬYou can drive out the prime minister, but donтАЩt talk about the king,тАЭ commented one Facebook user as speeches were broadcast live from the protest. Reuters reporters estimated there were at least 30,000 people in the demonstration. Organisers said there were more than 50,000, while police said there were 18,000, still enough to make it the biggest since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup. Protesters have said they plan to march to Government House on Sunday morning. The king was not in Thailand and has spent much of his time in Europe since taking the throne from his late father in 2016. Speakers at the protest criticised the king for his absence and for his personal behaviour, comments that until recently would not have been made in public. тАЬThe people are humans, not dust under your royal feet,тАЭ student leader Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul told the protest early on Sunday. тАЬThe people want a king who protects democracy, not one who betrays the peopleтАЩs democracy.тАЭ The military, which proclaims itself the defender of the monarchy and national stability, has carried out several bloody crackdowns on protesters since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 as well as 13 successful coups. Sept. 19 is the anniversary of the coup against the populist then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006. Among the protesters were many of his red shirt followers, veterans of clashes a decade ago with pro-establishment yellow shirts. тАЬIтАЩm here to fight for the future of my children and grandchildren. I hope that by the time I die, they will become free,тАЭ said 68-year-old Tasawan Suebthai, a redshirt with amulets round her neck which she hoped would ward off bullets. The latest protests have been peaceful so far, but more than a dozen protest leaders have been arrested and released on bail. None has been charged under the lese majeste laws which protesters want scrapped. They also seek to reduce the kingтАЩs constitutional powers and his control over the palace fortune and units of the army.

(File) Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who was accompanying the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died after being gang raped in Uttar Pradesh, from Delhi to Hathras said on Wednesday that he was detained by Uttar Pradesh police midway and has now been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. """"The whole world saw how our sister was cremated at night in the absence of the family and without their consent, in connivance of the government and the police. The morality of these people is dead. I was detained by their police the night before and now I have been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. But we will fight,"""" Mr Azad tweeted in Hindi. He also shared a picture of the notice issued to him by the Saharanpur police, which stated: """"You are being informed that CrPC section 144 is imposed in the district. There are credible inputs that your tours and acts are gathering crowds, which may lead to law and order situation. Any untoward incident may happen. Hence, you are being informed that you will stay in your house only."""" The order, issued by the local Fatehpur police station in-charge Manoj Chaudhary, also warned Mr Azad of legal action for violating the instruction. Mr Chaudhary said it was not a """"house arrest"""" but Mr Azad has been asked to remain at his home in view of the law and order situation. """"There is no time limit on the order as such,"""" he added. According to functionaries of the Azad Samaj Party, which was launched by the Bhim Army chief in March, Azad and Delhi unit head Himanshu Balmiki had gone missing after 10 pm on Tuesday while they were on their way to Hathras, accompanying the family of the woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday. The Azad Samaj Party and affiliates of the pro-Dalit Bhim Army, among others, had joined the protests outside Safdarjung hospital in the national capital on Tuesday to demand justice for the gangrape victim and her family. """"There is no clue about the location of Chandrashekhar Azad and Himanshu almiki after they reached the Jewar toll plaza to get on the lane to Tappal, Aligarh,"""" Azad Samaj Party's core committee member Ravindra Bhati said earlier on Wednesday. He alleged that Mr Azad and Himanshu Balmiki were detained during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, but the police were not making it public. The body of the woman was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family members alleging that the local police forced them to perform the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, said that the victim was cremated """"according to the wishes of the family"""". Around 12:30 pm on Wednesday, dozens of Azad Samaj Party and Bhim Army activists reached the Tappal police station in Aligarh and staged a demonstration. """"A delegation of our representatives will be meeting senior police and administration officials to inquire about Azad and Balmiki,"""" Bhati told the protesters inside the Tappal police station compound. A senior Aligarh police official said: """"I have no idea about this (detention) claim.""""

7927,"Over 93% Of Protests This Summer Were Peaceful, Report Finds","The overwhelming majority of demonstrations this summer were peaceful, according to a new report, which also warns that the upcoming election and President Donald TrumpтАЩs incendiary rhetoric тАФ which has placed an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests тАФ could plunge the country into further crisis. The report, published Thursday, is from the U.S. Crisis Monitor, a collaboration between the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Princeton UniversityтАЩs Bridging Divides Initiative, which collects and analyzes real-time data on protest movements, using news reports, social media and other sources. тАЬThese data reveal that the United States is in crisis. It faces a multitude of concurrent, overlapping risks тАФ from police abuse and racial injustice, to pandemic-related unrest and beyond тАФ all exacerbated by increasing polarization,тАЭ the researchers wrote, warning that тАЬthese intersecting risks are likely to intensifyтАЭ as the November election draws closer. The report covers data gathered on protests between May 24, the day before police in Minneapolis killed George Floyd, and Aug. 22. During that period, the researchers collected more than 10,600 demonstration events across the country, with more than 7,750 of them related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests peaked in late May and early June, and while they have leveled off since, activists in many places across the country continue to hold largely peaceful demonstrations every day. The overwhelming majority of the protests тАФ more than 10,100 тАФ involved peaceful protesters, the researchers found. In only about 5%, or under 570 of the protests, did participants engage in violence. тАЬThe vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent,тАЭ the researchers wrote. тАЬIn more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity.тАЭ In the protests that became violent, they either involved state-sanctioned violence, such as violent intervention from local, state or federal authorities, or counterprotesters from extremist groups. The police or military тАЬdisproportionately used force while intervening in demonstrations associated with the BLM movement, relative to other types of demonstrations,тАЭ the researchers found. According to their data, in nearly 10% of BLM protests recorded this summer, police violently intervened by deploying tear gas, rubber bullets and/or pepper spray, as well as assaulting protesters with batons. During this period, the researchers also found an uptick in тАЬgovernment violence against journalists,тАЭ collecting over 100 separate incidents in at least 31 states and the District of Columbia. As for why public opinion polling suggests that people think a disproportionate number of the protests were violent when in fact they were not, the report attributes those perceptions to respondentsтАЩ existing political views, media coverage of violent protests and disinformation campaigns on social media. The report stresses the gravity of the situation, as the sources of this uprising тАФ from racial inequities, to continued police violence, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic тАФ are continuing. It warns that the upcoming election and TrumpтАЩs consistent attempts to sow discord and cast doubt on the election results will exacerbate these forces, citing тАЬmultiple steps to inflame these tensionsтАЭ from Trump and his administration. Trump has made much of his re-election campaign about тАЬlaw and order,тАЭ with an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests, racist appeals to white voters and false conspiracy theories about voting by mail. тАЬIn this hyper-polarized environment, state forces are taking a more heavy-handed approach to dissent, non-state actors are becoming more active and assertive, and counter-demonstrators are looking to resolve their political disputes in the street,тАЭ the researchers wrote. тАЬWithout significant mitigation efforts, these risks will continue to intensify in the lead-up to the vote, threatening to boil over in November if election results are delayed, inconclusive, or rejected as fraudulent.тАЭ Read the full report here.

7929,"BLM rallies, memorial for man killed in Portland shooting - Breitbart","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) тАФ People gathered for Black Lives Matter rallies Saturday evening in Portland, Oregon, and a memorial was held for the man fatally shot last weekend after a right-wing caravan went through downtown, as daily demonstrations stretched well past the three-month mark in the city. Hundreds of people gathered in a park just north of Portland in Vancouver, Washington, for a memorial service for Aaron тАЬJayтАЭ Danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer, who was killed Aug. 29. The suspect was himself shot and killed by police Thursday. Families showed up at the event with their kids, lining up for the free BBQ and picnicking on the grass at Esther Short Park. As various speakers addressed the audience on stage, attendees waved their flags enthusiastically, occasionally breaking out into chants of тАЬU-S-A!тАЭ Many of the crowd were President Donald Trump supporters, wearing MAGA hats and shirts or holding Trump-Pence flags. Some also waved flags and wore T-shirts showing support for the police. Some attendees also wore T-shirts with тАЬJustice for JтАЭ that were handed out at the event. Several local members of Proud Boys, a far-right group that has been involved in skirmishes at local protests, attended. тАЬWe honor a man who died for what he believed in,тАЭ said James Johnson, who has been a member of the Proud Boys for two years. Johnson, who is Black, said he disagreed with people who label the group as a white supremacist organization. The crowded regularly erupted in boos with any mention of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, whom Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson demanded apologize to DanielsonтАЩs family because they felt he had been unfairly portrayed. тАЬThis is about truth and lies,тАЭ Gibson said. тАЬJay was not a white supremacist.тАЭ Authorities released additional court documents late Friday detailing the moments before DanielsonтАЩs slaying. The documents included shots of security footage that showed the suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, ducked into a parking garage and reached toward a pocket or pouch at his waist before emerging to follow the victim. Danielson was holding bear spray and an expandable baton and had a loaded Glock handgun in a holster at his waist, according to the documents. Authorities have said they believe Reinoehl, who was fatally shot by law enforcement officers late Thursday in Washington state, killed Danielson. Witnesses told police that just before they heard gunshots someone said something like, тАЬwanna go,тАЭ which is frequently a challenge to a fight. Danielson, 39, was shot in the chest and died at the scene. The court documents were filed to support second-degree murder charges against Reinoehl, who was a supporter of antifa тАФ shorthand for anti-fascists and an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events. Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. They have often been marked by vandalism and violence. Black Lives Matter rallies were taking place in the city Saturday evening and night, and BLM supporters drove vehicles through the city earlier Saturday. At one event Saturday afternoon, people stenciled names on a pathway of Black people killed by police. Late Friday protests continued into early Saturday in Portland, with police declaring an unlawful assembly and arresting 27 people. A few hundred demonstrators had met at Kenton Park Friday before making their way to the Portland Police Association building, where officers warned protesters to stay off the streets and private property. Those who refused could be subject to citation, arrest, the use of tear gas, crowd-control agents or impact munitions, police said. The Portland Police Bureau issued a statement Saturday morning saying some officers reported that rocks, a full beverage can and water bottles had been thrown at them, prompting police to declare the gathering an unlawful assembly. Police said one woman who was detained was bleeding from an abrasion on her head, and she was treated by medics at the scene before being transported by an ambulance. The Portland Police Bureau said she jumped out of the ambulance and ran away before it left the scene, however. Most of those arrested were arrested on suspicion of interfering with a peace officer or disorderly conduct, police said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Michael Forest Reinoehl was killed by law enforcement officers, not federal agents. ___ Ding reported from Vancouver, Washington.  .

7955,Democrats Praise Peaceful Protests As Violent Riots That Are Trump├втВмтДвs Fault [Satire] | The Daily Wire,"CNN is now reporting that the mostly peaceful demonstrations for racial justice are all Donald TrumpтАЩs fault because theyтАЩre violent riots serving no purpose at all. In the cable networkтАЩs latest news show, Preposterous Sources, a Volkswagen pulls up and dozens of CNN commentators amazingly yet hilariously pour out onto the set and begin denouncing Trump for the violence that isnтАЩt happening in the mostly peaceful cities that are burning down for some reason that is TrumpтАЩs fault. After gleefully honking his red rubber nose, Don Lemon told his viewer, тАЬLet me pretend to be clear. These cities you see where innocent people are brutalized тАФ this is Donald TrumpтАЩs America тАФ or at least those parts of Donald TrumpтАЩs America that are governed by Democrats and thatтАЩs why theyтАЩre mostly peaceful.тАЭ тАЬAnd IтАЩm very serious about this as you can tell from the faint moistness in my eyes, which I feel gives me the sensitive look of a graceful doe in a peaceful forest glade,тАЭ Lemon added. тАЬBut perhaps thatтАЩs beside the point.тАЭ Joe Biden has also emerged from his basement to praise the mostly peaceful protests that are actually riots that are TrumpтАЩs fault, so he denounces them. Speaking to a broom closet he mistook for a meeting of very thin people re-enacting the Bride of Frankenstein, Biden said, тАЬCтАЩmon, man! These are people. When I look at them I see the whole history of a kind of thing that we need to do better because do I look like someone who would support radical leftists like my good friend Bernie Sanders or my running mate Kamala Harris?

7991,SPD watchdog: Sergeant did not intentionally target boy with pepper spray at protest,"SEATTLE тАФ Investigators with SeattleтАЩs Office of Police Accountability say officers did not intentionally target a young boy when they hit him in the face with pepper spray during a protest. Video of the boy crying, with milk running down his face to lessen the effects of the spray, went viral after the May 30 protest and led to 13,000 complaints filed with OPA. According to an OPA description released Friday, тАЬ(The boy) and his father moved towards a protester who had grabbed an officerтАЩs baton and was pushing into the police line. An SPD supervisor used pepper spray to move the protester back. In response, the protester ducked, causing the pepper spray to inadvertently affect the boy and his father.тАЭ >>RAW: Family of 7-year-old who was pepper-sprayed during Seattle protest speaks out OPA investigators found the sergeant who used the spray followed SPD policy in response to the protesterтАЩs actions, and investigators say their review of the body cameras worn by officers showed the sergeant was not able to see the child. After the incident, many people on social media claimed to identify the officer who used the pepper spray. Scroll down to continue reading But OPA investigators found the complainants identified the wrong officer, and that the pepper spraying was actually done by a sergeant. In another incident caught on camera, OPA investigators found an officerтАЩs use of force was тАЬimproper and inconsistent with SPD policy and trainingтАЭ when he placed his knee on a personтАЩs neck during an arrest for 13 seconds. That case is currently before Interim Chief Adrian Diaz for discipline. OPA received a total of 19,000 complaints regarding officer conduct during protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Most of the complaints referred to the same incidents and the civilian-led oversight office is currently reviewing about 100 cases. The following statement was released on behalf of the Avery family, whose boy was pepper sprayed: тАЬWe are deeply disappointed, but not surprised, by the result reached by the OPA. Today, they have confirmed that it is the Seattle Police DepartmentтАЩs position that the use of pepper spray in an intentional and reckless manner that it would strike an innocent child exercising their First Amendment rights is тАЬwithin policy.тАЭ We understand the OPA has said it is тАЬsorryтАЭ for these actions. But тАЬsorryтАЭ and тАЬregretтАЭ is not sufficient. We demand change. OPA did not address the whether the officers could have ta steps to prevent this from happening and, even further, no police officers attempted to render aid to the child making any apology tough to accept. Moreover, the OPA reached its conclusions by analysis and discussion of body camera footageтАФtapes that were not provided to the family or their legal counsel before today. The OPAтАЩs also refuses to identify the officers who used force in this incident. All of this undermines the claims of objectivity and transparency that the City purports to value. We continue to demand change, and this confirms that it is still deeply needed because the City of Seattle continues to remain indifferent to the suffering its police, and other City officials, have caused to black and indigenous people of color for decades, including the Avery family.тАЭ More news from KIRO 7 DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP Cox Media Group ┬й 2021 Cox Media Group.

8117,"Trump rallies may be responsible for roughly 700 Covid-19 deaths, study finds","The president is most likely a superspreader. A study conducted by four Stanford University economic researchers determined that 18 Trump campaign rallies, the bulk of which took place over the past summer, тАЬultimately resulted in more than 30,000 incremental confirmed cases of COVID-19тАЭ and тАЬlikely led to more than 700 deaths.тАЭ The study examined 18 counties that hosted Trump rallies in locations such as Tulsa, Oklahoma; Phoenix, Arizona; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, held between June 20 and September 22. It then compared the rate of post-rally Covid-19 infections in the host counties to that of comparable counties that did not host a rally. Attendance at individual rallies varied, but Trump often draws thousands of supporters to these events. тАЬFor the vast majority of county matching procedures we employ,тАЭ the authors wrote, тАЬour estimate of the average treatment effect across the eighteen rallies implies that they increased subsequent confirmed cases of COVID-19 by more than 250 per 100,000 residents.тАЭ The researchers тАФ B. Douglas Bernheim, an economics professor at Stanford, and Stanford grad students Nina Buchmann, Zach Freitas-Groff, and Sebasti├бn Otero тАФ extrapolated that figure to the entire sample, concluding that the rallies led to thousands of new infections and, likely, hundreds of deaths. As the authors acknowledge, trying to identify exactly how many infections resulted from a Trump rally (or any other potential superspreader event) is not easy. Factors such as whether the rally is held indoor or outdoor, whether a large number of infected people attended, whether attendees wore masks, and тАЬthe distribution of infected individuals among rally attendeesтАЭ can all lead to vastly different rates of infection. Likewise, while the authors estimate TrumpтАЩs summer rallies led to more than 700 deaths, they note those deaths were тАЬnot necessarily among attendees.тАЭ For example, a rally-goer may become infected with a mild case, but that same rally-goer might give the virus to his wife, who gives it to a coworker, who gives it to their sister, who dies of Covid-19. Nevertheless, the average discrepancies between the number of infections in counties hosting Trump rallies and the infection rates in other, similar counties suggest that at least some of TrumpтАЩs campaign events were superspreader events, potentially responsible for hundreds of lost lives. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that Trump was тАЬasking for troubleтАЭ by hosting mass political rallies as the number of Covid-19 infections surge. But FauciтАЩs warning does not appear to have deterred the president, who reportedly plans to host 14 rallies in the final three days of the 2020 campaign. ntribute today from as little as $3.

8252,Marcus Rashford Rallies Communities Across Country To Provide Free Meals Over School Holidays,"Published 10:32, 24 October 2020 BST| Last updated 10:37, 24 October 2020 BST It's been another fairly standard week for Marcus Rashford. Last Saturday he was bagging against Newcastle, on Tuesday he scored the winner against Paris Saint Germain, and since returning to British soil he has been working tirelessly to help feed disadvantaged children during half term. On Thursday, MPs voted against a motion to extend free school meals during the half term break amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But Manchester United and England forward Rashford - or Rashford MBE as we should now call him - did not give up the fight. As well as mucking in to lend a hand at the FareShare warehouse with his mum, the 22-year-old has also been helming a movement on Twitter. Using the hashtag #endchildfoodpoverty, he collated pubs, restaurants and cafes across the country that are stepping up to offer free meals during the half term break. After going at it all day yesterday (23 October), Rashford said he was knocking off with a feeling of 'pride'. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: """"Growing up we didn't have a lot, but we always had the safety net of the community. That community was my family. When we stumbled, we were caught with open arms. """"Even at their lowest point, having felt the devastating effects of the pandemic, local businesses have wrapped arms around their communities today, catching vulnerable children as they fell. """"I couldn't be more proud to call myself British tonight. I am truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. """"You want to talk about 'celebrities' and 'superstars', look no further than my Twitter feed and that's exactly what you'll find."""" He's not wrong either - here's just a handful of places that are helping out:  If you head to his Twitter feed you will find many more. In Scotland and Wales, governments have extended free meals during school holidays until Easter, while in Northern Ireland they'll be provided over the half-term break this month. A number of councils in England, including those in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, have also agreed to supply disadvantaged pupils with vouchers. McDonald's is also partnering with FareShare to offer one million free meals.

8347,[UPDATED] IGP Dissolves SARS After Widespread Protests,"CHANNELS TELEVISION Advertisement   The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has dissolved the infamous subunit of the force, the Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS). тАЬThe Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian Police, otherwise known as SARS, is hereby dissolved across all formations, the 36 state police command and the Federal Capital Territory where they currently exist,тАЭ the IGP said on Sunday. тАЬAll officers and men currently serving in the unit are to be redeployed with immediate effect.тАЭ The police authorities will be announcing new policing arrangements to address the offences of armed robbery and other violent crimes that fall within the mandate of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad later. AdamuтАЩs announcement followed days of widespread protests by Nigerians demanding scrapping of the unit which had gained notoriety for brutality and human rights violations.   Beyond scrapping the unit, he acknowledged reports of extortion and brutality, announcing a plan for an investigation. тАЬTo deal with the reports of crimes committed against citizens an investigation team will be constituted which will include civil society organisations for transparency and the culprits will be punished,тАЭ he said.  Read Also: #EndSars: Young Nigerian Jimoh Isiaq Killed In Ogbomosho, Seven Others Injured     The IGP did not give details of the time range the investigation will cover and whether it would include the harassment, threats and violence protesters suffered during the #EndSARS protest, including the killing of a young Nigerian Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso on Saturday. Witnesses said Isiaq was shot by the police. In contrast with the action of the police including the use of tear gas on protesters and the shooting witnessed, the IGP described the protests тАЬas a manifestation of the natural desires of citizens to participate in matters concerning policing and internal security in the nationтАЭ. To better relations between the public and the police, the IGP also announced тАЬa citizens and strategic (stake)holders forum will be formed to regularly interface with the leadership of the police at all levels and advice on police activitiesтАЭ.  #IGPDissolvesSARS pic.twitter.com/A1TvvefbOu тАФ Nigeria Police Force (@PoliceNG) October 11, 2020    The unit was founded in 1992 to combat cases of armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes. But SARS, instead, over time, has gained notoriety for its reckless intimidation of innocent civilians through puerile profiling and wanton abuse of power. Calls for the unitтАЩs disbandment date as far back as 2017 and while the Federal Government and police chiefs have made several pledges to implement reforms, reports of SARSтАЩ brutal activities against civilians have not abated. The current wave of protest can be traced to October 3, after another report of extra-judicial killing in Delta State (the police have denied any killing took place). It sparked fresh concerns and anger. Fuelled by this, and the outpouring of tales of traumatic experiences at the hands of officials of the unit, many Nigerians have held protests in many states, including Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory, Kaduna, Osun, Edo, and Imo.   RELATED LIVE: #EndSARS Protests Continue, Gain Momentum #EndSARS: Reps Unveil 30-Day Plan To Tackle Police Brutality   The Speaker House of Representatives, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, has also unveiled some of the plans by the House, aimed at tackling police brutality in the country. In a statement signed personally on Wednesday, Gbajabiamila said over the next 30 days, the House will work with the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), civil society and with Nigerians of good conscience to draft new legislation that establishes a system of independent accountability from the Force. According to him, the new legislation will hold erring members of the Police Force to account for their conduct in the performance of their duties and impose civil and criminal liability for violations of the Police Code. It will also compel the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to take responsibility for the failures of training and discipline that leads to such violations. Advertisement",1,3,0,0

8694,Task force warns against small gatherings as Trump rallies with thousands,"The White House coronavirus task force expressed concern about virus spread stemming from small household gatherings as coronavirus cases rise across the country and colder months approach. The warnings come as President Donald Trump continues ignoring precautions as he gathers thousands of mostly maskless supporters at rallies across the country in the final sprint before the election. Mitigation efforts тАУ wearing a mask, social distancing тАУ in retail settings such as stores and restaurants are working, the task force suggested in its weekly report released to states Tuesday. But the same precautions arenтАЩt being taken as smaller groups of friends and family gather in private home settings, which could be cause for alarm ahead of the winter months and the Thanksgiving holiday. тАЬWhat weтАЩre seeing as the increasing threat right now is actually acquisition of infection through small household gatherings. And particularly with Thanksgiving coming up, we think itтАЩs really important to stress the vigilance of these continued mitigation steps in the household setting,тАЭ US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield told the nationтАЩs governors in a conference call Tuesday, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN.  That messaging was communicated in reports released from the task force to each state this week. The White House has declined to make the reports public but CNN has obtained reports from several states. For example, reports for Vermont, Washington and Delaware warned against community transmission тАЬin smaller gatherings of family and friends where masking and social distancing recommendations are not followed,тАЭ recommending тАЬincreased messaging regarding the need to take these measures, especially given the element of prevention тАШfatigue.тАЩтАЭ The task force warned New Mexico that тАЬpeople must remember that seemingly uninfected family members and friends may be infected but asymptomatic,тАЭ which тАЬcan easily lead to spread as people unmask in private gatherings.тАЭ And the task force told Pennsylvania and Utah: тАЬRecent data suggest that smaller, more intimate gatherings of family, friends and neighbors are driving infection, especially as activities move indoors and adherence to face covering and social distancing wanes.тАЭ Based on the reports obtained by CNN, there are at least 26 states in the task force-defined тАЬred zoneтАЭ for new cases, meaning more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population. A report for Vermont reflected that no state is currently in the task force-defined тАЬgreen zoneтАЭ for cases. With between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population, Vermont, which has the тАЬlowest rate in the country,тАЭ now falls into the тАЬyellow zone.тАЭ The task force also sounded the alarms about the possibility of an outbreak in the Northeast region. Vermont has been тАЬextraordinarily successful,тАЭ the task force said, but added there is still cause for concern. The task force warned Ohio and New Mexico of reemerging spread, telling Ohio it is тАЬshowing early signs of reemergence of significant community spread.тАЭ Utah, home to the fifth-highest new case rate in the nation, was warned that the stateтАЩs тАЬincidence and test positivity are the highest they have ever been, but restrictions are low to minimal across the state.тАЭ тАЬClear mitigation policies with effective implementation are critically important, especially in areas with increasing incidence,тАЭ the Utah report said. Idaho, which has the sixth-highest new case rate, was told to have schools take steps to avoid what it described as тАЬCovid-19 stigma.тАЭ They included: тАЬ(Addressing) Covid-19 stigma related to responsibility for school closing by emphasizing consequences of Covid-19 (morbidity and mortality), posting hospitalization and mortality data on local and state websites, posting local trends in incidence and test positivity by age group (to show how transmission starts in the young and expands to older populations) and encouraging community cohesion and civic responsibility in local messaging.тАЭ The task force encouraged Idaho school districts to тАЬdeploy specific messaging on COVID-19 risks and strategies to avoid infection targeted to older individuals and those at risk for more severe disease.тАЭ And in Missouri, which still does not have a statewide mask mandate in place, the task force said community spread continues, in both rural and urban settings. тАЬMitigation efforts should increase to include mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding crowds in public and social gatherings in private to stop the increasing spread among residents of Missouri,тАЭ the report said. The task force also cautioned that there are тАЬsevere outbreaksтАЭ among nursing home residents and staff in Missouri. ┬й 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

With her vibrant pink hair and signature specs, Seraphine is about as unique as they come in terms of Champions. If a fictional character was based on you, we're pretty sure you'd know about it - but when it comes to """"Stephanie"""", she thinks the character has stolen her likeness. Posting on Medium, Stephanie explained her personal journey and why Seraphine is a problematic newcomer to LoL. The crux of the matter goes back to Stephanie's brief relationship with a Riot Games employee in 2019. She's confident this led to her likeness being used to create the K/DA pop princess. In the lengthy story, Stephanie spoke about her relationship with """"John"""". She explained, the pair had a mutual love of LoL, while John came up with Stephanie-inspired skin ideas for her favourite character, Ahri. She said she visited the Riot Games studio and was given artist drawings of herself as Ahri, which she said was """"strange"""". She continued to claim John wanted her to provide the voice for a top-secret project which she thinks was Seraphine. Despite her and John going their separate ways, Stephanie said she was shocked to see Seraphine's reveal (which was also the same day as her birthday). Stephanie said, """"As soon as I saw what she looked like and realised she was going to be a League champion, I started scrolling through her accounts, completely freaked out. My worries only grew, and my heart sank more and more with every post"""". Stephanie went on to point out how a lot of her poses seem to match Seraphine and how she thinks her cat was the inspiration for Seraphine's. Instead of putting the blame at John's door, she's instead pointing at Riot. She concluded, """"It's a quaint idea, but when you think about it more closely, the idea of a marketing team in some office in Los Angeles trying to sell a product by coming up with the most ~relatable~ and marketable things to tweet out of the account of a 'girl' who coincidentally looks like me, and talks like me, and sounds like me, and draws like me? It just makes me sick"""". Despite having """"no way to conclusively prove"""" Seraphine is based on her, Stephanie is standing by her story. Is there more to this twisted tale though? Stephanie's accusations have caught the attention of Riot Games, which has now issued a statement on the matter.  Despite some thinking there's a lot to Stephanie's claims, Riot maintains there's nothing untoward going on. A Riot spokesperson told PC Gamer, """"Seraphine was independently created by Riot Games and was not based on any individual. Additionally, the former employee [Stephanie] is referring to left Riot more than a year ago and was in a department and role that has no input whatsoever into the creative design process"""". In October, Senior Game Designer Jeevun Sidhu cited that his wife was the main influence for Seraphine. Also, last month, Stephanie's lawyer sent a legal demand to Riot Games. The defence has said Stephanie's claim тАЬlacks meritтАЭ and has invited her side to тАЬfurther discuss the facts"""". While Stephanie thinks Seraphine is based on her, Riot is sticking to its guns and is adamant this is just a simple coincidence.

WeтАЩre going to continue to do what we can do. WeтАЩre going to continue to make sure that we are flooding these dangerous hot spots with resources to make sure that we keep our communities safe, but weтАЩre fighting a losing battle. If we donтАЩt have a federal partnership on restricting access to guns in the hands of dangerous criminals, weтАЩve got to have partnership on that.тАЭ тАЬViolence is crimes of poverty, violence is crimes of people feeling like they have no hope,тАЭ Lightfoot said. тАЬWhen we see young men feeling theyтАЩre like only destiny is to be on a corner on somebodyтАЩs drug spot, we got to change that around and let them know that their future actually can and should be in careers and college, but weтАЩve got to make those kinds of investments to make that real. тАж WeтАЩve got to the find the resources, and we have them, to uplift neighborhoods.тАЭ Read the full report at the Washington Examiner.",1,3,0,0
9287,Trump Lost Support in Most Counties Where He Held Final Rallies,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since President Trump lost support between 2016 and 2020 in most of the areas where he held rallies in the final weeks of the election campaign, according to an NBC analysis of his campaign stops. NBC News analysed Trump's 30 campaign stops made in the two weeks before the final Election Day on November 3 before Biden was projected to have defeated the sitting president by 306 electoral college votes to 232. In 25 of the counties Trump visited, he achieved a smaller margin of victory than in 2016 or lost the county altogether, and he achieved a bigger margin of victory in just 5, NBC reported. The data does not prove whether the campaign stops had a net positive effect or whether his margin of defeat would have been even greater in those counties had he not made those stops at all. However, it does call into question parallel drawn by Trump and his supporters between the size of his rallies and his performance in the election. Campaign figures including Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, have claimed without evidence that the size of Trump rallies provide evidence that Biden was unlikely to have won the election. """"I think it's very hard for people to rationalize that a guy like Joe Biden тАФ who could barely scrape together 12 people to go to a campaign event for him, you know, even a couple of weeks ago тАФ suddenly somehow got around 80 million votes,"""" said Lara Trump in November. """"Donald Trump gained 10 million votes from 2016. We all were out working across the country hard. You saw that tens of thousands of people would come to Trump events and then, like, 12 to 20 people showing up to a Joe Biden event,"""" she said. The president on Sunday tweeted """"NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION!"""" in reference to a video showing a large presence at one of his rallies. The Trump campaign has failed to produce evidence to substantiate its claims of widespread voter fraud in the election. Multiple lawsuits filed by the president's lawyers which contested the election's outcome have also been unsuccessful. The president, who held dozens of rallies throughout this year despite the coronavirus pandemic, told crowds on several occasions during the campaign that he was only holding the rallies because he believed they would boost his vote count. He told a crowd in Michigan at one such rally in October that тАФ were it not for the pandemic тАФ he would not have been forced to speak to the assembled crowd of supporters. """"I probably wouldn't be standing out here in the freezing rain with you. I'd be home in the White House, doing whatever the hell I was doing. I wouldn't be out here,"""" he told the audience in Ingham County, Michigan. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before Biden flipped the state back this year. Trump's margin of defeat in Ingham County went on to increase from 27% to 32%, per NBC. The president made similar comments during a campaign rally in Erie County, Pennsylvania тАФ a key swing county in a battleground state тАФ earlier in October. """"Four or five months ago when we started this whole thing тАФ because, you know, before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie,"""" Trump said. """"I mean, I have to be honest, there's no way I was coming."""" Trump went onto lose the state by 1 point, having won it by 1.6 points in 2016, per NBC. He also lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes. Campaign figures including Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, have claimed without evidence that the size of Trump rallies provide evidence that Biden was unlikely to have won the election.",0,0,0,0

Despite numerous calls for Brackenfell residents to not engage with EFF protesters during their protest on Friday in the community, a white resident made his way to the front of the EFFтАЩs makeshift stage in the middle of Frans Conradie and allegedly hurled racial slurs and profanities at the crowd while the partyтАЩs general secretary, Marshall Dlamini, was speaking. EFF members responded to the provocation by beating and stomping on the man as he lay screaming at their feet. He was rescued by the police a few minutes later. Police called on the crowd to disperse, which was met with some resistance at first and quickly turned around as the police began firing rubber bullets, throwing stun grenades, released tear gas and utilised water cannon trucks. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: тАЬOne member of the public was injured after he attempted to disrupt the EFF protest. He was arrested on the scene on a charge of incitement and is also due in court in due course.тАЭ The injured resident said that he had decided to set the EFF crowd straight after their continuous calls for white people to be done away with. He said: тАЬI am willing to die for my country. What the EFF are saying and doing here is wrong. South Africa is for all who live in it regardless of race and culture. Both Afrikaans people and black people belong here, and I had to let them know that.тАЭ Meanwhile, a few metres away, dispersing protesters began throwing rocks and sticks in retaliation at police officers and law enforcement, vandalising a few businesses, private vehicles and state vehicles, as well as setting alight open fields in the community and surrounding areas. Van Wyk said: тАЬThe protest action in Brackenfell necessitated police action to maintain law and to disperse the riotous crowd. Eight protestors were arrested on charges of public violence and they are due in court once they have been charged. тАЬAs the protesters dispersed, they were throwing stones at all Law Enforcement agencies as well as businesses. Several SAPS, Law Enforcement vehicles, windows of businesses as well as private vehicles were damaged. тАЬThe crowd has since dispersed but the situation in the area is still being monitored.

9534,Staff at Jordan Peterson's publisher protest new book plans,"Penguin Random House CanadaтАЩs plans to publish a new work by the тАШprofessor against political correctnessтАЩ has reportedly prompted numerous complaints Last modified on Thu 21 Jan 2021 11.16 EST The announcement of a new book from Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, the self-styled тАЬprofessor against political correctnessтАЭ, has prompted dozens of complaints from staff at his publisher in Canada, according to a report. ViceтАЩs story on Tuesday said that the announcement of PetersonтАЩs forthcoming Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, a follow-up to his global bestseller 12 Rules for Life, prompted тАЬseveralтАЭ staff at Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) to confront management. PetersonтАЩs views on subjects including transgender rights, gender and race have been controversial. Last year, Cambridge University rescinded its offer of a visiting fellowship to Peterson. Also in 2019, 12 Rules for Life was temporarily pulled from sale in a New Zealand book chain after the terrorist attack on a Christchurch mosque, over perceived links between PetersonтАЩs fanbase and Islamophobia.  At a PRH Canada town hall meeting on Monday, one employee told Vice, тАЬpeople were crying about how Jordan Peterson has affected their livesтАЭ. PRH CanadaтАЩs diversity and inclusion committee reportedly received at least 70 anonymous messages about PetersonтАЩs book from staff, with only тАЬa coupleтАЭ in favour of the decision to publish. In response, PRH Canada told Vice that it тАЬimmediatelyтАЭ held the forum after announcing its plans to publish Beyond Order and тАЬprovided a space for our employees to express their views and offer feedbackтАЭ. The publisherтАЩs statement said: тАЬOur employees have started an anonymous feedback channel, which we fully support. We are open to hearing our employeesтАЩ feedback and answering all of their questions. We remain committed to publishing a range of voices and viewpoints.тАЭ PetersonтАЩs daughter Mikhaila tweeted a link to the Vice article. тАЬHow to improve business in 2 steps: Step 1: identify crying adults. Step 2: fire,тАЭ she wrote. тАЬIf you donтАЩt think adults willing to cry to get their way in a workplace is a problem тАж youтАЩre clearly not in charge of many people.тАЭ PetersonтАЩs Beyond Order, which is due out in March, promises to deliver тАЬ12 more lifesaving principles for resisting the exhausting toll that our desire to order the world inevitably takesтАЭ. тАЬIn a time when the human will increasingly imposes itself over every sphere of life тАУ from our social structures to our emotional states тАУ Peterson warns that too much security is dangerous,тАЭ says the publisher. тАЬWhatтАЩs more, he offers strategies for overcoming the cultural, scientific, and psychological forces causing us to tend toward tyranny, and teaches us how to rely instead on our instinct to find meaning and purpose, even тАУ and especially тАУ when we find ourselves powerless.тАЭ The Guardian understands that no staff at PRH in the UK have complained about the decision to publish Peterson again. The protests in Canada over PetersonтАЩs book follow HachetteтАЩs decision to drop Woody AllenтАЩs memoir after a staff walkout, and reports that staff at JK RowlingтАЩs publisher in the UK were told they could not refuse to work on her new childrenтАЩs book The Ickabog because they disagreed with her views on transgender rights. This article was amended on 21 January 2021 to remove a statement that the offer to Jordan Peterson was rescinded тАЬfollowing criticism from faculty and studentsтАЭ.

He also insisted that the military only fired into the air and not directly at the #EndSARS protesters. While explaining that the blank bullets used cannot cause any damage to the flesh, Brigadier Taiwo said if real bullets were indeed fired, one bullet had the potency to kill three persons at one shot.

Brigadier General Taiwo also maintained that the troops were not only deployed to the Lekki tollgate but also to other areas like Badagry, Ikorodu, Apapa, Alimosho, Epe, Lagos Island and the entire state to restore normalcy. Furthermore, he claimed that after the soldiers left the area, hoodlums went on to destroy the toll gate plaza.

9547,Thailand protests: clashes cause chaos outside parliament,"Skirmishes break out between rival groups as police fire water cannon and MPs flee in boats Last modified on Tue 17 Nov 2020 23.36 EST ThailandтАЩs riverside parliament was surrounded by chaos as police repeatedly fired water cannon at pro-democracy protesters, clashes broke out between the demonstrators and royalist counterparts, and MPs abandoned the scene in boats. Five people were treated for gunshot wounds, including at least two students, after the most violent clashes since a youth-led movement emerged in July. A total of 55 people suffered injuries in the protests, according to BangkokтАЩs Erawan emergency medical centre.  For months, a youth-led protest movement has held escalating demonstrations calling for democratic reforms. They have demanded the removal of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general, and have breached longstanding taboos to call for an accountable and transparent monarchy. Dozens have faced legal charges for taking part in the rallies. On Tuesday, as lawmakers considered whether to debate several proposals to amend the constitution тАУ an issue central to protestersтАЩ demands тАУ thousands gathered outside the Thai parliament, which had been blocked off with razor wire and concrete. Protesters outside parliament mocked the military-backed government by bringing giant inflatable ducks to the rally, which some joked would float down the river to an otherwise inaccessible parliament. The ducks, nicknamed by some as their тАЬnavy forceтАЭ, were instead used to shelter from blasts of water cannon, which in some instances contained chemical irritants. Teargas was also used on pro-democracy protesters, who wore hard hats and goggles for protection. Groups of demonstrators could be seen coughing and pouring water over their faces to ease the stinging. тАЬStop accusing us of violating the law, you [the police] are violating the law by hurting people,тАЭ Parit Chiwarak, a prominent student leader also known as Penguin, said through a megaphone later in the evening. тАЬWe are fighting for a better future of our country and for everyone so donтАЩt fire water cannon on us.тАЭ A police spokesman said water cannon were used because protesters were attempting to break into a restricted area. Despite a heavy police presence around parliament, skirmishes broke out between royalists, who wore yellow shirts, and pro-democracy protesters during the afternoon. Both sides threw stones and water bottles after police retreated from one of the barricades, the first major clash between royalists and the student-led movement. Skirmishes occurred again later in the evening, when gunshots were fired. In one video, shared widely on social media and apparently filmed among yellow shirt royalists, a speaker warns the opposing side to control their crowd, and not to throw a firecracker. What sounds like several gunshots are fired. A person close to the camera, far from the front line, watches on saying тАЬshoot them, shoot themтАЭ. Mint Suttawan, an MP for the progressive opposition party Move Forward, told the Guardian she had visited two injured students at Rama 9 hospital. Both had been shot in the leg but were conscious, she said. They had attended the demonstration as protest guards for the pro-democracy movement тАУ volunteers who stand on the front line to manage the crowds and ensure demonstratorsтАЩ safety. Royalists held a counter-demonstration earlier in the day, where they urged lawmakers not to change the constitution. тАЬAmending the constitution is going to lead to the abolition of the monarchy,тАЭ the royalist leader, Warong Dechgitvigrom, told reporters. Protesters have said they do not want abolition of the monarchy, but believe it should be brought under the constitution. They have also called for the removal of harsh defamation laws that protect the royal family from criticism. Anyone who тАЬdefames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir apparent or regentтАЭ can face up to 15 years in prison. Strict l├иse majest├й laws make it a crime to criticise, defame or insult members of Thailand's royal family. In practice, this means open discussion or critical reporting about the royal family is considered illegal. The military junta, which seized power in 2014, has been criticised for using the law тАУ which can see people jailed for up to 15 years on each count тАУ to stifle opposition. In 2015, a man was jailed for 30 years over six Facebook posts and the local printer of the New York Times refused to publish an edition with a story on the king. Surrounded by the unrest, several MPs and senators left parliament in the afternoon on boats from a pier behind the building. On Wednesday they are expected to vote on which, if any, of seven constitutional amendment bills should be debated. The most controversial, which aims to undo the changes introduced under military rule, has been put forward by the human rights NGO iLaw. It says the 250 military-appointed senators should be replaced with elected officials, and does not, like other proposals, prevent changes to parts of the constitution that relate to the monarchy. However, despite receiving about 100,000 signatures it is unlikely to pass. The royal palace has not responded to the protests, although the king has said of demonstrators тАЬwe love them all the sameтАЭ. In recent comments, he described Thailand as the тАЬland of compromiseтАЭ.",1,3,0,0

9678,Dozens protest outside of home of L.A. County's public health director,"Dozens of demonstrators converged outside the Echo Park home of Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Sunday afternoon to express their displeasure with a new round of COVID-19 restrictions that will take effect Monday. Carrying signs and waving flags, the protesters called on Ferrer to тАЬOpen L.A.тАЭ and chanted, тАЬNo science. No data. No shutdown.тАЭ Few of the 50 or so demonstrators were wearing face masks. More people here now, and a bit of a shouting match erupting between the protesters and a resident on this street. pic.twitter.com/SQ6YYZ2FcB   The countyтАЩs latest Safer at Home order was announced Tuesday amid an alarming increase in coronavirus cases and COVID-19 deaths. Its slew of restrictions includes a ban on most gatherings, stricter limits on retail businesses, and closures of playgrounds that arenтАЩt part of a school or childcare center. The order will be in effect for three weeks, until Dec. 20. Those restrictions came on the heels of a previously announced rule that suspended outdoor dining at restaurants throughout most of the county. Pasadena, which has its own health department, opted to allow outdoor dining to continue. In addition, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced a statewide curfew that forbids nonessential gatherings with members of other households between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The recent restrictions have drawn the ire of business owners, exhausted parents and others who are simply losing patience with the pandemic way of life. One of the protesters outside FerrerтАЩs home carried a sign that read, тАЬNewsom and Ferrer are non-essential.тАЭ Another shouted, тАЬHow dare you take away our guns and lock us in?тАЭ California L.A. CountyтАЩs new stay-home order is the strictest in California. HereтАЩs how it works Los Angeles County has issued a new COVID-19 pandemic order in a desperate move aimed at slowing an unprecedented surge of coronavirus infections.   Some of the demonstrators raised other grievances, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Several people brought Trump flags, and one held a sign that declared тАЬTrump won.тАЭ Several people got into heated exchanges with FerrerтАЩs neighbors, including one resident who called the protesters тАЬfascistsтАЭ and Nazis.тАЭ Though noisy at times, the protest remained peaceful until the demonstrators dispersed around 5 p.m. California Photos: Gov. Newsom announces new stay-at-home order as COVID-19 hospitalizations hit record Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced a stay-at-home order affecting most of California.   A Los Angeles Police Department vehicle was parked in FerrerтАЩs shared driveway to monitor the protest. LAPD officials could not be reached for comment Sunday night. For the most part, L.A. County residents have taken heed of the public health orders intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the community. But patience is wearing thin, and some people have become more vocal in opposing them. The county is now averaging nearly 4,200 new coronavirus cases each day, a tally that exceeds the number of daily cases reported during the summer. Hospitalizations have been on the rise for the past two weeks and are now just shy of 2,200, nearly meeting the previous high from the summer. Over the last week, L.A. County has averaged nearly 28 COVID-19 deaths each day. Times staff writers David Zahniser and Laura Nelson contributed to this report.

9725,Illinois 17-year-old charged with killing two people during Wisconsin protest posts $2 million bail,"KTLA by: Associated Press Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of killing two protesters days after Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wis. (Antioch Police Department via AP) A 17-year-old from Illinois who is charged with killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin and whose case has become a rallying cry for some conservatives posted $2 million bail Friday and was released from custody. Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz during a demonstration Aug. 25 that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. He posted bond through his attorney at about 2 p.m., Kenosha County SheriffтАЩs Sgt. David Wright said. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense. He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesnтАЩt permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless theyтАЩre hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing. His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for him has attracted millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September. HuberтАЩs father, John Huber, asked Kenosha County Circuit Court Commissioner Loren Keating during a hearing Nov. 2 to set RittenhouseтАЩs bail between $4 million and $10 million. Huber said Rittenhouse thinks heтАЩs above the law and noted the effort to raise money on his behalf. He also suggested militia groups would hide him from police if he were released. RittenhouseтАЩs attorney, Mark Richards, asked for $750,000 bail. Keating ultimately set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse was a flight risk given the seriousness of the charges against him.

9730,Ilhan Omar Likens Trump Rallies to 'Klan Rallies' - Washington Free Beacon,"ADVERTISEMENT SHARE Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) likened President Donald Trump's campaign rallies to Ku Klux Klan rallies in a Monday interview with the Washington Post. Trump """"chose to speak about me at every single rally, didn't really matter where he was, sometimes multiple times in a day, as he held his Klan rallies across the country,"""" Omar said to Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart. Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as """"the Squad,"""" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as """"a four-year assault"""" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party """"isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"""" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, """"the Squad"""" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) quoted a Klansman to criticize Trump's national security policies in a tweet last year, and failed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared Trump's rallies to Nazi meetings.

9764,"Trump supporters protest outside vote centers in Arizona, Michigan","NewsNation Now Alexa Mencia PHOENIX (NewsNation Now) тАФ Crowds of supporters for President Donald Trump gathered outside vote centers in Arizona and Michigan Wednesday, expressing concerns about the counting of ballots. In Phoenix, roughly 100 protesters converged in front of the Maricopa County Elections Department, chanting тАЬStop the steal!тАЭ and тАЬCount my vote.тАЭ Many were without masks and some were armed with rifles and handguns. The rally comes as The Associated Press has declared Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the winner in Arizona, flipping a state that has a long political history of voting Republican. Trump had won Arizona in 2016. The AP called the race early Wednesday morning, after an analysis of ballots concluded that there werenтАЩt enough outstanding to allow Trump to catch up. Gilbert resident Chris Michael, 40, joined protesters outside the Maricopa County Elections Department Wednesday night. Michael told Reuters that he came to make sure all votes are counted. He said he wants assurances that the counting was done тАЬethically and legally.тАЭ Republican Rep. Paul Gosar also joined the crowd, declaring: тАЬWeтАЩre not going to let this election be stolen. Period.тАЭ Observers from both major political parties were inside the election center as ballots were processed and counted, and the procedure was live-streamed online at all times. Several sheriffтАЩs deputies blocked the entrance to the building. The vote-counting carried on into the night, Maricopa County Elections Department spokeswoman Megan Gilbertson said. Two top county officials тАФ one a Democrat, the other a Republican тАФ issued a statement expressing concern about how misinformation had spread about the integrity of the election process. тАЬEveryone should want all the votes to be counted, whether they were mailed or cast in person,тАЭ said the statement signed by Clint Hickman, the GOP chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Democratic Supervisor Steve Gallardo. тАЬAn accurate vote takes time. тАж This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.тАЭ In Detroit, Trump supporters gathered by a ballot-tallying center shortly before The Associated Press declared that Biden had won Michigan. Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Center and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the counting area. They chanted тАЬStop the count!тАЭ and тАЬStop the vote!тАЭ Earlier, TrumpтАЩs campaign filed a lawsuit in a bid to halt the count, demanding MichiganтАЩs Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the voting and the counting. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying тАЬusing a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately.тАЭ The Trump campaign also filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Georgia Wednesday, laying the groundwork for contesting the battleground states as he slipped behind Biden. The new filings, joining existing Republican legal challenges in Pennsylvania and Nevada, demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and absentee ballot concerns, the campaign said. Protests were also reported in other areas of the country, including in Portland, where a riot was declared Wednesday. Many took to the streets in Seattle and New York City overnight, as well.

Ian Chappell wants shots like this from Glenn Maxwell outlawed.Source:Getty Images ItтАЩs only taken two one-dayers for Ian ChappellтАЩs first angry rant of the summer. The former Australian captain has unloaded his frustration at batting tactics employed by Glenn Maxwell and David Warner he believes are blatantly unfair. Maxwell in particular is one of the finest exponents of switch-hitting, where a batsman faces up in his normal position before moving his feet тАУ and sometimes altering his grip тАУ to effectively swap his stance. Chappell conceded it was тАЬamazingly skilfulтАЭ but insisted it wasnтАЩt fair on the bowler after two run-fests at the SCG to open the series. тАЬHow can one side of the game, ie. the bowlers, they have to tell the umpire how theyтАЩre going to bowl. And yet the batsman, he lines up as a right-hander тАУ IтАЩm the fielding captain, I place the field for the right-hander тАУ and before the ballтАЩs been delivered, the batsman becomes a left-hander,тАЭ Chappell told nine.com.au. тАЬOne of the main reasons why heтАЩs becoming a left-hander is so he can take advantage of those field placings. IтАЩd love the administrators who made those laws, IтАЩd love them to explain to me how thatтАЩs fair.тАЭ Chappell encouraged India to revolt against the practice by challenging the on-field umpire. тАЬI just canтАЩt believe the players donтАЩt arc-up about it. If IтАЩm captain, IтАЩm going to take the ball myself and IтАЩm going to tell the umpire IтАЩm bowling right-arm over [the wicket], and then IтАЩm going to run in and bowl around,тАЭ he said. тАЬObviously the umpireтАШs going to complain and IтАЩm going to say, тАЩWell, you stop him (the batsman) doing something I think is totally unfair and IтАЩll stop doing something unfairтАЩ. If the administrators arenтАЩt smart enough to change it, then my attitude always was, тАШWell, IтАЩll take the law into my own handsтАЩ.тАЭ Glenn Maxwell positions himself for a switch hit. (Photo by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images)Source:Getty Images Chappell suggested a solution to the problem that wouldnтАЩt result in the tactic being completely lost from the game. тАЬItтАЩs very simple тАж All youтАЩve got to say is that if the batsman changes the order of his hands or his feet [as the bowler runs in], then itтАЩs an illegal shot,тАЭ Chappell said. тАЬ(But) if the batsmanтАЩs right-handed and wants to play switch-hit [in advance of the bowler running in], any bowler worth his salt will say, тАШGo for your life, mate, IтАЩll take my chancesтАЩ. But when he completely becomes the opposite-handed batsman to what he faces up as, then itтАЩs not fair. тАЬIf heтАЩs good enough to do it by excellent footwork or whatever other means he can devise, I donтАЩt have a problem with it. But when itтАЩs blatantly unfair, it annoys the hell out of me.тАЭ A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

2945,Coronavirus: Fox News hosts keep telling people to go and protest 'for their freedom' instead of social distancing,"As social distancing and lockdown measures are extended in many countries, people are starting to get frustrated. In some instances тАУ instead of staying inside, or writing to their representatives тАУ people are starting to defy lockdown and hold physical protests. Fox News hosts are among those encouraging people to carry out physical protests against stay-at-home orders, potentially endangering the lives of countless others. In Michigan, a mass protest was organised in defiance of the governorтАЩs stay-at-home orders. Recent figures put the number of deaths in Michigan at 1,900. Laura Ingraham, a prominent host on FOX news, tweeted in approval and suggested that the same may start to happen in other states. Initially, protesters were supposed to create traffic gridlock and hold signs from their cars, but a group gathered on the steps of MichiganтАЩs city hall. They said that the damage caused by the economic impact of stay-at-home orders was greater than the damage caused by Covid-19. Other Fox News hosts, such as Jeanine Pirro, expressed similar sentiments on TV, saying that health officials had """"overblown sentiments"""" and that the American spirit would not тАШtake itтАЩ. She also said that what had happened in Lansing, Michigan, would start to happen all over the country. On the Fox news website, coverage of protests featured prominently. Ingraham, Pirro and a number of other Fox News hosts were calling for stricter lockdown measures and more guidance from central government towards the end of March, although they appear to have changed their mind after a few weeks. ThereтАЩs little evidence to suggest that any states in the US have reached a peak in Covid-19 cases. Other prominent personalities in right-wing media have expressed frustration at public health measures тАУ pro-Trump commentator Candace Owens tweeted in anger after being asked to wear a mask in a supermarket (she also said that she had been going every day).

3072,"Majority of Michigan residents support Governor Whitmer's coronavirus response, despite anti-lockdown protests, poll shows","The majority of Michigan residents approve of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, despite last week's large protest against the state's stringent stay-at-home order, polling has shown. The new survey, published Monday and conducted by the Detroit Regional Chamber, found that 57 percent of respondents approved of Whitmer's coronavirus response in Michigan, while just 37 percent disapproved. Meanwhile, only 44 percent of those polled approved of President Donald Trump's response to the crisis, while 50 percent disapproved. Among those surveyed, 39 percent self-identified as Democrats, while 35 percent identified as Republicans and 26 percent said they were independents. In total, 600 Michigan residents were polled. Last Wednesday, thousands of protesters descended on Lansing to demonstrate against the social-distancing requirements put in place by Michigan's Democratic governor. While organizers encouraged demonstrators to remain in their cars as they drove through the city holding signs and waving flags, some protesters exited their vehicles and disregarded social distancing measures. Demonstrators held signs that read: """"Security Without Liberty Is Called Prison,"""" """"Liberty Once Lost Is Lost Forever"""" and """"Recall Whitmer,"""" USA Today reported. Trump later voiced his support for the anti-social-distancing protests in Michigan as well as in other states around the country. """"Liberate Michigan!"""" the president tweeted on Friday. """"A small segment of the state is protesting, and that's their right,"""" Whitmer told CNN on Wednesday. """"The sad part is, though, that the more that they're out and about, the more likely they are to spread COVID-19 and the more likely we're going to have to take this posture for a longer period of time,"""" she warned. As of early Monday afternoon, Michigan had more than 30,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Of those, 2,374 people have died. Tori Meyer, a resident of Berrien County in southwest Michigan, told Newsweek that she supported Whitmer's stay-at-home order and believed the governor was taking appropriate steps to protect the people of her state. """"Hands down, I trust Whitmer more than Trump,"""" Meyer, 30, said. """"Instead of leading us, he's gone back and forth with his stance on the coronavirus, refuses to fully address the issues and instead let the states fight it out with each other, so to speak."""" Meyer said she wasn't surprised that people had protested the lockdown but felt embarrassed by the demonstrations. """"It's embarrassing for others to see that and think maybe all Michiganders are that way,"""" Meyer said. """"No one wants to be stuck at home right now, but I look at this as my civic duty. Is it inconvenient and kind of boring? Yes. But the more we are all in this together and staying home, the faster this will be over."""" She also said she was """"infuriated"""" by Trump's tweet about Michigan. """"He's fanning the flames and blatantly inciting violence in our state, which is the last thing we need right now,"""" Meyer told Newsweek. Several governors have criticized Trump for supporting the demonstrations against social-distancing measures. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, who faced a similar protest in Annapolis on Saturday, told CNN on Sunday that the demonstrators were essentially protesting against guidelines laid out by the White House. """"So then to encourage people to go protest, the plan that you just made recommendations on on Thursday, it just doesn't make any sense,"""" Hogan said. """"We're sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations."""" National polling has shown that the majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders, with most respondents more concerned that the government will move too quickly to reopen the economy than too slowly. A survey released Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed that 58 percent of respondents were concerned that the U.S. would ease stay-at-home guidance too quickly, while only 32 percent said they were concerned the economy wouldn't be reopened quickly enough. A similar poll released last week by Pew Research Center found that 66 percent were concerned that state governments would be too quick to ease their coronavirus restrictions.

But perhaps out of wishful thinking, members of the right-wing media are nonetheless framing protests as the Tea Party movement reincarnated. тАЬA lot of people are very proud of you,тАЭ said Fox News host Jeanine Pirro during a Saturday night interview with Meshawn Maddock, an organizer behind the so-called тАЬOperation GridlockтАЭ protest in Lansing, Michigan. тАЬPeaceful protests, civil liberties, itтАЩs what weтАЩre all about. Keep going.тАЭ The segment aired after PirroтАЩs colleagues had spent days praising the protests. Last week Tucker Carlson hosted Maddock and thanked the Michigan Conservative Coalition activist for her service. On Saturday morning Fox & Friends prominently displayed the locations of future rallies on a map of the countryтАФexactly what the network did years prior to promote the anti-Obama Tea Party protests. An article published on FoxтАЩs website took the effort a step further, embedding a tweet with contact information for those who wished to join the Wisconsin Freedom Rally. On Friday conservative talk radio giant Rush Limbaugh cheered on the protesters by citing historic examples of American bravery and sacrifice, including U.S. involvement тАЬin World War II,тАЭ adding, тАЬThis shutdown, and hunkering down in total fear, is not a hallmark of American history.тАЭ Moving in lockstep with his media allies, the president has personally incited the protests, writing in three separate tweets on Friday, тАЬLIBERATE MINNESOTA,тАЭ тАЬLIBERATE MICHIGAN,тАЭ and тАЬLIBERATE VIRGINIA...save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!тАЭ Speaking at the White HouseтАЩs coronavirus task force briefing on Sunday, Trump doubled down, calling the protesters тАЬa very orderly group of people,тАЭ despite the fact that some flew Confederate flags and flashed signs with swastikas, and falsely claiming that protesters тАЬwere all six feet apart,тАЭ despite an abundance of photo and video evidence to the contrary. тАЬTheir life was taken away from them. They want their life back,тАЭ he concluded. Responding to a question on the protestersтАЩ use of Nazi symbolism, the president delivered a remark reminiscent of his infamous тАЬvery fine people on both sidesтАЭ line following a 2017 white nationalist rally: тАЬWell that, I totally would say, no way. But I didnтАЩt see that.тАЭ TrumpтАЩs outspoken support marks the latest flashpoint in the White HouseтАЩs ongoing war with states amid the pandemic. A number of governors aired their opposition to TrumpтАЩs comments throughout Sunday, including Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who asserted that now is тАЬnot the time for protests, this is not the time for divisivenessтАЭ; and Washington governor Jay Inslee, who condemned TrumpтАЩs fostering of тАЬillegal activityтАЭ and said, тАЬIt is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.тАЭ Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, the rightтАЩs primary target in their justification of the rallies, did not directly address them, but she did explain why some in Michigan are failing to grok the reasoning behind social distancing policies. тАЬThe hard part of public health is when youтАЩre doing a good job, youтАЩre saving lives, and itтАЩs hard to quantify precisely what that looks like,тАЭ she told CNN. And Maryland governor Larry Hogan noted that it is not тАЬhelpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the presidentтАЩs own policy.тАж You canтАЩt start to reopen under his plan until you have declining numbers for 14 days, which those states and my state do not have.тАЭ HoganтАЩs deputy communications director also noted that MondayтАЩs Reopen MarylandтАУorganized rally in Annapolis saw тАЬmore media inquiriesтАЭ than actual protesters. Indeed, the gatherings have typically featured attendees in the dozens or low triple figures, making MichiganтАЩs Thursday crowd of roughly 3,000 an outlier. Though the likes of Fox have framed the protests as an organic grassroots push, a good number have been organized through a network of Facebook pages that appear to have been launched by a right-wing activist family known for using pro-gun and anti-abortion social media posts to harvest data, per reports from the Washington Post and NBC News. Aaron, Ben, Chris, and Matthew Dorr are reportedly behind pages that have accumulated more than 200,000 members in total, such as New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine and Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine. However, given FacebookтАЩs newly announced ban on groups advocating for social distancing violations, itтАЩs unclear how much longer these groups will be allowed to exist on the platform. The family declined requests for comment from NBC News and the Post, but Ben Dorr called accusations of them running a scam operation тАЬfake newsтАЭ in a response to the Philadelphia Inquirer. In one of the DorrsтАЩ most successful pushes, over 100,000 Facebook users have joined a Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantines group, and at least 300 of those members RSVPтАЩd for an тАЬOperation GridlockтАЭ protest next week. (The groupтАЩs creator, Ben Dorr, lives in Iowa, NBC News found.) The scheduled rally is a rip-off of MichiganтАЩs тАЬOperation Gridlock,тАЭ which was staged by a group backed by the billionaire family of TrumpтАЩs education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Trump blamed the governors for instigating the backlash, casting their shutdown policies as extreme, even though many are in accordance with recommendations from the White HouseтАЩs own Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. тАЬIf people feel that way, youтАЩre allowed to protest. Some governors have gone too far, some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate,тАЭ he told reporters on Sunday. When Chuck Todd pressed Mike Pence about TrumpтАЩs protest cheerleadingтАФтАЬWhy is the president trying to undermine the guidance youтАЩve been laying out?тАЭтАФPence deflected. тАЬI donтАЩt accept your premise,тАЭ he said, тАЬand I donтАЩt think most Americans do either.тАЭ тАФ Does the King of the Coronavirus Contrarians Have a Case?тАФ In the COVID-19 Crisis, Warren Buffett Is Lying LowтАФAnd Bill Ackman Stepping UpтАФ Can You Beat COVID-19 Without a Lockdown?

3151,Hundreds gather to protest Harris County face mask order,"LIVE Phil Archer, Reporter Published: April 23, 2020 8:01 pm Phil Archer, Reporter HOUSTON тАУ Hundreds of protestors expressed their anger toward Harris County Judge Lina HidalgoтАЩs order requiring all county residents to wear face masks in public. The large group gathered outside the Harris County Administration Building in downtown Houston Wednesday. The protest, similar to others taking place across the country, highlighted the growing tension between personal liberty and public health in a time of national crisis. About 200 people carrying signs, flags and bull horns gathered on the sidewalk. тАЬIтАЩm tired of the government trying to tell us what to do,"""" said protestor Marga Matthews. The protest was organized by longtime conservative activist Dr. Steven Hotze and attorney Jared Woodfill, the former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. They also filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to block the order requiring all county residents to wear face masks, to wash their hands, and to not touch their faces for 30 days on pain of a one thousand dollars fine. Their lawsuit contends Judge HidalgoтАЩs order is unconstitutional and an overreach of her power. тАЬThe order that weтАЩre dealing with right now we believe is an unconstitutional, trampling and infringement on our liberties,тАЭ Woodfill said. тАЬThis is one individual who is dictating from her office over there on Preston as to what we can or canтАЩt do.тАЭ In opposition, the county attorney says the Texas Constitution gives the judge broad power during an emergency to implement public health measures such as quarantine and the wearing of face masks. тАЬThereтАЩs no constitutional right not to wash your hands; no constitutional right during a pandemic to be allowed to spread a deadly virus to other people,"""" Assistant Harris County Attorney Seth Hopkins said. тАЬItтАЩs reasonable, during this transition phase, to ask people to cover their mouths. Similar laws were declared constitutional during the 1918 pandemic. They were constitutional then, theyтАЩre constitutional today.тАЭ The judgeтАЩs order follows recommendations from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already being followed in Dallas and Bexar counties. Other Texas counties, like Galveston and Montgomery counties are opposing the measure on constitutional grounds. But medical experts like Dr. Joseph Varon who treat virus victims at the United Memorial Medical Center in north Houston say requiring face masks makes sense. тАЬSome of my own friends are not happy with this idea.тАЭ Dr. Varon said. тАЬThis is a measure that may prevent more spreading of the COVID. As it is right now, weтАЩre still in a crisis, weтАЩre still not over this hump. And this will prevent more cases."""" Copyright 2020 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.

3256,Washington anglers protest coronavirus fishing closure,"Protest planned Sunday in Olympia, Washington RICHLAND, Wash. -- Protesters in boats and on shore Saturday demanded that restrictions on recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting in Washington because of the coronavirus be lifted.About 50 boats along with several hundred protesters on shore gathered on Saturday around Columbia Point Marina in Richland in southeastern Washington. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife on March 25 temporarily closed recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.But the protesters say the restrictions should be lifted because anglers can practice social distancing while fishing. They said kayakers, jet skis, wake boarders, pleasure boaters and others are on the water.тАЬThereтАЩs nobody but us two out in the middle of the river,тАЭ Alan Doughty told the Tri-City Herald. He was on their boat in the Columbia River with Pam Doughty and their two dogs. """"WeтАЩve got a $60,000 boat. We have I donтАЩt know how much in gear. WeтАЩve got a fishing license. WeтАЩve got insurance, and we canтАЩt use it,тАЭBen Hanes organized the protest after noticing non-fishing boaters on the water and believed the restrictions on fishing were unfair.тАЬThe anglers of Washington state arenтАЩt going to put up with (the ban) much longer,тАЭ he said.Al Bernicker, 74, regularly comes to Columbia Point to fish. This time he brought a sign that said, тАЬI can sit here. Why not fish here.

Angry demonstrators took to the streets in North Carolina and Missouri on Tuesday to voice their discontent at their statesтАЩ stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. The protests in Raleigh, N.C. and Jefferson City, Mo., are the latest in a series of protests across the country against state lockdown orders тАУ fueled by tweets of support from President Trump and the economic unease caused by the coronavirus. Holding handmade signs with slogans like тАЬMy Rights Are EssentialтАЭ and тАЬReOpenNC,тАЭ hundreds of people marched through downtown Raleigh while chanting тАЬFreedom Now.тАЭ Most of the people at the protest were not wearing masks and were ignoring orders to maintain social distancing practices. Similar signs along with a slew of American flags were seen as people began to gather outside the Missouri Capitol building, although the protestors seemed to be trying to maintain better social distancing than in North Carolina. Protests against the lockdown orders have cropped up in numerous states over the past few weeks as some Americans have become frustrated with being told to stay at home and with the economic freefall the virus has caused. The federal government said Thursday that 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the four-week total to about 22 million out of a work force of 159 million тАФ easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record. The losses translate to about one in seven workers. Last week, hundreds of cars, trucks and SUVs descended on MichiganтАЩs state capital Wednesday afternoon as part of a noisy protest against Democratic Gov. Gretchen WhitmerтАЩs social-distancing restrictions that critics say have gone too far. The same day, a number of people gathered outside the Kentucky Capitol building to protest Gov. Andy BeshearтАЩs shutdown orders, while more gathered in Virginia to protest on Thursday. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Several hundred people rallied in Texas' capital over the weekend, chanting тАЬLet us work!тАЭ Many clamored for an immediate lifting of restrictions in a state where more than 1 million have filed for unemployment since the crisis began. The rally was organized by a host of Infowars, owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who joined protesters on the Capitol steps. Jones is being sued in Austin over using his show to promote falsehoods that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut was a hoax. In Indianapolis, more than 200 people stood close together outside the governor's mansion, carrying American flags and signs demanding that Gov. Holcomb lift restrictions. Indiana's state health department reported 529 new cases between April 7 and midday Friday, raising the total to more than 10,600. The number of deaths rose by 26, to 545. Elsewhere, a few hundred demonstrators waved signs outside the Statehouse in New Hampshire, which has had nearly 1,300 cases of the virus and more than three dozen deaths. More protests this week are planned in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin. TRUMP тАШFOMENTING DOMESTIC REBELLION,тАЩ DEM GOVERNOR INSLEE SAYS While many governors have pleaded with their constituents to not protest during the public health crisis as it may only cause more people to get sick, the demonstrations тАУ mainly organized by conservative groups тАУ have found an ally in the president. тАЬLIBERATE MINNESOTA!тАЭ тАЬLIBERATE MICHIGAN!тАЭ тАЬLIBERATE VIRGINIA,тАЭ Trump said in a tweet-storm in over the weekend in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Four states тАУ Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas тАУ already have lifted some restrictions or plan to this week. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, gave the green light for some outdoor areas in the state to reopen late last week even as he cautioned that social distancing guidelines should remain in place. Florida has been one of the stateтАЩs hardest hit by the contagion, with almost 26,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 764 deaths. The state was one of the last in the nation to order a lockdown and was heavily criticized for leaving beaches open during part of the spring break period last month. But by late Friday afternoon, thousands of people flooded the beaches in places like Jacksonville after they reopened despite pleas from mayors to practice safe social distancing measures. In nearby South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is set to announce on Monday the reopening of state beaches and some retail stores. McMaster already reinstated last Friday access to public boat ramps and landings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced over the weekend that state parks will reopen for recreational activity on Monday, so long as citizens wear masks and maintain a distance of six feet from each other. Subsequent measures will allow hospitals to resume elective tests and surgeries while stores can start тАЬretail to goтАЭ services, starting on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Despite the protests and opening up of some states, many lawmakers and public health officials warn that the country is far from safe when it comes to dealing with the virus. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has recorded more than 788,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that over 39,000 people in the country have died for the disease. Public Health officials have said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of the infected is crucial before easing restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.

3542,The Extremists And Grifters Behind Many Of The Anti-Lockdown Protests,"Many of the right-wing protests against state stay-at-home orders sweeping the nation have been organized or attended by white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, anti-government militias, members of a neo-fascist street gang, and other assorted extremists and scam artists, a HuffPost analysis shows. The protests, largely coordinated on Facebook, have seen crowds of hundreds descend upon state and city government buildings, where participants flagrantly flout social distancing guidelines to demand that their respective governors reopen state businesses during a deadly pandemic. Images of these often heavily armed protesters, screaming at health care workers and blocking ambulances from reaching hospitals, have gone viral, shocking a country where polls show a large majority support measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has already killed over 45,000 people in this country. Yet the events тАФ which present a clear danger to communities across the U.S., risking the further spread of a virus тАФ have been promoted extensively by Fox News. On Friday, immediately after a Fox segment sympathetic to the rallies, the president tweeted out his support for the protesters. тАЬLIBERATE MINNESOTA!тАЭ тАЬLIBERATE MICHIGAN!тАЭ тАЬLIBERATE VIRGINIA,тАЭ Trump wrote in a tweet-storm, directly contradicting the advice of the medical experts on his own COVID-19 task force. ItтАЩs easy to see why footage of the protests might excite the president. They bear a striking resemblance, after all, to his own fascist campaign rallies, with attendees who are almost uniformly white, and who display a deep devotion to the president, donning red MAGA hats and waving Trump 2020 flags. And like TrumpтАЩs rallies, the anti-shutdown protests are teeming with right-wing extremists. HereтАЩs a brief look at some of the figures who have either organized or attended these events over the last week. A rally Monday in Augusta, the state capital of Maine, was organized in part by Larry Lockman, a white nationalist former state lawmaker who in 2017 warned that proposed immigrant welcome centers were tantamount to a тАЬwar on whites.тАЭ According to Maine-based journalist Nathan Bernard, Lockman helped coordinate MondayтАЩs anti-shutdown event on the тАЬMainers Against Excessive QuarantineтАЭ Facebook page, where he encouraged attendees to show up to the rally wearing MAGA gear. тАЬThis is about the loss of our civil rights and its impact on our businesses and religion,тАЭ he wrote in one post. Bernard reported seeing Lockman coordinating a group of unmasked protesters at the rally Monday. In Columbus, Ohio, two men were photographed at an anti-shutdown protest holding up an anti-Semitic sign depicting Jews as rats, calling them тАЬthe real plague.тАЭ The Anti-Defamation LeagueтАЩs Center on Extremism believes one of the men belongs to the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. According to the ADL, this individual was photographed at a 2019 white power rally with Timothy Wilson, who was killed by federal agents last month during an attempted arrest over his alleged plot to bomb a Missouri hospital during the pandemic in order to attract attention to his white supremacist views. A тАЬReopen FloridaтАЭ protest scheduled for this weekend in Miami was organized by a leader of the neo-fascist street gang The Proud Boys, the Miami New Times reported this week. Enrique Tarrio, a longtime Proud Boy, admitted to the New Times that heтАЩd organized the rally, which heтАЩs advertised as being тАЬagainst the Democrat-driven unconstitutional lockdown.тАЭ Members of the Proud Boys тАФ a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group originally founded by bigot Gavin McInnes тАФ have deep ties to a host of white nationalist and militia groups, and are best known for violently attacking their political opponents. Proud Boys have also been spotted at anti-shutdown protests in Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan. At the rally in Lansing, Michigan, Proud Boys were allegedly among the attendees blocking ambulances from being able to reach a hospital. Also in Michigan тАФ as noted by reporter Jason Wilson in The Guardian тАФ were members of the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page Wilson notes тАЬfeatures pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front.тАЭ An April 19 rally in Olympia, Washington, was well-attended by other anti-government militia groups, including the Oathkeepers and Three Percenters, whose members have been implicated in multiple anti-Muslim terror plots in recent years. Matt Marshall, leader of a state chapter of the Three Percenters, encouraged attendees ahead of the Olympia rally to wear Hawaiian shirts, a reference to the тАЬBig Luau,тАЭ which is itself code for the тАЬboogaloo,тАЭ a term used in white supremacist, militia and far-right circles to describe the bloody civil war they predict тАФ and often hope тАФ is coming to America. According to the ADL, anti-shutdown protesters in Tennessee and New Hampshire have been spotted holding up signs invoking the boogaloo. тАЬLiberty or Boogaloo,тАЭ the signs have said, and тАЬJoin my boog squad.тАЭ In San Diego, an anti-shutdown protest this past Saturday was organized by Roger Ogden, who has previously held a series of far-right rallies in the city in coordination with the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters. тАЬWe do not believe that the COVID-19 bug represents such an immediate danger to others that constitutional rights should be curtailed,тАЭ Ogden told reporters at the San Diego rally, downplaying the virus as less severe than the flu. (COVID-19 is thought to be 10 times more deadly than the flu.) And in Idaho, rally scheduled for this Friday outside the state capital building in Boise is being advertised by Diego Rodriguez, a pastor and former Republican candidate for the state senate. Rodriguez recently held an Easter Sunday church service тАФ in defiance of social distancing orders in the state тАФ with Ammon Bundy, who led the militia occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. Anti-vaccination extremists, a mainstay of Trump rallies and other far-right events in recent years, have been seen at multiple anti-shutdown protests. An April 14 rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, was organized in part by an anti-vaccination activist named Ashley Smith. тАЬI am against mandatory vaccination,тАЭ Smith said in an email to The News & Observer. тАЬThat is a personal right and as a sovereign citizen I have the right to choose what medical procedures I and my children receive. Pandemic status/state of emergency doesnтАЩt change that.тАЭ Public health experts fear the anti-vaxx movement could, once a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, undermine a national inoculation program.

Owen Shroyer, a host on the conspiracy website Infowars, held a тАЬYou CanтАЩt Close AmericaтАЭ rally in the Texas state capitol last weekend, attracting hundreds of attendees. When Infowars founder Alex Jones arrived with a bullhorn, fans swarmed around him and jostled to shake his hand as Jones declared that the pandemic тАФ which has already killed over 500 people in Texas тАФ is a hoax. Investigations by The Washington Post and NBC News revealed that some of the largest Facebook groups organizing protests across the country were all founded by four brothers with a history exploiting far-right causes to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Dorr brothers тАФ Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew тАФ were the founders or administrators of the groups New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine, Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine, Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine and Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine. According to NBC News, the groups started or administered by the brothers, which have amassed some 200,000 members, direct people to websites owned by the Dorrs, which then directs people to register their names and addresses, or to sign up as dues-paying members for organizations promoting pro-gun, anti-abortion, or pro-Trump causes. But Republicans who have previously crossed paths with the Dorr brothers warn that such fundraisers have little to do with political organizing and more to do with lining the DorrsтАЩ pockets. MinnesotaтАЩs Senate Republican Caucus earlier this year warned voters about these Dorr тАЬscams.тАЭ And Minnesota Citizens Concerned For Life, a prominent anti-abortion group, states on its website that the тАЬDorr brothers are established scam artists.тАЭ тАЬNothing they say can be believed,тАЭ the website says, тАЬand giving them your money will not advance the pro-life cause in any way.тАЭ A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus Stay up to date with our live blog as we cover the COVID-19 pandemic What happens if we end social distancing too soon?

Florida's higher-speed passenger rail service Brightline announced Tuesday it will resume operating sometime in November, 20 months after it closed because of the pandemic and with safety measures that it hopes will curb a spate of fatal collisions that plagued its initial run. The privately run company, which began operations in 2017, will resume with hourly service between Miami and West Palm Beach, president Patrick Goddard said. Goddard said Brightline will require all employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, following federal regulations, mandate masks for crew and passengers inside its trains and stations.

In parts of the U.S., you might have to carry your COVID-19 vaccine card or a digital copy to get into restaurants, bars, nightclubs and outdoor music festivals. After resisting the divisive concept of vaccine passports through most of the pandemic, a fast-growing number of private venues and some local officials are now requiring proof of immunization in public settings to reduce the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus тАФ and to assuage wary customers. It's unlikely the U.S. will adopt a national mandate like the one in France, which on Monday began requiring people to show a QR code proving they have a special virus pass before they can enjoy restaurants and cafes or travel across the country. Burke, Virginia residents are surprised to learn that they may be overpaying for auto insurance New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned, citing a need for the state to move on from the sexual harassment scandal that has engulfed his administration. At a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Cuomo continued to deny many of the accusations of unwanted physical contact with women, before explaining that the situation had consumed the stateтАЩs attention while officials battled a resurgence of Covid-19. The stateтАЩs attorney general, Letitia James, previously released a report finding that sexual harassment accusations against the governor from nearly a dozen women were credible. Gov.

3616,"'A riot is the language of the unheard,' Martin Luther King Jr. explained 53 years ago","Echoes Screenshot/Twitter/The King Center Rioting and looting isn't new in America тАФ and it isn't exclusive to any race. As areas of Minneapolis shifted from peaceful protest against the death of George Floyd to looting, arson, and vandalism on Wednesday and Thursday night, the King Center тАФ founded by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow to promote MLK Jr.'s """"nonviolent philosophy and methodology"""" тАФ posted this excerpt from King's 1967 """"The Other America"""" speech at Stanford University. Speaking two years after California's Watts riots in August 1965 and race riots in Harlem the previous summer, King spent a few minutes trying to explain the cause of rioting to his predominantly white audience. тАЬIn the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?тАЭ pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH America has consistently """"taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality"""" only to follow it with """"certain backward steps,"""" King said. Because of widespread and widely ignored black poverty and racial injustice, """"all of our cities are potentially powder kegs,"""" he added, and """"many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots."""" King continued: Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. ... But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.

But we cannot give this man back to his family.тАЭ By Molly Hensley-Clancy Last updated on May 29, 2020, at 3:57 p.m. ET Posted on May 29, 2020, at 2:52 p.m. ET The ashes of the Gandhi Mahal restaurant are seen behind police in South Minneapolis on Friday morning. The first thing Hafsa Islam felt Friday morning, when she woke up in a neighborhood filled with acrid smoke, was anger. The restaurant in South Minneapolis that had been her familyтАЩs lifeтАЩs work, Gandhi Mahal, had burned down in protests early Friday morning, days after George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Then Hafsa heard her father, Ruhel Islam, on the phone. тАЬLet the buildings burn,тАЭ he was saying. тАЬJustice needs to be served. Put those officers in jail.тАЭ Hearing her fatherтАЩs words on the phone calmed Hafsa, who said she has always supported the Black Lives Matter movement. тАЬIt helped me realize what we were there for,тАЭ she said. тАЬIt has gotten to a point where this is the only way that we can get justice, and we can change the system.тАЭ Hafsa, 18, posted what her father had said on Gandhi MahalтАЩs Facebook page, hoping to help others understand why there were more important things at stake in the protests than buildings, she said. She was met with an outpouring of support from the community and promises to help the restaurant rebuild. Ruhel, an immigrant from Bangladesh, explained it this way: тАЬLife is more valuable than anything else,тАЭ he said, hours after his restaurant had burned. тАЬWe can rebuild a building. But we cannot give this man back to his family.тАЭ News OтАЩClock is your daily look at whatтАЩs going on out there in the world beyond your quranteam. Catch up on all the episodes or subscribe on Apple Podcasts, the iHeart Radio app, Spotify, Google Podcasts, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows. In the wake of FloydтАЩs death, Hafsa had spent the past few days at Gandhi Mahal, which sits just a few blocks from the Minneapolis PoliceтАЩs Third Precinct, in the heart of the neighborhood that has been the epicenter of the protests. She had seen medics carrying people injured in the protests. SheтАЩd seen nonviolent protesters stung by tear gas and rubber bullets. And she had even, she said, caught a glimpse of George Floyd as he was arrested a few blocks away. She was in her car, running DoorDash orders from her familyтАЩs restaurant. She even filmed a 5-second video on Snapchat, a blurry video showing police with a man on the corner where Floyd was arrested. тАЬThe first thing I noticed was his facial expression,тАЭ Hafsa said. тАЬIt brought that image to my mind. I remembered how he was crying and in pain.тАЭ She has thought of that expression, she said, as she watches the protests unfold in her city. тАЬI think the people saying that people should stop protesting are wrong,тАЭ she said. The boarded up storefront of Moon Palace books, which was tagged with """"Do Not Burn."""" As the protests and violence that erupted over FloydтАЩs death have reduced much of the south Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd was arrested to rubble, many have used the plight of small business owners as a cudgel against the protesters. To Ruhel, who grew up in a тАЬpolice stateтАЭ in Bangladesh, the forces that brought down his beloved restaurant were very clear. He places the blame on city leaders and local law enforcement who had failed to arrest the officers involved in FloydтАЩs death, before the officer who knelt on FloydтАЩs neck was charged with murder Friday afternoon. The other three officers have not been charged. тАЬThey could have stopped this,тАЭ Ruhel said. тАЬThey need to put the police in jail. It should have been solved two, three days ago.тАЭ Other small business owners in Minneapolis have gone out of their way to support the protests, even with their buildings at risk as tensions continue to rise. The owners of Moon Palace, a local bookstore, condemned тАЬindifference, violence, and more terrorizing by the policeтАЭ in response to FloydтАЩs death. тАЬWe so appreciate all of the support weтАЩve been offered over the past two days, but we urge you: do not put yourself at risk to protect our store,тАЭ they wrote on Facebook. тАЬThe things that may be lost in our building are just things, but your life is priceless, just like George FloydтАЩs life was priceless.тАЭ Moon Palace's large glass windows were boarded up and tagged with """"Do Not Burn"""" after reports emerged that the owners had refused to allow police to stage operations in their parking lot. Hafsa Islam and Ruhel Islam, in their garden. None of this, though, has lessened the pain of the loss of Gandhi Mahal, for Ruhel or for Hafsa. Ruhel tried to protect his building, he said: He stayed there this morning until 1 a.m., when he finally had no choice but to go home. тАЬMy heart is very broken,тАЭ he said of the damage done to his restaurant. тАЬWe want justice for our brother, but we donтАЩt want to be destroyed. I see young people's anger. At the end, we believe in peace.тАЭ On Friday, Ruhel tried to examine the damage done to their restaurant. But police were blocking off the streets, he said, and he couldnтАЩt get through. Around him, rubble still smoked. Instead, Ruhel and Hafsa went to the garden that they started nearby, called the Interfaith Garden, where Ruhel has long worked with other community groups to grow fresh vegetables and spices that are served at Gandhi Mahal. Ruhel tended to cilantro, beans, and fenugreek, a medicinal spice. Around them, the smoke was still so heavy that their throats burned. тАЬIтАЩm going to plant in the garden and pray for everyone,тАЭ Ruhel said. He has told Hafsa not to worry about the loss of their restaurant, which was their main source of income. тАЬWeтАЩll figure it out, donтАЩt worry, weтАЩll work together,тАЭ he said he told her. тАЬWeтАЩre growing a lot of food, vegetables, and IтАЩm not worried.

Fires have sprung up around the area as well. Gov. Tim Walz tweeted late Wednesday night, calling the situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue an """"extremely dangerous situation."""" The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone's safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene. The protests are happening in response to the death of George Floyd, who was killed Monday night after an incident that involved Minneapolis Police officers. All four officers involved in the arrest were fired on Tuesday. Protesters were seen on Chopper 5 footage throwing bottles and rocks at law enforcement, while officers responded with rubber bullets, flash bombs and tear gas to push them back. Some looters at the East Lake Street Target location were seen walking out with televisions, rugs and other items from the store. Other looters were seen at a tobacco store, a Dollar Tree and a liquor store. Additionally, Cub Foods and an AutoZone is being looted as well. The AutoZone was set on fire as of 9:30 p.m. It could be seen burning on Chopper 5 video. A source has confirmed to KSTP that the city requested support from the National Guard late Wednesday night to combat the ongoing violent protests. A Target spokesperson made the following statement: """"We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing our community. We decided to close our Lake Street store earlier today and worked to ensure all of our team members were accounted for and safe. Our focus will remain on our team membersтАЩ safety and helping our community heal. Until further notice, our store will remain closed."""" KSTP has a crew on scene to gather more information. The Minneapolis Police Department said they are aware of what is happening in the area and are working on the matter. They advise all to stay out of the area for the time being. Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith shared her thoughts on the night's protests. IтАЩm praying for peace and healing tonight in Minneapolis, as I hear sirens and explosions across our green city. Our community is in so much pain. Dr. King said, тАЬI can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love.тАЭ Metro Transit has announced that Routes 5 and 23 are being detoured around the area. Walz also posted a series of tweets earlier Wednesday night calling on people to be peaceful if they choose to protest. If you plan to turn your pain into action by joining a public demonstration, please do so peacefully and safely to protect your own health and the health of the people around you. ThatтАЩs why IтАЩm pushing for a full, fair, and expeditious investigation that will bring us closer to justice. We must continue to examine and address the systemic inequities and discrimination that led to this incident and far too many that have come before. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted a statement urging others to keep the peace. Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 Minneapolis Senators Jeff Hayden and Patricia Torres Ray also made a joint statement on Thursday saying: """"We, along with our constituents, are deeply heartbroken and outraged by the injustice that occurred in the officer-involved death of George Floyd. As our community continues to grieve and grapple with this incredibly unjustifiable loss of life, we believe in their right to peacefully protest. We have grown increasingly concerned, for the safety of the City of Minneapolis and its residents, as the demonstration has escalated. More than ever, our community must come together during this hard time and in this work to fiercely advocate for the justice that is needed.

By Lam Thuy Vo Posted on May 31, 2020, at 4:09 p.m. ET A journalist is seen bleeding after police started firing tear gas and rubber bullets in Minneapolis on Saturday. As protests against police brutality continue around the country, more than a dozen journalists have been injured and arrested by police officers while working. Protests broke out in Minneapolis, then spread around the country, after George Floyd died Monday when a police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Floyd's pleas for his life, saying тАЬI canтАЩt breathe,тАЭ in an event that was captured on video echoed the killing of Eric Garner and brought renewed attention to the violence people of color face from police. Since then, journalists have been documenting the crowds of thousands who have gathered in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Seattle. тАЬTargeted attacks on journalists, media crews, and news organizations covering the demonstrations show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them,тАЭ said Carlos Mart├нnez de la Serna of the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement condemning police actions. тАЬAuthorities in cities across the U.S. need to instruct police not to target journalists and ensure they can report safely on the protests without fear of injury or retaliation.тАЭ Below are some of the injuries and arrests that have been captured through videos and images. Minneapolis Journalists from several news organizations have reported on social media that police have either arrested, harassed, or fired upon them with less-than-lethal force while covering ongoing protests.

Regardless of the intent, this seems to be a much smarter strategy than shooting the streets up with teargas. Chattanooga Chief of Police David Roddy made a post on Twitter saying that police officers who donтАЩt have an issue with what happened to George Floyd should turn in their badges. There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how тАЬit plays outтАЭ. There is no need to put a knee on someoneтАЩs neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you donтАЩt have an issue with thisтАжturn it in. pic.twitter.com/frNCAWCeq6 тАФ David Roddy (@ChiefDavidRoddy) May 27, 2020  The protests that have spread around the country in recent weeks are in response to the police killing of George Floyd. The Minneapolis police arrested officer Derek Chavin in hopes to quell the protests, but the demonstrations have continued and expanded throughout the country. Chauvin is the recently fired officer who was seen in the now-viral video in which Floyd was killed. Chauvin kneeled on FloydтАЩs neck for several minutes as he gasped for air and begged for his life. He has been with the Minneapolis Police Department for 19 years, and in that time, he has been involved in multiple shootings in which people were killed, and has had multiple excessive force complaints during his career. The case has become so controversial because of the blatant use of force shown in the footage, but also because the evidence shows that Floyd was entirely complaint and peaceful throughout the arrest, and that there was no reason to be so forceful with him. The incident is such a flashpoint across the country because it has become a symbol of the experiences that so many other people in the country have with police. Police initially said Floyd was resisting arrest and had a medical incident. However, surveillance video obtained by CBS News showed Floyd cooperating with the officers, and video of his death clearly shows that he was not resisting. The videos to initially surface of the incident showed the moments where officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the ground with his knee on FloydтАЩs neck. In those videos, Floyd was not fighting or struggling with the officers at all, but police claimed that he was resisting after he was first taken out of his car. Now, surveillance camera footage that was released from a nearby restaurant shows Floyd being removed from his car by police without resisting. The new video shows him being taken from the car and placed in handcuffs, which means that he had no opportunity to resist. ",1,3,1,3
3776,Anti-Lockdown Protests Originated With Tight-Knit Group Who Share Bigger Goal: Trump 2020 | Snopes.com,"Organizers of тАЬOperation Gridlock,тАЭ the first significant protest against the lockdown measures issued by state governments in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, urged participants to remain in their vehicles as they halted traffic around the Capitol Building in Lansing, Michigan, on April 15, 2020. Two weeks later, alongside many of the same people who promoted those actions, protesters not only left their cars but entered that building, flanked by armed militias demanding that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer open the government and allow residents the freedom to return to work. Competing narratives have emerged surrounding this anti-lockdown movement, which has spread across the country and increasingly come to embrace anti-government conspiracy theories, dangerous pseudoscience, and occasional threats or acts of violence. To its supporters, the movement represents a grassroots expression of patriotic discontent over unconstitutional measures that infringe on liberty and cause economic hardship. To its detractors, the movement inflates perceived opposition to life-saving public health measures with help from dark money tied to the family of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Several media reports have previously linked Operation Gridlock to the influential DeVos family through an organization tangentially funded by them, which purchased $250 in Facebook advertisements to promote the April 15 event. While this connection is largely factual, it is quantitatively negligible and, more importantly, misses the bigger picture. By combining a sometimes second-by-second chronology of which users shared Facebook invites to the protests with hundreds of pages of campaign-finance records and local news reports, Snopes demonstrates that this anti-lockdown movement was originally pushed by a small circle of fervent activists who have been protesting almost constantly since well before the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, they have benefited from a political action infrastructure originally created to support the DeVos-funded, anti-union тАЬright-to-workтАЭ movement. These methods have apparently created the perception of widespread discontent with public health measures largely supported by the American populace and are part of a campaign playbook self-evidently resulting in an increasingly radicalized base of Trump supporters as the 2020 general election approaches. Betsy DeVosтАЩ family тАФ whose wealth stems from father-in-law Richard DeVosтАЩ success in creating and running the multi-level marketing company Amway тАФ has financed libertarian political causes with an influence comparable to the Koch brothersтАЩ for decades. The children of Richard DeVos, Sr. and their families, through at least five separate foundations, generally provide much of this financial support in a coordinated way as a family unit. To get a sense of the scale of their political involvement, note that in 2015 and 2016 the DeVos family made $14 million in political contributions, including substantial funding to the Michigan state Republican Party and other county-level GOP chapters. The link between the DeVoses and the Operation Gridlock event stems from the formerтАЩs support of an independent PAC, the Michigan Freedom Network, which received a combined $250,000 from five members of the Devos family on March 18, 2020. The Michigan Freedom Network owns and operates the website of the Michigan Freedom Fund, a political non-profit. The Michigan Freedom Network shares staff, finances, and other resources with both the Freedom Fund and with the DeVos-funded Great Lakes Education Project, which is an тАЬadvocacy organization supporting quality choices in public education.тАЭ The Michigan Freedom Fund, whose executive director is lobbyist Tony Daunt, was a co-host of the first Operation Gridlock event on Facebook. By email, Daunt told us the fund spent only $250 on Facebook ads to promote the protest. DeVos family spokesman Nick Wasmiller told us by email that the purpose of the DeVos family donations to the Michigan Freedom Network, which occurred in the same amount in 2016 and 2018, has always been to support candidates for state-level office, and that the money has always been earmarked for that and no other purpose: тАЬLike the Michigan Freedom Network, the DeVos family advocates for policies that support a fair and open economy, accountable government, strong individual rights and opportunity for all. These shared principles have inspired DeVos family members тАУ like many other Michigan residents тАУ to periodically make contributions to MFN with the latest coming earlier this year. These contributions are restricted to support of state house candidates who are seeking office in the coming election cycle.тАЭ Since 2015, the Michigan Freedom Network has participated in at least 60 different state-level campaigns, but the assertion that the DeVos money does not go toward the fund тАФ which received $51,032 from the Network between 2015 and 2018 тАФ is unverifiable. In terms of direct financial support for this protest, however, the most one could reasonably argue might have come from the DeVoses via the Network would be $250 for Facebook ads. The Freedom Fund itself has minimized its connection to the Operation Gridlock protest as well. тАЬThe April 15 Operation Gridlock protest in Lansing was organized by a different organization тАФ one unaffiliated with the Michigan Freedom Fund тАФ called the Michigan Conservative Coalition,тАЭ Daunt told us. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is a collection of former Tea Party-aligned groups and pro-Trump organizations whose purpose is to recruit and train an тАЬarmy of conservative activists,тАЭ most notably the groups Michigan Trump Republicans, Women for Trump, and the Lakes Area TEA Party. The people who run the coalition have deep ties to the Michigan GOP and to Trump campaign surrogates, and the coalition was founded by Meshawn Maddock and Marian Sheridan. Maddock is the wife of Republican state Rep. Matt Maddock and serves on the national advisory board for the group Woman for Trump. Sheridan is grassroots vice chair of the Michigan Republican Party and was a founding member of the Lakes Area TEA Party. Another Coalition leader, Rosanne Ponkowski, has served as co-chair of the Oakland County (Michigan) Republican Party. The separation between the Michigan Freedom Fund and the Michigan Conservative Coalition is not as clear as Daunt has claimed. Individuals from both organizations frequently collaborate on shared goals. Members of both organizations, for example, have been deeply invested in getting conservative members on the Michigan redistricting commission, which was created to limit political gamesmanship in the process of drawing new congressional districts in that state. Daunt, of the Michigan Freedom Fund, and Sheridan, of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, were both involved in a (failed) legal challenge against the Michigan secretary of state that criticized rules barring several individuals linked to the Michigan Conservative Coalition from serving on that redistricting commission. Eric Doster, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, is the husband of Mary Doster, who is the treasurer of the Michigan Freedom Network. To test the theory that grassroots leaders connected to or trained by these organizations were responsible for the bulk of the early promotion of the Michigan anti-lockdown protests on Facebook that helped launch a nationwide movement, we created a database of all of the people and Facebook pages who shared invites to early Michigan lockdown protests. This research revealed a tightly knit community of political activists that has been protesting since well before the COVID-19 pandemic. This activist cohort uses a political action infrastructure linked to the 2012-era, anti-union right-to-work movement in Michigan, which occurred principally due to massive political spending by the DeVoses. We used the analytics tool Crowdtangle to collect a database of information on nearly 1,000 separate instances in which a Facebook account shared a lockdown-protest event page to a Facebook group in April 2020. We collected information from 39 different lockdown events across the country identified by key search terms, Facebook-recommended related events, and a list of protests advertised on the website of the libertarian-aligned group FreedomWorks (which has previously been supported by the DeVos family). The resulting report here concerns only data derived from Michigan, but the entire raw dataset, which includes other states, can be viewed here. The information produced by this process aligns with previously reported aspects of the lockdown protestтАЩs suspicious social media behavior. For example, the largest and most frequently used groups to spread these events were ones created by the Dorr brothers, four pro-gun activists. They created several anti-quarantine groups and associated websites тАФ including Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine тАФ days before Operation Gridlock, which attracted hundreds of thousands of people, as reported by the Washington Post and NBC News. What our dataset adds to this discussion is an intricate chronology of the Michigan lockdown movementтАЩs promotion on Facebook, allowing for the identification of a small group of activists who first pushed the protestsтАЩ online promotion and who subsequently received a disproportionate amount of media coverage. Our first step was to sort all instances of people sharing protest event pages chronologically. Doing so allowed us to view тАЬburstsтАЭ of shares тАФ times when a Facebook user either copy-and-pasted several invites to multiple groups manually, or times when, some of these Facebook users later told us, they used a recently allowed method for automatically posting to multiple Facebook groups at once. Joan Donovan, an online extremism expert and the research director of HarvardтАЩs Shorenstein Center, told us that Facebook groups have been the backbone of protest movements going back to the Occupy Wall Street movement of the 2010тАЩs, and that this multiple-post feature can be a powerful messaging tool for activists. тАЬIt works really well in memetic warfare campaigns because you can post the same meme to a bunch of different groups,тАЭ she told us in a phone interview. We term these multi-posters тАЬboosters,тАЭ which we defined as an account that shared the same event to at least four groups separated by no more than 60 seconds. In our dataset, these instances are highlighted in yellow. The first two boosters who met this criterion were Rob Cortis and Cindi Holland. Via Facebook messenger and email, we reached out to Holland, who asked us to send questions by email but provided no response to our questions when we did. Via his website, we reached out to Cortis, who told us by email to contact him by phone but provided us with an incorrect number. A follow-up email with a list of questions had not been responded to as of this writing. Cortis is a well-known figure in Trump circles. One could argue he is equal parts activist and self-contained traveling side show, who since October 2016 has toured the country with a parade-style float dubbed the тАЬTrump Unity Bridge.тАЭ A literal bridge on a trailer, this float is adorned with various Trump slogans and American flag iconography. Cortis and the bridge have become a fixture of Trump rallies and protests. Though he mostly supports his unity tour through donations, at least one political campaign has paid him. In 2017 and 2018, Cortis received $6,398.20 from the (unsuccessful) gubernatorial campaign of former Michigan state Sen. Pat Colbeck as reimbursement for тАЬrental equipment.тАЭ  Holland, the second person in our database to promote Operation Gridlock to multiple groups, is the campaign director for a current political campaign, Mike Detmer for Congress. Detmer organized one of the caravans that traveled to Lansing for Operation Gridlock. This fact was noted in several publications because he briefly went viral for appearing in a photograph with a very non-social-distanced group of people that included a member of the Proud Boys flashing a тАЬwhite powerтАЭ symbol during the caravan meet-up. As of this writing, his campaign has received endorsements from two individuals: former Milwaukee County sheriff and current Trump surrogate David Clarke, and the aforementioned Cortis benefactor Colbeck. Another frequent booster of several Michigan lockdown protests was Londa Gatt, who serves as the grassroots director for the Detmer campaign and also as Midwest regional director for the pro-Trump organization Bikers for Trump, a massive organization with actual influence in the Trump administration. We asked Gatt about her Facebook promotion of the lockdown protests via Facebook messenger, and she responded with a voice recording asking us тАЬWho are you really?тАЭ As part of her work on the Detmer campaign, and also in several instances that predate it, Gatt has frequently appeared at media spectacles that included Cortis and his Trump Unity Bridge. In 2017, for example, Gatt organized a Bikers for Trump event, which Cortis attended, that was meant to provide a тАЬbarrier wallтАЭ of protection between Kid Rock and a group of anti-Trump protesters at one of his shows.  Our database of boosters included other Cortis collaborators as well. In an event held a week after Operation Gridlock, Cortis and the Trump Unity Bridge were the featured attraction at a second lockdown-related protest outside of Gov. WhitmerтАЩs house. This event, which protesters dubbed тАЬOperation Queens Castle,тАЭ made national news despite its meager turnout. The event was pushed to several Facebook groups at the same time by Brandon Hall, who was also listed as the eventтАЩs host on Facebook. Hall is a self-described тАЬlifelong political nerd,тАЭ a former Michigan Trump Campaign volunteer, and a felon somewhat infamously convicted of election fraud in 2014. тАЬGretchen Whitmer is tyranny, this is like a third world country. ItтАЩs like V for Vendetta and Idiocracy hooked up and they produced this baby that is 2020,тАЭ Hall told local news outlet Up North Live from outside WhitmerтАЩs home.  Hall pushed the QueenтАЩs Castle event to many of the same groups used by Cortis and Holland, including Auto Workers for Trump 2020. Brian Pannebecker, who was described in a September 2017 report as тАЬa go-to source for reporters seeking comment from Trump backers in Michigan,тАЭ runs the Auto Workers Facebook group. Indeed, Pannebecker has been quoted as the voice of Michigan Trump supporters on a host of issues in a wide range of venues, including CNN and the Wall Street Journal, and has himself penned several opinion pieces lauding Trump published by his local newspaper. He has also attended multiple events with both Cortis and Hall.  Some combination of these above individuals, all of whom were involved in the promotion of the lockdown protests on Facebook, are disproportionately represented in past media accounts regarding pro-Trump demonstrations in Michigan. In September 2019, for example, Pannepacker, Cortis, and Gatt were each quoted or discussed in the Macomb DailyтАЩs coverage of a тАЬflash mobтАЭ meant to тАЬcounteract illegitimate attacks on the president.тАЭ Explaining her reason for attending this flash mob, participant Darlene Doetzel asserted to that newspaper that тАЬfake news is out there every day, seven days a week telling lies.тАЭ Doetzel, it bears mentioning, is also one of the boosters identified in our database. She did not respond to requests for comment we sent by Facebook messenger and email. These observations do not demonstrate some elaborate and centralized pro-Trump conspiracy. Instead, they are notable because they suggest that the major impetus, when it comes to the people who promoted the lockdown events on Facebook and had their voices amplified in national or international media reports, was not so much the specific public-health measures meant to counter COVID-19. Rather, it was support of Trump in general. Their dedication to the anti-lockdown cause specifically is somewhat undermined by their history of supporting several attention-grabbing, pro-Trump causes dating back to 2016. In other words, they would likely still be holding protests and demonstrations in a non-pandemic reality. Furthermore, these observations make clear that a supposedly massive grassroots movement was тАФ at least at its conception тАФ principally the result of a much smaller number of activists who know how to create a media spectacle. тАЬIf Betsy DeVos is reading this,тАЭ Hall wrote to us on Facebook messenger when we asked about financial support for his activism, тАЬGirl, I have NOT gotten the check the Twitter people and other radical liberals are saying I received.тАЭ Every protest organizer or promoter we contacted similarly denied receiving funds from anyone for their activism, and in most cases this is consistent with the evidence available to us via public records and campaign disclosures. Attempting to tie the DeVoses to these protesters or the movement they represent through the Michigan Freedom FundтАЩs $250 Facebook ad buy misses the substantial role played by the political action machine the DeVoses birthed in the early 2010s, which turned Michigan into a right-to-work state. The passage of right-to-work legislation in Michigan, an anti-union cause banning mandatory union dues as a condition of employment, was a major political coup. It almost certainly wouldnтАЩt have occurred, according to many of the politicians involved, without the significant financial and political pressure applied by the DeVoses and the political action network they created to promote it. Following a 2009 victory that defeated a pro-union bill in the Michigan legislature, Dick DeVos, Jr. (husband of Betsy DeVos) and Ron Weiser, a former Michigan GOP chair, U.S. ambassador and тАЬpolitical guru,тАЭ began to strategize a path toward passing full right-to-work legislation. This path included recruiting from and fostering the grassroots activism of the Tea Party movement, financing candidates in local elections while promising support to candidates who faced tough reelection battles for their support of right-to-work, research on messaging, and lots of ad buys. The Michigan Freedom Fund тАФ the same one that bought $250 worth of ads for Operation Gridlock тАФ was explicitly founded to fund one of those ad buys.  Many of the activists we connected to the Facebook promotion of the early Michigan lockdown protests were also activists associated with the DeVos-Weiser push to get right-to-work legislation passed in Michigan. Pannebecker, of the group Autoworkers for Trump 2020, for example, has repeatedly referred to himself in media reports as a тАЬspokesperson for Michigan Freedom to Work.тАЭ He has attended at least one Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference тАФ an event historically financed in large part by organizations connected to or funded by the DeVoses тАФ where he was photographed with DeVos associate Weiser. We asked Pannebecker on Facebook messenger if any connection existed between the freedom-to-work movement and his auto workers Facebook group and its use in promoting anti-lockdown measures, or if he has been paid by or supported by outside money. He simply replied тАЬno.тАЭ While many of the people we identified as pushing these protests to multiple Facebook groups used PannebeckerтАЩs Auto Workers for Trump 2020 group, several boosters тАФ Cortis, Doetzel, and Hall тАФ all used the Facebook group Lakes Area TEA Party for that purpose as well. While the Lakes Area TEA Party as an organization was founded by current Michigan Conservative Coalition leaders, the Facebook group was created in 2013 by Tim Bos, who rose to prominence as a former union worker who became тАЬa vocal proponentтАЭ of the right-to-work movement. His Facebook profile states that he attended the Leadership Institute, described by the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets as тАЬa decades-old nonprofit that provides training for conservative activists.тАЭ It receives significant funding from the conservative dark-money group DonorsTrust, which itself receives significant funding from the DeVos family. Bos did not respond to our request for comment. Former Michigan State Sen. Colbeck, whose campaign for governor paid funds to Trump Unity Bridge owner Cortis, is intimately linked to the DeVos political machine via right-to-work legislation. According to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, his rise as a Tea Party politician was heavily funded by DeVos money, and when he held elected office he advocated fiercely for their policies. As senator, he was one of the co-sponsors of the successfully passed Michigan right-to-work legislation. Colbeck, often as part of the Mike Detmer for Congress campaign, is a frequent speaker at pro-Trump events. He and Detmer were also all in attendance at Operation Gridlock and the later protest, the American Patriot Rally, that received widespread coverage due to the armed militias in the Michigan Capitol. Finally, as previously mentioned, DetmerтАЩs campaign for Congress is currently run by Facebook booster Holland. Holland, who has appeared at several events with both Colbeck and Cortis and has worked closely alongside protest booster Gatt, is on the board of the Michigan Conservative Union. This organization appears to share a phone number, email address, and contact person with the group Michigan Freedom to Work тАФ the same organization that Pannebecker has stated in past media reports to have been a spokesperson for. Again, this does not suggest a massive, centralized conspiracy orchestrated by the DeVos family to activate a past network of right-to-work activists to oppose restrictions on COVID-19 public health measures. What these connections instead show is that a small group of zealous activists identified by our database do not credibly represent the voice of grassroots citizens untouched by political influence. These individuals (as evidenced by their past activism) and the infrastructure they control (as evidenced by its creation for another political purpose) mobilized not for their objection to lockdowns specifically. Instead, the primary effect of their efforts by design seems to be energizing TrumpтАЩs base in an election year.   On June 11, 2019, a local Republican organization, the Michigan 10th Congressional District GOP, hosted its annual Ronald Reagan Dinner тАФ a fundraiser headlined that year by National GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale. None of the attendees could have possibly known that a pandemic would be declared nine months later, necessitating a global wave of stay-at-home orders that would grind the global economy to a halt and fundamentally transform daily life in America and across the world. Yet virtually everyone identified in our dataset as boosting the anti-lockdown protests on Facebook, or associated with the Michigan Conservative Coalition, was in attendance at that dinner. Present were flash-mob attendee and protest booster Doetzel, Detmer campaign director protest booster Holland, Operation QueenтАЩs Castle organizer and protest booster Hall, Trump Unity Bridge driver and protest booster Cortis, and Autoworkers for TrumpтАЩs Pannebecker. The Michigan Conservative CoalitionтАЩs Maddock, Sheridan, and Ponkowski were all there as well. So was Matt Seely, the current president of the Michigan Conservative Coalition. In his keynote address, Parscale accused Democrats of a litany of offenses related to immigration, healthcare, and environmental policy, telling the roused audience that, тАЬItтАЩs patriots like you who are going to stop them.тАЭ At the Michigan lockdown protest dubbed the тАЬAmerican Patriot RallyтАЭ less than a year later тАФ attended by many who were in the audience of the Ronald Reagan Dinner тАФ an armed militia entered the Michigan Capitol Building demanding the revocation of laws that health officials and epidemiologists say remain necessary to prevent further catastrophe. Another group organized an event that day alongside the Michigan Conservative CoalitionтАЩs efforts, and this second group may have been the one responsible for the armed protesters. But for many of the activists тАФ armed or not тАФ among the crowds gathered at the Patriot Rally, Operation QueenтАЩs Castle or Operation Gridlock, these demonstrations were evidently a single battle in a years-long war whose previous fronts have included flash mobs, billboard-painting parties, anti-impeachment rallies, and Kid Rock concerts. To be sure, hundreds of people attended both Operation Gridlock and the American Patriot Rally. Many likely had no connection to previous activism and were motivated to attend out of a genuine frustration at the stay-at-home measures and a fear of economic uncertainty. Anti-lockdown sentiment has been тАЬgenerated by people who are really angry and scared [and who] really see their governors and mayors as the problem behind this,тАЭ Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and co-author of the book тАЬThe Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,тАЭ told us in a phone interview. On the other hand, as we have demonstrated in this investigation, the spark that ignited the movement owes itself in no small part to a small coterie of activists whose messaging appears to have been honed тАФ at least in in some cases тАФ in conservative activist training programs, and whose use of a political action machine exists thanks to millions of dollars of funding from a handful of billionaires. This тАЬmixture of grassroots and top-down organizingтАЭ is what made the Tea Party movement of the early 2010s such a success, Williamson told us. тАЬI am worried about that,тАЭ she added, тАЬespecially for the upcoming election, because if this movement basically generates more enthusiasm, they could become a force politically well beyond this one particular issue.тАЭ Whether the anti-lockdown movement will become a force to be reckoned with is unclear. Polls suggest a majority of Americans support the lockdown measures and oppose the lockdown protests, even when only people who have lost their jobs and are suffering economic hardship are polled. What is clear, though, is that the movement has already expanded well beyond one particular issue, and those issues are becoming dangerously divorced from reality. The Michigan Conservative CoalitionтАЩs website, at the time of this reporting, showcases the objectively false anti-vaccine conspiracy video тАЬPlandemic.тАЭ The Facebook groups dedicated to the anti-lockdown cause are a fever swamp of conspiracy theories ranging from Bill GatesтАЩ desire to track the global population through microchips in COVID-19 vaccines to the notion that a cohort of patriots under the leadership of someone referred to as тАЬQтАЭ will overthrow the тАЬdeep state.тАЭ A $250 Facebook ad buy from the DeVos-linked Michigan Freedom Fund did not create this coalition, nor did it single-handedly launch the anti-lockdown movement. The well-connected political action machine that originally created the Michigan Freedom Fund, however, has been objectively successful in presenting the fringe views of that movement as having widespread grassroots support in national media coverage. This increasingly radicalized base, and the tactics that gave rise to Operation Gridlock, will no doubt become a potent messaging tool as the 2020 general election approaches. Reporters seeking the views of Midwest conservatives will need to be aware, among many other things, that Trump supporters other than Pannebecker and Cortis exist in Michigan.

3925,Downtown SLC protest against police brutality escalates,"Menu  SALT LAKE CITY тАФ A protest against police brutality in downtown Salt Lake City Saturday has escalated, leading to response from SWAT teams and the National Guard. The demonstration was one of multiple protests planned in response to the death of George Floyd, who died Monday in police custody after video showed a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe and went unconscious. Organizers also say they are demonstrating for 22-year-old Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City Police one week ago. The department is expected to release body camera footage within 10 days of the incident. The protest was intended by organizers to be peaceful, but it gradually escalated as the Salt Lake City Police Department headquarters building was vandalized with spray-painted messages, and an unoccupied SLCPD vehicle has been overturned, smashed and set on fire at 200 East and 400 South. A Utah Transit Authority TRAX station was also damaged. Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement on the incident: тАЬWe are in close contact with our department of public safety and receiving regular updates. Our hearts break for the family of George Floyd. We are grateful for the swift actions taken by the state of Minnesota to hold those responsible for his death accountable. We can not, however, condone violence, defacement of public buildings, and destruction of property. We call upon the good people of Utah to engage civilly and to act peaceably as they seek to exercise their first amendment rights.тАЭ He later announced he will be calling in the National Guard.Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, news media, people traveling directly to and from work, traveling directly to and from the Airport, seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or those experiencing homelessness. Police have asked the public to avoid the Salt Lake metro area if possible. Many of the demonstrators have marched to the State Capitol, where Utah Highway Patrol are keeping anyone from going up the stairs leading to the building. SLCPD SWAT teams have now responded downtown along with agencies from surrounding areas. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has announced a curfew at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday morning for the entire city. Mendenhall and SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said no one is allowed to be in public during that time even for traveling, but provided the following exceptions: Mendenhall and Brown held a press conference at 9 p.m. with an update on the curfew, asking the public to stay home and for protesters to go home. Brown also stated that six people had been arrested at the time. One officer was hit over the head with a baseball bat and is recovering in the hospital. Brown said if he had not been wearing a helmet, he would have likely been seriously injured or killed. About Us",1,3,0,0

Mr. Trump has stepped up to the fight and announced that the U.S. is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization over its handling of ChinaтАЩs role in the coronavirus crisis. He also imposed fresh sanctions on Beijing and Hong Kong officials for their security crackdown on the financial hub. The president disclosed over the weekend that he is working to add India, South Korea, Russia and Australia to the Group of Seven nationsтАЩ annual summit. Aides said the move is partly aimed at confronting ChinaтАЩs rising influence. TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure billMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestream тАЬFor the first time, we have a president of the United States who is prepared to push back against [ChinaтАЩs threats] and protect the American people,тАЭ Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on Fox BusinessтАЩ тАЬSunday Morning Futures.тАЭ The Global Times, a newspaper known as a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, suggested in a column that Beijing would be justified if it openly backed the protests and riots in the U.S. that have prompted eight governors to call out the National Guard.

The newspaper also took aim at Mr. Pompeo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. It mocked a statement Mrs. Pelosi made nearly a year ago that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were тАЬa beautiful sight to beholdтАЭ at the time. тАЬNow, the тАШbeautiful sightтАЩ is extending from Hong Kong to over a dozen U.S. states,тАЭ the paper said. тАЬU.S. politicians now can enjoy this sight from their own windows.тАЭ The demonstrations and, in many cases violent rioting, began last week in Minneapolis, where George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer handcuffed him and knelt directly on his neck for nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. тАЬA quick question for Pelosi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: Should the Chinese government and National PeopleтАЩs Congress issue a statement to support the protests by African-Americans and the grassroots of U.S. society?тАЭ Mr. Hu wrote. тАЬIt seems to be what Beijing should do according to the logic of Washington cheering for the rioters in Hong Kong.тАЭ Mr. Pompeo implicitly criticized the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping. тАЬItтАЩs a different Chinese Communist Party today than it was 10 years ago,тАЭ he said. тАЬThis is a Chinese Communist Party that has come to view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideals, Western democracies, Western values, and puts Americans at risk,тАЭ he said. тАЬThe list is long, whether itтАЩs stealing American intellectual property, destroying hundreds and millions of jobs here in the United States, further efforts to put at risk sea lanes in the South China Sea, denying commercial traffic.тАЭ White House National Security Adviser Robert OтАЩBrien said the presidentтАЩs decision to pull the U.S. out of WHO was designed to force the international organization to end its тАЬreliance on China.тАЭ тАЬWeтАЩre going to beat this COVID disease that was unleashed on us and came from China,тАЭ Mr. OтАЩBrien said on CNNтАЩs тАЬState of the Union.тАЭ тАЬBut in the meantime, weтАЩre going to take that $440 million that the U.S. spends, compared to the $40 million that the Chinese spend on the WHO, and weтАЩre going to make sure it gets to front-line health care workers.тАЭ Mr. Trump announced Friday that the U.S. was terminating its relationship with WHO over its handling of the coronarvirus crisis and took actions to punish China for misleading the world on the virus and for its security crackdown on Hong Kong. The president also announced he was ending U.S. preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong. He said Hong Kong is no longer a separate territory because Beijing moved to curb its autonomy. тАЬChinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world,тАЭ Mr. Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden. тАЬThe Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside.тАЭ Deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 rose to nearly 104,000 on Sunday. Business shutdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus have thrown roughly 40 million Americans out of work in less than three months. The president said the sudden hardship wrought by the virus was one reason he insisted on attending the first manned space launch in the U.S. in nine years on Saturday in Florida. тАЬItтАЩs such a great inspiration for our country,тАЭ Mr. Trump said of the Space X launch. тАЬWe think next year is going to be one of the best years weтАЩve ever had, economically. We suffered something that was terrible. It should have never happened. It should have never come out of China, but it did. They didnтАЩt stop it. They were unable, probably, to stop it.тАЭ The president is imposing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials who are involved in restricting freedoms in Hong Kong. He also is moving to end Hong KongтАЩs preferential trading status with the U.S. тАЬHeтАЩs asked us to review every preferential treatment that Hong Kong had and work to eliminate it. It no longer make sense,тАЭ Mr. Pompeo said. The administration also is suspending the entry of тАЬcertain foreign nationals from ChinaтАЭ as potential security risks. The presidentтАЩs move will affect a small percentage of the approximately 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S., including graduate students and researchers with ties to the Chinese military. The president said BeijingтАЩs crackdown on Hong Kong тАЬis a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China and, indeed, the people of the world.тАЭ тАЬChina claims it is protecting national security, but the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society,тАЭ Mr. Trump said. тАЬBeijingтАЩs decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of ChinaтАЩs invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty. China has replaced its promise formula of тАШone country, two systemsтАЩ with тАШone country, one system.тАЩтАЭ Rep. Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican and a leading congressional critic of ChinaтАЩs human rights record, said past administrations answered China with тАЬcheap rhetoricтАЭ that emboldened its communist rulers. тАЬPresident Trump, however, is beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do,тАЭ Mr. Smith said. тАЬFor the sake of oppressed people, the United States тАФ even if we have to go it alone тАФ must impose sanctions.тАЭ The State Department outraged Chinese leaders last week by declaring that U.S. leaders officially assess that Hong Kong no longer has the legal and economic freedom that the Chinese government promised under its treaty with Britain that gave the former colony back to Beijing in 1997. Chinese media accused Mr. Trump of hypocrisy with his sanctions over Hong KongтАЩs protests. тАЬTrump really had the nerve to make the announcement when a group of furious Washington citizens were storming toward the White House,тАЭ the Global Times column said Saturday. тАЬWashington must have failed to anticipate that retribution could come that fast. It should be thinking about it though.тАЭ In classic pro-China propagandist fashion, the Global Times column characterized the U.S. demonstrations as equivalent to protests against Chinese communist authoritarianism that have been rocking Hong Kong in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets in the territory to push back against the Chinese communist governmentтАЩs gradual moves to strip the global financial hub of freedoms and governmental autonomy. Citing the clashes in American cities, the Global Times claimed that it is тАЬas if the radical rioters in Hong Kong somehow snuck into the U.S. and created a mess.тАЭ The column suggested that the U.S. protests were a kind of punishment for Mr. Trump over his policy on Hong Kong and said the U.S. political system is тАЬdecliningтАЭ at an тАЬacceleratingтАЭ rate. It sought to cast the authoritarian communist government in Beijing as superior. тАЬThe odds of outbreaks of riots in the U.S. are much higher than they are in China,тАЭ it claimed. тАЬHow could politicians in Washington possibly define the disturbances in other countries as тАШbeautiful sightsтАЩ publicly? It is stupid to do so simply because they want to attack China. LetтАЩs wait and see which country will encounter more chaos.тАЭ тАв Tom Howell Jr. and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

3963,"Trump Salutes Protest Where ""Hang Fauci"" Sign Was Displayed","┬й First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Donald Trump praised protesters who harassed a journalist on Long Island this week at a rally where one man called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci. The president of the United States voiced his support on Saturday for a protest against New York stateтАЩs public health orders that was backed by an anti-government militia and anti-vaccine activists who called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nationтАЩs senior immunologist. The тАЬRe-Open NYтАЭ rally on Thursday in Commack, New York was organized by a group of Trump supporters who call themselves the Setauket Patriots, but also endorsed by anti-vaccination activists and the Long Island branch of the Oath Keepers, a national organization of current and former law enforcement officers and military veterans who think they are defending the nation from a range of imaginary threats posed by the federal government. Amid a sea of American flags and Trump banners, several of the signs waved by the protesters referenced conspiracy theories promoted by radical anti-vaccine activists that demonize Fauci and the philanthropist Bill Gates. A protester at a rally in Commack, New York on Thursday displayed a sign calling for the execution of the nationтАЩs leading immunologist and a billionaire philanthropist. Photo: News 12 Long Island In addition to placards calling for New York to open businesses, others displayed at the rally channeled conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists who believe that Bill Gates is somehow behind the crisis. тАЬJust Say NO to Bill Gates,тАЭ read one sign. Another, with idiosyncratic punctuation, read: тАЬMy SonтАЩs Are Not Lab Rats For Bill Gates Vaccine.тАЭ The protest outside a shuttered department store was attended by just a few hundred people, but it drew national attention after a local news reporter, Kevin Vesey, posted video of himself being harassed by demonstrators. The level of anger directed at the media from these protestors was alarming. As always, I will tell a fair and unbiased story today. pic.twitter.com/5jCR0YY9VH The protesters echoed the presidentтАЩs anti-media harangues by complaining to Vesey that his channel, News 12 Long Island, had тАЬstopped airing the Trump briefings,тАЭ and taunted him with the chant, тАЬFake news is not essential.тАЭ One woman told the reporter, тАЬYouтАЩre the virus.тАЭ Another accused him of тАЬdestroying Suffolk and Long IslandтАЭ through his reporting on the coronavirus crisis. Suffolk County, where the protest took place, has been among the worst hit in the United States, with 37,942 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,733 deaths as of Saturday. That means the suburban New York county of just under 1.5 million people has a mortality rate more than 4 times the national average. One of those cases was News 12тАЩs Vesey, who tested positive last month and recently recovered from a relatively mild case of the illness. During a longer Facebook Live report from the demonstration, Vesey was menaced at close range by a man in a Trump hat and shirt who was not wearing a mask but said that he did not need to keep his distance because, тАЬI got hydroxychloroquine; IтАЩll be fine, bro.тАЭ The man held a sign that called on one side for New YorkтАЩs Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, to be deposed, and on the other accused his brother, Chris Cuomo, of lying about his bout with Covid-19. Another protester held up a sign saying Fauci тАЬhas to goтАЭ and falsely asserted that he тАЬworks forтАЭ for the World Health Organization. The television report Vesey filed on Thursday evening included video of one of the demonstrators displaying a sign for the camera that read: тАЬHang Fauci, Hang Gates, Open Up All Our States.тАЭ I'll probably never forget what happened today.I was insulted. I was berated. I was practically chased by people who refused to wear masks in the middle of a pandemic.All the while, I was there to tell THEIR story. Here's the finished product. pic.twitter.com/HV2Hrcs7gi On Saturday morning, in a tweet that echoed his infamous praise for white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville in 2017, Trump described the protesters who had harassed the reporter as тАЬGreat people!тАЭ James Robitsek, a leader of the pro-Trump Setauket Patriots group that organized the protest, confirmed in a Facebook message on Saturday that his call for opponents of the lockdown to rally had been supported by the local chapter of the anti-government Oath Keepers militia. тАЬThey copied my post and made up their own for their group,тАЭ Robitsek said of the Oath Keepers. тАЬThey come to our events and vice versa. We all share events, our group is only 40-50 members.тАЭ ThursdayтАЩs gathering, he said, included тАЬmany people from other groups, or who just saw the post and wanted to come down.тАЭ The Oath KeepersтАЩs name is a reference to the belief of its members that they are bound by their pledge to тАЬdefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,тАЭ even if that means defying the government. As Justine Sharrock reported for Mother Jones in 2010, a year after the group was founded, some of the groupтАЩs first members were convinced then that it would not be long тАЬbefore President Obama finds some pretext тАФ a pandemic, a natural disaster, a terror attack тАФ to impose martial law, ban interstate travel, and begin detaining citizens en masse.тАЭ In an open letter posted online last month, the Long Island branch of the militia group echoed that belief, by declaring that the stateтАЩs orders to shut down businesses, churches and public gatherings were the acts of тАЬan overbearing government acting under the guise of benevolenceтАЭ and had created тАЬan untenable situationтАЭ that justified resistance. тАЬAny government, or governing representative which acts in such a manner, attempts to act outside of the Constitution, and must be put on notice as doing such,тАЭ the group wrote. The national groupтАЩs founder, Stewart Rhodes, a libertarian trial lawyer and former Ron Paul staffer, mocked Trump earlier this week for tweeting in support of protesters in Pennsylvania who want to re-open businesses. тАЬUh, they are using YOUR AdminтАЩs guidelines, including the Orwellian тАШessential/non-essentialтАЩ paradigm, which is like something out of the USSR,тАЭ Rhodes tweeted back at the president. On Twitter, Rhodes has also shared anti-vaccine conspiracy theories related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including one meme that described Gates as a тАЬvaccine pushing globalist eugenicistтАЭ and urged readers тАЬto REFUSE to take ANY vaccine he funds, тАШmandatoryтАЩ or not.тАЭ He also encouraged his followers to listen to a podcast in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attacked Gates and boosted a conspiracy theory about Fauci. The baseless smear on Fauci was first made by a discredited scientist who claims, without evidence, that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director buried her research about how vaccines can damage peopleтАЩs immune systems. Those false claims about Fauci and Gates have been spread widely by the pro-Trump conspiracy group QAnon and by prominent anti-vaccine activists who have taken a leading role in recent protests demanding an end to the emergency public health orders in California, Texas and New York. Robitsek, the Setauket PatriotsтАЩ leader, insisted that three of the people seen in VeseyтАЩs video harassing the reporter were тАЬnot associated with our groupтАЭ and suggested that at least one of them тАФ the man who had refused stay away from the reporter тАФ might have been тАЬa plant by left leaning groups in the area who were against our rally coming to Commack.тАЭ If so, the man has been under deep cover for some time, since a photograph on the Setauket Patriots Facebook page shows that he was also at a previous protest at the same spot two weeks ago. On that occasion, which was also covered by Vesey for News 12 Long Island, the man made no attempt to harass the reporter and did nothing to tarnish the reputation of the protesters. As for the woman who told Vesey he was the virus, Robitsek called her тАЬa wacko,тАЭ and noted that she travels to protests all across the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut provoking confrontations and filming them for her groupтАЩs Facebook page. Robitsek, who said that he has been unemployed for almost nine weeks and is yet to receive any payment from the state, cast the rally as a non-partisan attempt to push New York to let people earn a living. тАЬWe all need to work,тАЭ he said. тАЬGive me my unemployment, and IтАЩll stay home then but I need to pay my bills and eat. People are getting desperate.тАЭ Anxious to counter the negative publicity generated by VeseyтАЩs video, Robitsek also suggested that a тАЬlocal moms groupтАЭ that was opposed to the rally had been тАЬin cahoots with the media before it even started.тАЭ But the only evidence he could cite for that was a screenshot of a Facebook post from a member of the group Commack Parents Network, in which she had simply passed on an interview request from Vesey, saying that he would like one or more of them to explain why they were opposed to the re-opening protest taking place in their town. Robitsek also said that his group had agreed not to wave Trump flags, in a bid to be bipartisan, but many members of other groups who came to the rally did so. For his part, Robitsek wore what appeared to be one of TrumpтАЩs red caps, albeit a more understated one тАФ with тАЬUSAтАЭ stitched on the front and тАЬ45тАЭ on the side тАФ and a mask, while carrying an American flag. In addition to his group and the Oath Keepers, Robitsek said, members of the Conservative Society for Action also attended the rally, as did, тАЬa bunch of anti-vaccine people.тАЭ Updated: Monday, May 18 1:12 a.m. PDTThis article was updated with a new headline. Robert Mackey[email protected]тАЛtheintercept.com@RobertMackey The findings sparked a media sensation and led to a change in federal law. The insurance giantтАЩs role was surprisingly common.

4425,30 Scenes From George Floyd Protests Across The World,"May 31, 2020, 6:31 am* For the past several days and nights, protests have sprung up in numerous cities against police brutality and state violence against black men and women. They began in Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd was killed by Officer Derek Chauvin, who leaned on FloydтАЩs throat for eight minutes as he begged to be released, saying he could not breathe. The horrific scene was caught on tape and widely shared. As peaceful protesters were met with even more violence, including tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, tensions exploded. A police precinct was taken over and set on fire. Riots and looting took over many areas. Soon the city was put under a curfew, but it was too late to quell the rebellion. People all across the U.S. are fed up with the violence perpetrated by cops, especially racially motivated attacks against black citizens. Protests have sprung up in almost every state, in numerous cities. While most of these protests have started out as peaceful marches and gatherings, many have escalated as militarized police forces turn their weapons on the people, seemingly with impunity. Journalists have been arrested and targeted, even while cameras are running. There is a stark contrast of enforcement responses to anti-lockdown #protests where armed white civilians stormed govтАЩt buildings & others are on camera shoving police vs. nationwide #protests against police violence, where targeted arrests & use of force are deployed by police. https://t.co/rCcqBR9O7C тАФ Dreisen Heath (@dreisenheath) May 30, 2020  ItтАЩs unclear how things will end, but after months of lockdown and over 100,000 people dead of a virus the government has failed to contain, plus a looming depression, people are not going to be placated by platitudes anymore.

4510,Former President Barack Obama puts out guidelines to 'get to work' amid George Floyd protests,"The former president wrote about how to use this moment to make """"real change."""" Communities come together in wake of George FloydтАЩs death Former President Barack Obama published a piece on Medium on Monday addressing the protests nationwide following the death of George Floyd -- and, specifically, how he thinks people can move forward to """"sustain momentum to bring about real change."""" """"Ultimately, itтАЩs going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times,"""" he wrote. """"But I believe there are some basic lessons to draw from past efforts that are worth remembering."""" His message overall stressed the importance of voting and participating in politics, particularly at the local level, where decisions on ground-level criminal justice and police practices are formed. The """"bottom line,"""" he wrote, is that """"if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isnтАЩt between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."""" The nation's first and only African American president began by acknowledging that """"the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States,"""" noting that most people demonstrating have been """"peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring."""" He also noted that """"police in cities like Camden and Flint have commendably understood"""" that the protesters """"deserve our respect and support."""" He also addressed the violence that has broken out at protests in several cities, although the exact root of that violence has been disputed, especially as it differs between locations. In his post, Obama requested people """"not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."""" From there, Obama addressed the importance of participating in politics and voting in every election, saying that """"the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels."""" He said reform agendas will vary from place to place but should be tailored to each community and that it's up to organizers to educate themselves of what strategies work best. """"The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away,"""" he wrote. Obama concluded his letter by acknowledging the pain in America, amid protests and a pandemic. """"I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting -- that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,"""" he wrote. """"But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful."""" He said the next moment in American history can be """"a real turning point"""" if """"we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action."""" The post also linked up to a toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, based on a task force on policing Obama formed while at White House, and also to resources at the Obama Foundation, he said, """"to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action."""" Later Monday, Obama summarized the essay in a series of tweets, saying in part: """"Ultimately, itтАЩs going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times."""" This is the second time the former president has written something on the nation's unrest in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. """"This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America,"""" Obama wrote in a statement posted to Twitter Friday. """"It can't be 'normal.' If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."""" President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has taken a different approach, facing some criticism for failing to address and unify the nation as protests grew over the weekend. Hours before Obama issued a statement Friday, Trump tweeted about the protests in Minneapolis, saying that """"thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd"""" and, referencing the military, that """"when the looting starts, the shooting starts."""" The tweet was flagged by Twitter as """"glorifying violence."""" Trump on Sunday blamed """"ANTIFA"""" for the protests turning violent and said he would label it as a terrorist organization, although his authority to deem a domestic group a terror organization remains unclear. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",1,3,0,0
4591,"Dallas man loses eye to ""non-lethal"" police round during George Floyd protest, attorneys say","Watch CBSN Live  Updated on: June 4, 2020 / 3:40 PM / CBS News Dallas тАФ Brandon Saenz was in a crowd protesting police brutality Saturday when he says he became a victim of it. """"All I heard was a boom. I got hit,"""" Saenz said. """"I put my hands up, and I put my hand on my eye, and then I took off running,"""" he said. The 26-year-old said he did nothing to provoke being shot with a non-lethal sponge round, but as a result, attorneys say, he lost his left eye, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. """"It is ironic that a protest about excessive use of force and police brutality ends with excessive use of force and police brutality,"""" said Jesuorobo Enobakhare, who chairs the Dallas Police Oversight Board. Protesters have called for the Police Oversight Board to resume regular meetings that stopped during the coronavirus shutdowns. Next week it will. On its agenda will be votes on whether to investigate how the Dallas Police Department handles protests, as well as an incident that happened Monday night when hundreds of protesters walked onto the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. CBS DFW said it heard bangs and saw smoke, and saw a protester being carried away. """"She was flash-banged by police officers for walking peacefully,"""" said the person helping her from the scene. Dallas Police Oversight monitor Tonya McClary, who reports to the board, said her office has seen a surge in complaints in the last two days. """"Our voicemail is almost full. We're still going through emails. What we've been able to get through right now is about 100,"""" she said. Some cases, like Saenz's, have been fast-tracked and are already under investigation. McClary said some complaints against officers may be tossed out. Others could lead to discipline. The most serious cases could result in criminal investigations of officers involved. She said her office will independently review the department's decisions and, if it disagrees with any, can launch its own investigation. She and the board will also be able to look at the bigger picture and recommend any policy changes for the Dallas Police Department as a whole. The board is asking for photos, videos and first-hand accounts from the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge protest. First published on June 4, 2020 / 1:07 PM ┬й 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

4621,"Even In Coronavirus Crisis, WHO Believes That Public Protests Are Important : Goats and Soda : NPR","Pien Huang Allison Aubrey In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization took time at its daily press conference to address another pressing issue: the wave of protests against police violence and racial injustice. The demonstrations began in the U.S. when George Floyd died on May 25 after a police officer had pressed a knee into his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds while detaining him in Minneapolis. The protests are now spreading around the world to Europe, Africa and other regions. """"WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"""" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on June 8. The demonstrations have prompted fear that the close contact of thousands of marchers could lead to a spike in case counts тАФ which hit a new high on Sunday, with 136,000 cases reported that day. Modelers say it's difficult to assess how the protests will influence COVID-19 infections. Because COVID-19 generally has an incubation time of up to two weeks, public health officials think it will take a couple of weeks before they see the impact. But it's clear that a key ingredient for transmission is present at many of these rallies: close contact. The images of protesters standing shoulder to shoulder тАФ some wearing face masks, others not тАФ raise concerns, especially in cities with higher rates of infection. To that end, Tedros recommends that protesters follow the guidance of local health officials and take precautions to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. """"We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely,"""" he said, """"Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."""" He also advised people to maintain a safe distance from others тАФ and to stay home if they are sick. """"The riskiest situation to be in is to be in close proximity to a case, particularly a symptomatic case, of COVID-19,"""" said Michael Ryan, director of WHO's health emergencies program at the Monday press conference, so healthy people protesting next to one another may not meet the definition of coming in contact with the disease. However, it's become clear to researchers that the new coronavirus can be spread by people who aren't showing symptoms of it. """"Local public health official[s], on the basis of abundance of caution, could advise people either to quarantine or to get tested [after attending a mass gathering],"""" Ryan said. Local officials have expressed similar worries about the interplay of the protests and the pandemic. Last week Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was concerned about what mass gatherings in the streets """"could mean for spikes in our coronavirus cases later."""" She urged protesters to consider their exposure and consider being tested. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced free tests for demonstrators. Officials in Atlanta and New York have suggested testing as well. """"Testing everyone that participated in demonstrations would be useful in communities where many new cases are being reported every day. These new cases indicate that transmission is occurring at a high rate in the communities,"""" said Bill Miller, an epidemiologist and physician at Ohio State University. He said an alternative to testing everyone would be active contact tracing. """"With new cases, the tracers could ask about demonstration participation, including days and times,"""" Miller said. Then, if cases are linked to a demonstration, a call could go out to get everyone who participated in that event to be tested. Being outdoors seems to reduce the risk of exposure because the virus can't survive long in sunlight and there's better air circulation, but it's no guarantee against infection. Health experts warn that some activities linked with the protests тАФ such as riding public transportation to attend rallies or getting arrested and jailed indoors with others тАФ could increase a person's risk of getting exposed to the virus. Meanwhile, protests are expected to continue in the days ahead. George Floyd's burial service will take place on Tuesday at a private service in Houston.

4703,Undercover Investigation - Minneapolis Riot Was Preplanned,"HOME ACCESS GALLERY NEWS SHOP CONTACT More We have sources imbedded within these groups to get to the bottom of where all this leftist radicalization is coming from. We got their plans, manuals, intercepted internal communications, and have recordings of their zoom chats. What you are about to see is part of a two year undercover investigation into the leftist radicalization imbedded within the climate justice movement that contributed to the riots in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this first video, we are going to show how the Sunrise Movement played a preemptive role in carrying out the mayhem, taking advantage of George Floyd's death and using it as a trigger point, to further push their Green New Deal agenda and promoting the abolition of the police. We didnтАЩt expect to find organizers radicalizing middle school and high school children teaching them military tactics and preparation for high risk actions. Some of these tactics include escalation provocation techniques, blocking freeway traffic, and how to get arrested bogging-down law enforcement in the name of destroying capitalism to make way for the Green New Deal. What some parents may have though were innocent youth organizations genuinely fostered and ran by children are actually top-down monolithic structures with private intelligence, military contractors, and foreign interests influencing children to carry out their subversive objectives. The events that erupted in Minneapolis, Minnesota were not a spontaneous reaction to the murder of George Floyd. These were well planned events anticipating some perfect trigger point to bring about the тАЬnew normalтАЭ - a world without police, without borders, without industry, without wealth, without private property, without an economy - a world based on communist ideals imbedded within the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is not about climate change, it is about climate justice - a radical new ideology hellbent on destroying western civilization under the false pretense that white supremacy is the leading cause of climate change, social injustice and all problems globally. The organizers of these Youth Non-government Organizations, or Youngos, embellish white supremacy as a systemic problem, hyper-focusing on statistically rare instances of racial inequality and injustice, while ignoring great strides of progress the United States has made over the past century towards equal opportunity and criminal justice reform. However, in order to normalize radical policies put forth by the Green New Deal, crises have to be capitalized on to further their agenda while destroying the great accomplishments of civil rights movements of the past.

4736,Buffalo police riot squad quit to back officers who shoved man,"An entire tactical unit of a US police department has quit after two officers accused of brutality were placed on unpaid leave, reports local media. In a video that went viral on Thursday, officers in the city of Buffalo, New York, were seen shoving an elderly man to the ground. The 75-year-old was seriously injured, and taken to hospital. All 57 officers in the riot squad have now reportedly resigned in protest at their two colleagues' suspension. According to the Buffalo News, the members have stepped down from the Emergency Response Team, but not the police department itself. John Evans, president of the local police union, told the newspaper: """"Our position is these officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square. """"It doesn't specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40. They were simply doing their job. I don't know how much contact was made. He did slip in my estimation. He fell backwards."""" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday the two officers should be fired, and called for the incident to be investigated for """"possible criminal charges"""". In a statement, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said: """"We can confirm that contingency plans are in place to maintain police services and ensure public safety within our community."""" He added that Buffalo police are continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies. The officers were enforcing a curfew as a result of protests that have spread nationwide since the death in Minneapolis last month of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The man is seen approaching a group of riot police as they advance. Two of the officers appear to push the 75-year-old, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had """"tripped"""" and fallen during a """"skirmish involving protesters"""". Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident. His name is Martin Gugino, and authorities said he was taken to hospital, where he was in a stable but serious condition on Friday. Mr Gugino is a longtime social justice activist in Buffalo, according to advocacy group Push (People United for Sustainable Housing). He """"has been a tireless fighter against injustice of all types for many years in our city both with Push and other grassroots organisations,"""" they said in a statement, condemning police for his treatment.

4757,"Democrats Block Republican Police Reform Bill, Kill Hope Of Passing Legislation Amid Protests","Democratic Senators have blocked a Republican police reform bill, leaving the legislation dead on the floor of Congress and likely defeating any Federal attempt to address police reform as a whole. The bill failed before its text ever made it to the floor. Democrats were able to marshal their caucus to defeat a vote designed to bring the issue to the floor for debate and killed the bill 55-45. A total of 60 votes would have been necessary to move the bill forward. тАЬRepublicans had 53 votes, but not enough Democrats joined them,тАЭ Fox News reports. Only Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) crossed partisan lines. Democrats fought the Republican bill, led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which they said did not go far enough in addressing critical issues at the crux of police reform. The bill did not ban the use of chokeholds outright, preferring instead to warn departments to craft their own policies against the practice or risk losing federal funds. The bill also shied away from outlawing so-called тАЬno-knockтАЭ warrants, preferring instead to establish a national database to track those warrantsтАЩ use and abuse. The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has its own bill which the Democratic caucus plans to bring to the floor there on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was apoplectic about the situation in an interview that took place just after the procedural vote failed. тАЬThe Senate was supposed to officially take up police reform on the floor today. Instead, our Democratic colleagues are poised to turn this routine step into a partisan impasse,тАЭ he told reporters, adding that the bill could have been the subject of debate and compromise, but Democrats refused to come to the bargaining table. McConnell called DemocratsтАЩ strategy in proposing the bill тАЬbizarre,тАЭ particularly given that they refused to even agree to debate the measure. тАЬThey donтАЩt want a debate, they donтАЩt want amendments, theyтАЩll filibuster police reform from even reaching the floor of the Senate unless the majority lets the minority rewrite the bill behind closed doors in advance,тАЭ McConnell said. The lead up to WednesdayтАЩs vote has been acrimonious, sometimes to a shocking degree. Speaking late Tuesday, Pelosi accused Republicans, including Scott тАФ the first black man to serve in both the House and Senate тАФ of тАЬtrying to get away with murder, actually тАУ the murder of George Floyd.тАЭ When pressed on the fact that her statement could be considered racially charged, Pelosi refused to apologize. On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked McConnell directly, warning the ranking Republican that he did not have тАЬCivil Rights leadersтАЭ on his side. Since it is unlikely that the Senate will take up any House bill on the issue of police reform, itтАЩs likely that efforts have ended to pass federal legislation on the matter, despite a nationwide movement.

Instead, he said he would mobilize тАЬall available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights.тАЭ He specifically called on governors across the country to deploy the National Guard and vowed to deploy the U.S. military if states refused to comply. тАЬMayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,тАЭ Trump said. Activating the military would require Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy active-duty military on U.S. soil. The statute was last used during the 1992 uprising in Los Angeles over the acquittals of police officers involved in the brutal beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist. Protesters were peacefully gathered outside the White House even as Trump began speaking. Authorities, however, fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades in an attempt to move them away from the area before the presidentтАЩs address began. We can hear the explosions from the streets as Trump is speaking in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/yRporcjN0T Here's the moment where police fired teargas into a crowd of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park, just minutes before Trump's address in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/KPjxMKdDyx The public areas around the White House, particularly Lafayette Square, have been host to demonstrations for four days. On Sunday night, peaceful gatherings turned violent as police clashed with some protesters and several nearby buildings were vandalized or burned. Calling himself тАЬyour law-and-order president,тАЭ Trump pledged to escalate efforts to clamp down on the protests in Washington. тАЬAs we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,тАЭ Trump said. As his remarks ended, Trump said he was leaving to go pay his respects тАЬto a very, very special place.тАЭ He later walked through Lafayette Park, which had minutes earlier been filled with demonstrators, on his way to St. JohnтАЩs Church, where he posed for a photo while holding up a Bible and then left. Trump holds up a bible, literally shushes reporters trying to ask him about his threat to use the military against citizens, poses for a photo, and leaves. pic.twitter.com/w2lPWWjMKu The presidentтАЩs remarks came amid nationwide protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of American cities demanding justice for Floyd and other Black victims of police brutality. In many of those cities, police have deployed violent tactics to attempt to quell demonstrations, including firing rubber bullets and tear gas, pepper-spraying crowds and hitting people with batons. Trump has been at odds with several governors as protests over FloydтАЩs death have spread across the nation. In a call on Monday, he said state leaders were тАЬweak,тАЭ urging them to arrest demonstrators and тАЬput them in jail for 10 years.тАЭ тАЬYou have to dominate. If you donтАЩt dominate, youтАЩre wasting your time,тАЭ the president said during the call. тАЬTheyтАЩre going to run over you. YouтАЩre going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.тАЭ The language built on TrumpтАЩs vocal denouncements of demonstrators as тАЬthugs.тАЭ In a widely criticized missive on Twitter, the president threatened violent intervention and said he would send in the National Guard should protests continue. тАЬAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,тАЭ he said of the rising protests in Minneapolis at the time. Twitter quickly appended a note to the tweet, saying it violated rules about glorifying violence. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? HereтАЩs how.",1,3,1,3
5335,BLM Protests Spark calls for Dixie Chicks to Change Their Name,"Following weeks of protests about police brutality and racism, many activists have begun calling out the band Dixie Chicks to change their name, claiming the word тАЬDixieтАЭ harbors тАЬthe epitome of white America.тАЭ The Dixie Chicks, a band composed of Natalie Maines and twin sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer, is a country band that was started in 1989. The Chicks soared to popularity until a comment by Maines about President George W. Bush in 2003 sent their career on a downward spiral from which it never fully recovered. In London for a concert, Maines told the crowd in 2003, тАЬWeтАЩre ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.тАЭ They were instantly dropped from multiple country radio stations and boycotted by most of their fans. With the announcement of a comeback album called тАЬGaslighter,тАЭ slated to release in July 2020, the band was asked about changing its name because of the alleged racial connotations tied to it. According to dictionary.com, the word тАЬdixieтАЭ describes тАЬthe southern states of the United States, especially those that were formerly part of the Confederacy.тАЭ The origin of the word тАЬdixieтАЭ being used to describe the southern states is unknown, but some believe it could have been after Jeremiah Dixon, one of the men who established the Mason-Dixon Line, or after тАЬdixтАЭ which was the name of a Louisiana $10 bill before the Civil War. Other theories are that it could have come about due to the song тАЬDixieтАЭ that was written by Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859, or that a slave owner named тАЬDixтАЭ was so kind to his slaves that when they left, they had fond memories of living in тАЬDixieтАЩs Land.тАЭ Variety has a different approach, saying that dixie is тАЬthe epitome of white America, a celebration of a Southern tradition that is invisible from Black Slaves and those grand plantations where they were forced to toil for free.тАЭ As of this writing, the Dixie Chicks have not released a statement regarding their name. The Chicks are not the only band that has been pressured to make a name change. Popular country band and five-time Grammy award winners Lady Antebellum recently changed their name to Lady A because of the meaning of тАЬantebellum.тАЭ The band, comprised of Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood, posted a statement on its Instagram page. It partly reads, тАЬWe feel like we have been Awakened, but this is just one step. There are countless more that need to be taken. We want to do better. We are committed to examining our individual and collective impact and making the necessary changes to practice antiracism.тАЭ The word тАЬantebellumтАЭ is Latin and means тАЬbefore the war.тАЭ While it seems vague, many agree that it is referring to the Civil War specifically. While the bandтАЩs name change was met with some praise, not everyone was happy. Rogan OтАЩHandley, a lawyer and journalist, tweeted, тАЬI would love to say IтАЩm now boycotting Lady Antebellum b/c of their cowardice, but I never liked their music anyway.тАЭ тАЬLove your music. Now it is tainted to me forever. How easy it is to follow the sheep,тАЭ one fan said. Another fan responded to the news, тАЬYep IтАЩm out. You just donтАЩt have what it takes. You took a knee and bowed under pressure.тАЭ Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com. CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.

5348,Trump's False Statements About How Democratic Leaders Handled Protests - FactCheck.org,"By Rem Rieder and D'Angelo Gore Posted on June 1, 2020 President Donald Trump has made false statements and implications about how three Democratic officials responded to violent protests that followed George FloydтАЩs death in police custody in Minneapolis: The inaccuracies come as the president has scolded state and local officials, often singling out Democrats, for not being tough enough in dealing with protests. In a conference call June 1, Trump told the nationтАЩs governors they were тАЬweakтАЭ and said they needed to act more aggressively in quelling violent behavior. The president, in a series of tweets May 30, praised the Secret Service for its work protecting the White House as an unruly crowd of more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the White House early that morning. At the same time, Trump charged that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser wouldnтАЩt let the D.C police help protect him. Trump, May 30: On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldnтАЩt let the D.C. Police get involved. тАЬNot their job.тАЭ Nice! But the D.C. police were involved in the protection during the tumultuous protest, as this Washington Post article makes clear. тАЬBowser and D.C. police Chief Peter Newsham said city police had in fact joined with Secret Service and U.S. Park Police on Saturday to control the demonstrators on Pennsylvania Avenue, even supplying the Secret Service with extra protective gear,тАЭ the article says. The Post also said its reporters covering the protests saw that D.C. Police were there. And the Secret Service said in a statement about the episode, тАЬThe Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.тАЭ Trump also was off-base on May 31 when he tweeted that Philadelphia officials should call in the National Guard to help deal with widespread looting in the city, suggesting their failure to do so reflected a general weakness in the way Democrats dealt with civil unrest. But the guard had been called in hours before TrumpтАЩs 4 p.m. tweet. Trump, May 31 tweet: Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. The guard was already on the way. At a noon press conference of city officials that day, Philadelphia Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said, тАЬWe have requested support from the Pennsylvania National Guard.тАЭ At a 6 p.m. press conference, Philadelphia Managing Director Brian Abernathy reiterated that the National Guard was en route and was expected later that night. He said the guardтАЩs role would be to support the local police and act as a тАЬforce multiplier.тАЭ National Guard troops began arriving in Center City Philadelphia around 1 a.m. June 1 and were on patrol by dawn. Trump also suggested тАФ falsely тАФ that members of MinnesotaтАЩs National Guard didnтАЩt arrive in Minneapolis to assist local and state law enforcement control crowds until the evening of May 30. тАЬCongratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night,тАЭ Trump tweeted May 31. тАЬThe ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!тАЭ At least some Minnesota National Guard soldiers and airmen had been deployed to Minneapolis for duty the night of May 28. Early that day, after a second day of demonstrations in Minneapolis over FloydтАЩs death became increasingly violent, including looting, fires being set and a fatal shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey officially declared a local emergency and called for the stateтАЩs National Guard to be deployed to his city. (FreyтАЩs office told us he actually asked for that help May 27, as the Star-Tribune reported.) But it was up to MinnesotaтАЩs governor, Tim Walz, to authorize the activation of the stateтАЩs National Guard, which he did by signing an executive order the afternoon of May 28. (At a roundtable discussion with business executives May 29, Trump left the inaccurate impression that he had called in National Guard troops to Minneapolis, saying тАЬwe brought in the National Guard today.тАЭ) After Walz signed the order, the Minnesota National Guard tweeted late on May 28 that it had тАЬactivated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities.тАЭ ItтАЩs true that Walz called for a fuller mobilization of the guardтАЩs soldiers and airmen on May 30. In a tweet late that day, the Minnesota National Guard said, тАЬWe now have more than 4,100 тАФ quickly moving toward 10,800 тАФ Minnesota Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen supporting our friends and neighbors in the Twin Cities.тАЭ That was тАЬa significant increase over the 700 on-dutyтАЭ as of May 29, the tweet said. A public affairs official for the guard told us that about 7,000 members had been deployed as of June 1. EditorтАЩs Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

5453,"18-Year-Old Activist Had Teeth Knocked Out By Police At Columbus Statue Protest, Officials Say","Become a member Learn more Activist Miracle Boyd of GoodKids MadCity was injured by police in an attack caught on video. """"You beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue?"""" Ald. Jeanette Taylor said. GRANT PARK тАФ An 18-year-old activist who had just spoken to a crowd protesting at the Christopher Columbus statue in Grant Park had several front teeth knocked out by a Chicago Police officer Friday evening, according to video and multiple elected officials. An outraged Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) said Miracle Boyd, 18, of the group GoodKids MadCity was assaulted by a police officer during the tense Friday night protest where police pepper-sprayed protesters trying to tear down a towering, nearly 90-year-old statue of Columbus. Taylor, who knows Boyd, said the rising young activist was injured by police. Boyd was filming the encounter, in which she argued with officers away from the Columbus statue. At the end of her recording, her phone appears to be knocked away. A second video, posted to Twitter from someone filming across the street, shows an officer wearing shorts and a bike helmet swinging his left hand at her. She flees after he swings. .@chicagosmayor we now have the video of Miracle being sucker punched by CPD! They donтАЩt keep us safe!

TaylorтАЩs daughter is good friends with Boyd. тАЬIтАЩm going to tell you right now, if this was my kid тАФ and Miracle is one of mine тАФ I would burn this city to the ground,тАЭ Taylor said. тАЬYou beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue? тАЬTheyтАЩre so busy protecting white supremacy, theyтАЩre so busy protecting a Christopher Columbus statue that they beat her.тАЭ On Sunday, Boyd told Block Club she had been trying to assist a protester she saw being arrested when two officers approached her, one with dark gray facial hair and sunglasses. тАЬHe walked up to me and smacked me,тАЭ Boyd said Sunday. тАЬI donтАЩt know if the phone hit me in the mouth, I donтАЩt know if his hand hit me in the mouth. тАЬBut the way that I was recording, I think that he tried to smack the phone in my hand and he hit me at the same time, and the phone hit me in the mouth, and it knocked my tooth out and I was bleeding.тАЭ RELATED: Protesters Try To Tear Down Columbus Statue In Chicago As Clashes Between Police, Activists Turn Violent GoodKids MadCity tweeted in the aftermath, showing Boyd suffered multiple injuries to her face and chipped teeth. They later tweeted the video footage they said showed a police officer beating Boyd in the face. Essence Gatheright, a 16-year-old member of Chicago Freedom SchoolтАШs youth leadership board who was at the protest, said Boyd spoke at the rally earlier that night. Gatheright helped get Boyd get medical attention at the Freedom School after she was hit. тАЬHer teeth came out, it was really bad,тАЭ Gatheright said. тАЬShe was bleeding, she kept crying and sobbing. It was a really messed up situation. тАж We were able to walk her and others to the school and provide her with support and make sure she got home safely.тАЭ Ald. Taylor said Boyd is тАЬa good kid, a CPS graduateтАЭ who has helped raise money for the most vulnerable in her community. тАЬI donтАЩt care if you become the president, the mayor, the garbage man тАФ you are not exempt from this country and what its racist ass will do to you,тАЭ Taylor said. Through tears, Taylor said she was tired. тАЬHow many more times are we going to go through this?тАЭ State Sen. Robert Peters posted the photo of BoydтАЩs injuries, saying he had just offered her an internship last week because she is тАЬfighting gun violence everyday.тАЭ тАЬShe is just over 5 ft, 100 pounds.

She said more policing is not the answer and demanded that Mayor Lori Lightfoot divest from the Chicago Police Department and direct the money to communities instead. тАЬWeтАЩre the people of the community. I donтАЩt see you [Mayor Lightfoot] out here organizing people,тАЭ Boyd said. тАЬтАж We are the ones in our community that have to deal with the trauma.тАЭ She was recently featured in a Block Club Chicago story about the Washington Park protest. She also co-wrote a story about activism in Injustice Watch. Friday eveningтАЩs protest ended in in clashes between police and demonstrators, some of whom attempted to pull down the statute of Christopher Columbus in the southern edge of the park. Police eventually converged on the area, using pepper spray to push back protesters. Video tweeted from reporters and demonstrators shows multiple physical confrontation. In a statement, the Chicago Police News Affairs office said it was not aware of the Boyd incident. тАЬThe Chicago Police Department strives to treat all individuals our officers encounter with respect,тАЭ according to the statement. тАЬWe do not tolerate misconduct of any kind and if any wrongdoing is discovered, officers will be held accountable. Anyone who feels they have been mistreated by a CPD officer is encouraged to call 311 and file a complaint with COPA, who will investigate allegations of misconduct.тАЭ During the protest last week in Washington Park, Boyd and other activists detailed proposals about reducing violence in their communities, calling on the city to reallocate 2 percent of the Chicago police budget to services like robust mental health, schools and grocery stores. That money would help support violence interrupters and other residents doing ground-level work to keep communities safe through direct action with gang members. Peace treaties, accountability, trauma-healing and a restorative justice process are all part of the plan, Boyd said. You can donate to help Boyd with needed medical care here.

ATLANTA тАФ Protesters caused extensive damage to the Georgia State Patrol headquarters in Atlanta early Sunday by sparking flames inside the building with fireworks, breaking windows and spraying graffiti, the agency said. Department of Public Safety workers put out the fire, and two employees were treated for smoke inhalation, Georgia State Patrol Lt. Stephanie Stallings said in a statement. One of the agencyтАЩs vehicles parked in front of the building was also damaged. Video showed several dozen people outside and the sound of drums being played in the background.

5580,Florida Sheriff floats deputizing all gun owners in county to battle protests,"A Northeast Florida Sheriff facing a competitive primary used department resources to make a self-promotional video this week under the guise of combatting civil unrest. The message to would-be protesters: тАЬYouтАЩve been warned.тАЭ (The message to political opponents, meanwhile, is one of the power and prerogatives of incumbency, especially in a crowded field of candidates.) Clay County Sheriff Darryl Daniels released Tuesday a red meat video vowing to, if needed, deputize gun owners in the event Black Lives Matter protesters came into the county. тАЬSomebody has to step up in front of the camera and say тАШenough is enough,'тАЭ said Daniels, vowing that тАЬif we canтАЩt handle you тАж. IтАЩll make special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county.тАЭ The warning (not a тАЬthreat,тАЭ Daniels says repeatedly), is especially interesting, given that Camp Blanding, from which the National Guard could deploy as it did during riots in actual cities, is in the county. The three-minute video is full of the kind of bluster that traditionally plays well in Clay. тАЬIf you threaten to come to Clay County and think for one second weтАЩll bend our backs for you, youтАЩre sadly mistaken,тАЭ Daniels said. тАЬYou can threaten all you want, you can say тАШletтАЩs go to Clay CountyтАЩ,тАЭ but тАЬyouтАЩll have something waiting for you you donтАЩt want,тАЭ he added. тАЬThe second you step out from under the protection of the Constitution, weтАЩll be waiting for you, and youтАЩll have everything you want. All the publicity, all the pain, all the glamour and glory, for all that five minutes will give you,тАЭ Daniels promised, in a video that plays up contrasts between Clay County and urban areas, with a little flash for Fox News should they pick it up. тАЬGod is absent from the mediaтАЩs message or Black Lives Matter or any other group out there thatтАЩs making themselves a spectacle,тАЭ Daniels theorized. Wherever God is or isnтАЩt, Daniels himself picked up earned media at the right time, running fourth in the money race for the August primary. Daniels, who has $38,514 on hand, trails opponents Ben Carroll, Michelle Cook, and Mike Taylor. Cook said Daniels was acting like a тАЬreality show sheriffтАЭ and called the video a тАЬpolitical scam.тАЭ However, in a seven-way race, the ability to leverage the public resources with the needs of a corporate media starved for any content that affirms the social order has a value that wonтАЩt show up in campaign finance, but could show up in October. Despite an FDLE investigation dating to last summer, polling this spring showed Daniels well positioned in August, with strong approval numbers. This video probably wonтАЩt hurt those numbers. A.G.

They need economic upheaval in order to beat TrumpтАжand thatтАЩs when the fun really begins. The true goal is to eliminate the Electoral College so States like New York and California dictate who runs the country.

That of course brings us to the crux of the problem hereтАжProtecting your homes, family, and neighbors are simply unacceptable to them. These are the same people not 6 months ago were screaming for you to disarm. First it was we just want the AR-15тАЩsтАжthen they wanted all тАЬassault rifles,тАЭ and finally they claimed everyoneтАЩs semiautomatic weapons was their true target. Any real gun owner will tell you that 95% of all firearms in the US are semiautomatic. Then the so called тАЬpeaceful protestsтАЭ broke out. Seattle was having their very own Woodstock love in.

You had the warlord of Chaz (never call it Chop) handing out AR-15тАЩs to drug addicts, felons, and 14 year old children (itтАЩs been recorded).

ItтАЩs only a matter of time before they make a stop in your town. Addendum- тАЬAssult rifleтАЭ is a made up buzzword from the Clinton era. The тАЬprotestersтАЭ are anything but peaceful.

5644,Portland Protests: A 'Wall Of Moms' And Leaf Blowers Against Tear Gas : Updates: The Fight Against Racial Injustice : NPR,"Laurel Wamsley As protests for racial justice in Portland have continued for more than 50 nights, striking new images and tactics have emerged тАУ particularly in resistance to the federal law enforcement officers whose actions have earned the ire of Oregonians who want them to leave. A group of women who call themselves the Wall of Moms has drawn national attention, clad in bike helmets and goggles. They link arms to form a protective barrier between law enforcement and Black Lives Matter protesters who took to the streets after the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. In a recent moment captured on video, a large crowd of the yellow-garbed women sing as if a lullaby, """"Hands up, please don't shoot me."""" Moms sing lullaby тАЬhands up please donтАЩt shoot meтАЭ pic.twitter.com/GJhj8ymn12 Members of the Wall of Moms say they follow the directions of Black leaders, and that their driving vision is that """"we moms would take some physical hits in hopes our Black and Brown kids, friends, neighbors, and loved ones will be spared some pain."""" In another video, also taken by freelance journalist Sergio Olmos, a protester uses a hockey stick to push back a canister of tear gas. Another uses a leaf blower to blow back the gas, a tactic used last year by protesters in Hong Kong. A protester uses a hockey stick to swing tear gas canister back, another uses a leaf blower pic.twitter.com/GSdFeErinC State and local leaders have repeatedly called for federal agents to leave the city, arguing that their presence has made an already-tense environment worse. """"The federal police have their marching orders on how they're going to do things,"""" Portland Police Association President Daryl Turner told NPR on Tuesday. """"And that coordination was not made with Portland police."""" In response to both the federal actions in Portland and the implied threat by President Trump to deploy federal officers to other U.S. cities, more than a dozen U.S. mayors have sent an open letter to Attorney General William Barr and Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The letter calls on the Department of Justice and DHS to withdraw the forces from American cities and halt plans to send any more. """"Deployment of federal forces in the streets of our communities has not been requested nor is it acceptable. While U.S. Marshals have had jurisdiction inside federal courthouses for decades, it is unacceptable and chilling that this administration has formed and deployed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Rapid Deployment Unit and is sending federal authorities to conduct crowd control on city streets and detain individuals,"""" the mayors write. They point to the federal officers' use of less-lethal munitions against protesters that have caused serious injury and to the grabbing of people off the street and pulling them into unmarked vehicles. """"These are tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes тАУ not our democracy,"""" the mayors write. On Tuesday, Wolf said, """"Portland is unique,"""" arguing that local officials and police hadn't done enough to control what he said was violence stemming from the nightly protests, and saying those protests increasingly threaten federal buildings downtown. Asked about Trump's threat to send federal officers into other cities, Wolf said reporters could """"ask the White House."""" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the situation in Portland had been starting to calm before federal forces arrived. """"The harsh reality is, this is about scoring political points with [Trump's] base,"""" Brown told PBS NewsHour on Monday. """"This is about political theater. If they were really interested in problem-solving or in public safety, they would be willing to de-escalate and engage in dialogue."""" She added, """"Instead, they bring more troops to the streets. They take peaceful protesters off into unmarked cars. And, unfortunately, last weekend, they almost killed a peaceful protester. This is absolutely outrageous.

5649,Multiple churches ├втВм╦Ьburned and vandalized├втВмтДв across US as cops investigate possible links to statue protests,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. A NUMBER of Catholic churches have been torched and vandalized in the US as cops investigate whether this is linked to the ongoing statue protests. Houses of worship are being burned after George Floyd's police custody death in Minneapolis on May 25, which sparked widespread outrage and anti-racism rallies. Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King urged demonstrators to """"tear"""" down Jesus Christ statues and murals because he said they are """"a form of white supremacy"""" on Twitter. While Confederate monuments are being taken down all over the country, Christian statues are reportedly being vandalized and churches have been set on fire. In the city of Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mission, a 249-year-old Catholic church, was engulfed in flames in the early hours of Saturday morning. CNN reported that firefighters and emergency responders fought the blaze for three hours as the ancient ceiling and roof began to cave in. The church was preparing to mark its upcoming 250th anniversary celebration before the alleged arson attack, causing severe water and smoke damage. It came under criticism because of the surrounding statues of St Junipero Serra, which have been toppled by BLM protesters in other areas. Critics say the 18th-century Franciscan priest was complicit in an imperial conquest that oppressed Native Americans. """"One of the factors investigators are taking into account is the recent vandalism to the statues of the saint, specifically in the Los Angeles region,"""" San Gabriel Fire Department fire captain Antonio Negrete said. тАЬThis will be another box that theyтАЩre going to check off,тАЭ he told Fox11. """"It's a tragic loss for our city. It's our city identifier."""" Elsewhere, in San Diego, the police departmentтАЩs Metro Arson Strike Team are investigating a """"suspicious"""" 12.30 pm blaze at Calvary Baptist church on Sunday. Although it's a historically Black church, it has become a тАЬmulti-cultural faith community,"""" as per its website. Around the same time as the LA blaze, a man in Florida mowed his vehicle into the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala ahead of morning Mass on Saturday. Steven Anthony Shields, 24, from Dunnellon allegedly poured gasoline in the foyer, set the building on fire, and drove off, as per the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was arrested and charged with attempted murder, arson, burglary, and evading arrest. Shields described the incident as """"awesome,"""" saying he was on a """"mission"""" as he smiled and laughed, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Ocala Star-Banner. He cited issues with the Catholic Church but Shields also reportedly has schizophrenia and isn't taking his medication. Nevertheless, Mass was celebrated Saturday and Sunday, local outlets said, despite the damage to the foyer. Elsewhere, Missouri authorities are looking into a suspected arson attack in Johnson County, where a 100-year-old church went up in flames. Harmony Baptist Church was burned to the ground at 11.22 pm on July 5, according to Johnson County Fire Protection District. It took over two hours for firefighters from four stations and 50,000 gallons of water to get a handle on the raging blaze, which caused between $400,000 and $500,000 of damage. Security camera footage shows the arson suspect parking outside and then entering the building before setting the building alight, local reports said. тАЬThe loss of the historic church will have a lasting effect on the rural community and members of the church,"""" Fire Chief Larry Jennings told The Sun. """"It will take a community effort to identify those responsible for the fire and to help the congregation as they move forward.тАЭ It isn't known if this arson attack is connected with the ongoing protests and Jennings said there is no current evidence to suggest it is related as the probe continues. But it's not just churches that are going up in flames. In Massachusetts, cops are investigating a suspected arson attack on a statue of the Virgin Mary on Saturday night. Catholic News Agency reported that the statue is located outside St PeterтАЩs Parish in BostonтАЩs Dorchester neighborhood. Police responded to a fire on Bowdin Street at around 10 pm on July 11. The statue of Mary sustained heavy damage after an unknown individual set fire to the plastic flower's in the statue's hands. This caused smoke and flame damage to the face, head, and upper body of the statue. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Boston described the unknown culprit as """"a troubled soul.""""

5834,FEMA denies Minnesota├втВмтДвs request for aid for protest cleanup,"Minnesota, youтАЩre on your own. About a week after Gov. Tim Walz wrote to President Trump requesting federal aid to repair widespread damage in Minneapolis and St. Paul from the fiery George Floyd protests, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rebuffed the request for a financial helping hand. The state has estimated total damages at more than $500 million, and Walz specifically wrote in his July 2 letter that $15 million in cleanup and repair costs could be eligible for federal reimbursement. тАЬThe governor is disappointed that the federal government declined his request for financial support ... to help Minnesota rebuild after civil unrest damaged public infrastructure and caused extensive fire damage in the wake of George FloydтАЩs death,тАЭ spokesman Teddy Tschann said in a statement. тАЬAs we navigate one of the most difficult periods in our stateтАЩs history, we look for support from our federal government to help us through,тАЭ he said. Hundreds of buildings in the Twin Cities were destroyed by fires, looted or damaged during the nightly protests following FloydтАЩs May 25 death beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis cop. A local police precinct was among the structures torched during the demonstrations. Walz noted in his letter that it was тАЬthe second most destructive incident of civil unrest in United States history after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.тАЭ The governor noted the state budget was further crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an anticipated $1.5 billion surplus morphing into a projected deficit of $2.4 billion. FEMA, in a statement provided to Minnesota Public Radio, said the turndown came after a тАЬthorough reviewтАЭ of the stateтАЩs request for the funds as a major disaster area. тАЬIt was determined that the impact to public infrastructure is within the capabilities of the local and state governments to recover from,тАЭ the statement concluded. Minnesota officials now have 30 days to appeal the federal rejection, with the governorтАЩs spokesman saying his office was тАЬexploring more optionsтАЭ to resolve its dire financial situation.",1,3,0,0
5842,Black Lives Matter protest organiser Paddy Gibson among those arrested as police shut down Sydney rally,"A Black Lives Matter rally, billed to attract thousands in Sydney, was shut down by police before it began and its organiser arrested. The event in The Domain, which almost 5000 people had registered on Facebook to attend, came to nothing as NSW Police ordered protesters to disperse, 15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin at midday on Tuesday. See police shut the protest down in the video above Hundreds of police were on duty at the park and six arrests were made. Of the six, five were fined $1000 each and a sixth person, a 25-year-old woman, was issued a criminal infringement notice for offensive language. Organiser Paddy Gibson was one of those arrested and said supporters were asked to gather in groups of fewer than 20 after they failed on Monday to overturn a NSW Supreme Court decision prohibiting the protest. Gibson said organisers directed protesters to leave peacefully and without confronting police after being told mass arrests would otherwise occur. He said heтАЩd been told by police that despite The DomainтАЩs size, only 20 people would be permitted in the park. тАЬWe werenтАЩt allowed to give it a run even though Westfield is allowed, as well as the casino and the NRL,тАЭ the 37 year old said. тАЬPeople are allowed to come together to make profits but theyтАЩre not allowed to come together to say black lives matter - thatтАЩs a disgraceful situation in NSW. тАЬThey donтАЩt want to see us build unity, build power, demand accountability and demand justice from this government because itтАЩs too politically sensitive.тАЭ Gibson said protesters would challenge any fines handed out. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing warned that protesters who intended to rally outside NSW parliament on Tuesday would be arrested. Justice Mark Ierace on Sunday accepted the police argument that the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19 arising from the Sydney rally made the event too risky. The appeal court, which will hand down its reasons soon, on Monday dismissed a challenge to Justice IeraceтАЩs decision. Organisers previously said they would risk arrest and go ahead with the rally before delivering a 90,000-strong petition to NSW Parliament calling for justice for Indigenous man David Dungay Jr. Mr Dungay, aged 26 and a diabetic, died in December 2015 after five prison officers stormed his Sydney jail cell to stop him eating biscuits. Premier Gladys Berejiklian had earlier appealed to тАЬpeopleтАЩs conscience and ethical standardsтАЭ not to attend.

5999,"When the American public thinks the US military has assumed a law enforcement role in quelling protests, 'It creates the perception that the U.S. military is being used to suppress the American people,' said retired Marine Col. David Lapan.","'They need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.' By Jeff Schogol | Published Jul 25, 2020 2:02 PM You can be forgiven for thinking that U.S. troops have been dispatched to the streets of Washington, D.C., Portland, and other cities in recent weeks. The news has been rife with concerning videos and images of little green men kitted out with military gear as they confront тАУ and sometimes beat тАУ protesters, including at least one U.S. Naval Academy alumnus. var siteRootDomainParts = window.location.host.split("""".""""); var siteRootDomain = window.location.host; if ( siteRootDomainParts.length >= 2 ) { siteRootDomain = siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 2] + """"."""" + siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 1]; } cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: """"3c020dea-a94e-40a8-be0a-8a3170cc7c1b"""", customParam1: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId + """""""", customParam2: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + """""""", customParam3: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + """""""", settings: { advertising: { macros: { cust_params: """"site="""" + siteRootDomain + """"&targeting_article="""" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.externalId + """"&targeting_section="""" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + """"&targeting_keyword="""" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + """"&article="""" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, article: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, category: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section, keywords: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords, } } } }).render(""""404a5343b1434e25bf26b4e6356298bc""""); }); But the U.S. government has not declared martial law. The people wearing military camouflage uniforms тАУ and, in some cases, carrying M4 carbines тАУ are from federal law enforcement agencies. They are border patrol officers, U.S. Marshals, and other civilian police officers. They are not U.S. service members, no matter how much they may resemble them. тАЬWhen people who have served in the military for a long time have to look very hard at the photos and video from Portland and places like that to tell who these individuals [federal agents] are, then the average citizen is going to easily confuse what they see as a militarized response rather than a law enforcement one,тАЭ said retired Marine Col. David Lapan, a former spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of Homeland Security. Indeed, some media outlets have erroneously referred to federal officers as troops тАФ and that misperception that the military has assumed a domestic law enforcement role is bad for democracy, according to Lapan тАЬIt creates the perception that the U.S. military is being used to suppress the American people.тАЭ Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters on Wednesday that border patrol officers are wearing camouflage in Portland because thatтАЩs the uniform they wear when they are deployed to the southwestern border. тАЬThat is their everyday uniform and it is completely appropriate,тАЭ Wolf said at a news briefing. тАЬThey have insignia on their uniforms that read police and they have patches тАж that indicate which agency they are from.тАЭ Related: Stop what you're doing and watch this interview with the badass Navy vet who went viral in Portland Meanwhile, the U.S. Marshals in Portland who are wearing military uniforms belong to the agencyтАЩs Special Operations Group, said U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman Michelle Coghill. тАЬSOG relies on established Department of Defense research to ensure the best economic value for taxpayers and a high level of protection for its personnel, and sometimes procures specialized equipment also used by U.S. military forces, including uniforms, helmets, gas masks and protective gear for tactical operations,тАЭ Coghill told Task & Purpose. The Defense Department doesnтАЩt just provide equipment to the U.S. Marshals Service. Under the 1033 Program, the Defense Logistics Agency transfers a variety of excess military equipment to local police departments, including MRAP-All Terrain Vehicles. Related: A West Virginia town of 8,400 people just picked up an MRAP for some reason However, both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have stated that police should be distinguishable from U.S. service members so that the general public does not mistakenly think the military is performing law enforcement duties. The issue first arose during protests in Washington, D.C., in June after National Guardsmen and some federal authorities appeared in similar uniforms, Milley told the House Armed Services Committee recently. тАЬYou want a clear distinction тАУ visually тАУ visual distinction between that which is police and that which is military because when you start introducing [the] military, youтАЩre talking a different level of effort there,тАЭ Milley said during the July 9 hearing. During the 15 years that IтАЩve had the honor to tell service membersтАЩ stories, IтАЩve learned that troops have no desire to serve as a national police force on American soil. As one crusty noncommissioned officer told me years ago, the militaryтАЩs mission is тАЬto go to where the terrorists live and fтАУk up their neighborhoods.тАЭ Still, active-duty troops have been used in response to civil unrest in the past, such as during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. It is also true that service members take an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic. If thatтАЩs the case, then why is it bad for democracy if Americans have a hard time distinguishing between domestic law enforcement agents and troops? One reason is that the public is generally not in favor of blurring the lines that separate the roles of police and the military, Lapan said. And while the Oath of Enlistment mentions domestic enemies, it was changed around the time of the Civil War because the Southern states had launched an insurrection. Related: Army grounds crew of helicopter that flew low over protests amid official investigation тАЬI think the context of тАШdomestic enemiesтАЩ lends itself more to the idea of someone that would try to overthrow the government,тАЭ Lapan said. тАЬWeтАЩre talking about that type of activity, not protests тАУ not even criminal activity.тАЭ Normally, U.S. troops are used for humanitarian missions inside the United States, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Lapan added. In fact, when Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honor├й took command in New Orleans following the devastating 2005 hurricane, one of the first things he did was instill in every first responder that they were not in a war zone. тАЬPut those damn weapons down,тАЭ Honor├й barked at both troops and police officers alike. тАЬI'm not going to tell you again, goddamn it! Get those goddamn weapons down!тАЭ Related: Meet the former soldier who gave National Guardsmen in DC an impromptu phalanx lesson in this viral video Now retired, Honor├й was just as blunt when he told Task & Purpose that federal law enforcement officers have misappropriated military uniforms in order to look intimidating. тАЬLaw enforcement should not be wearing military uniforms,тАЭ Honor├й said. тАЬMilitary uniforms are designed to blend into the terrain and itтАЩs a function of identifying our soldiers on the ground. The police need to stay in their lanes.тАЭ He also said he doesnтАЩt buy WolfтАЩs explanation that the border patrol is just wearing their normal uniforms. тАЬThatтАЩs bullshit,тАЭ Honor├й said. тАЬThey need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.тАЭ тАЬSWAT teams, sheriffтАЩs office, border patrol, go get your own goddamned uniforms,тАЭ he said. тАЬThereтАЩs nothing that a camouflage uniform can do for you in an urban operation other than [to] portray a sense of authority that you are big, you are bad, and you are armed.

Anti-mask rallies at CalgaryтАЩs Olympic Plaza and outside the Alberta legislature in Edmonton drew crowds Sunday afternoon as the province continues to deal with the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. In Calgary, the rally was held in response to city councilтАЩs upcoming deliberations on mandatory mask usage. Read more: Could masks become mandatory in Calgary? Mayor isnтАЩt ruling it out On Monday, city council is slated to begin discussions on whether masks should be mandatory on transit and some indoor areas where physical distancing measures canтАЩt be followed. A rally against mandatory masks is underway at Olympic Plaza.

Mayor Naheed Nenshi, alongside health and government officials, has repeatedly stressed the importance of wearing a mask when in a crowded indoor space. However, as more businesses continue their operations, Nenshi noted the need is bigger now than ever to stop a resurgence of the virus so the city can continue to rebuild its economy. тАЬItтАЩs not mask-wearing or the economy. ItтАЩs wearing a mask to save the economy,тАЭ Nenshi said Thursday. A crowd also gathered in Edmonton, where protesters carried signs with slogans disparaging mask use. In a news conference Saturday, Premier Jason Kenney also addressed the anti-mask rallies. He noted that while some residents have their reservations about wearing masks, the alternative outcome of a second wave could have devastating effects on the province. тАЬMy pitch to those folks, if theyтАЩre upset about mask usage, is that that the alternative will inevitably be more widespread suspensions of economic activity if we get a second outbreak,тАЭ he said. тАЬI think the responsible exercise of personal freedom through mask usage, where people cannot physically distance, is a lot better than suspending businesses or social activity.тАЭ A protest against making the use of face masks mandatory is underway at the #AbLeg. #YEG pic.twitter.com/8jcYAqL0qS тАФ Chris Chacon (@ChrisAChacon) July 19, 2020  Kenney added that while his government doesnтАЩt want to strong-arm the public into wearing face coverings, he hopes residents will take the threat of the virus seriously. тАЬAll it takes is the exponential growth of a highly-infectious virus of this nature for it to perspectively come back and overwhelm our health care system,тАЭ Kenney said. тАЬI would much rather that we prevent that through the widespread use of masks rather than the government big-footing in and suspending the operation of all sorts of businesses that would have massive social and economic consequences.тАЭ But Eskesen is concern about other social consequences. тАЬThere are so many people out there that have issues with masks for different reasons, one being claustrophobia. People who are claustrophobic can get a lot of anxiety over wearing a mask, same with people with other anxiety issues, people on the spectrum,тАЭ he said. тАЬPeople with spectrum disorders can have a lot of issues with masks, not just wearing them but interacting with people who have them on, it makes them uncomfortable a lot of the time.тАЭ Read more: Masks in the mountains: Banff considers mandatory face coverings during COVID-19 pandemic With Calgarians expressing their concerns for mandatory face mask policies at SundayтАЩs rally, Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, noted that many peopleтАЩs reservations on the subject stem from тАЬconspiracy theoriesтАЭ and inaccurate information.

6180,Rep calls for withholding of transporting funding if protests on highways continue,"A Minnesota Representative and trucking company owner is asking federal authorizes to withhold transportation funding if cities continue to allow protests to occur on highways. In a Facebook video, Minnesota Rep. Cal Bahr said that he sent letters to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Gov. Tim Walz, Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner Margaret Anderson Kelliher and Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington requesting they withhold funding transportation if cities continue to allow protests on highways. тАЬToday I sent a letter to Attorney General Barr and Governor Walz urging them to put an end to allowing protesters to gather on our interstates. In the past few months, we have seen two of our primary interstates blocked by protesters, putting many lives in danger. The lack of penalties for these actions has encouraged others to protest in this same way,тАЭ the Facebook post states. тАЬI encourage you, your office, along with other federal agencies, to use every tool at your disposal up to and including withholding federal funds if these actions are allowed to continue.тАЭ тАУ Rep. Cal Bahr, the Facebook post states. In his letter, Bahr, a CDL holder and trucking company owner, referenced the May 31st incident that involved a tanker truck encountering protesters on the highway. тАЬAs someone who has a commercial driverтАЩs license myself, I know firsthand how dangerous this situation is for all concerned. On May 31st, a fuel hauler named Bogdan Virechko was trapped on the I-35W Bridge, blocked by protesters, which MNDOT had failed to secure properly. MNDOT has cameras everywhere along that road, and knowing that they had been unable to restrict traffic in that area, they allowed protesters to block it anyway. тАЬThe situation could have resulted in many deaths but for the actions of Mr. Virechko, who was beaten by protesters and jailed for his trouble. I donтАЩt need to tell you that allowing situations like this to develop in Minnesota and other states strike at the heart of our interstate commerce system and our rights as citizens to move freely about the country and engage in transactions of all kinds. We are just coming out of a significant supply chain disruption due to the GovernmentтАЩs response to COVID-19. The federal government was founded to protect us from these types of local disturbances, and I ask you to intervene to uphold the law to protect commerce at this most basic level,тАЭ the letter states.

6224,Little evidence that protests spread coronavirus in US,"NEW YORK (AP) тАФ There is little evidence that the protests that erupted after George FloydтАЩs death caused a significant increase in U.S. coronavirus infections, according to public health experts. If the protests had driven an explosion in cases, experts say, the jumps would have started to become apparent within two weeks тАФ and perhaps as early as five days. But that didnтАЩt happen in many cities with the largest protests, including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. In whatтАЩs considered the first systematic look at the question, a team of economists determined that only one of 13 cities involved in the earliest wave of protests after Memorial Day had an increase that would fit the pattern. It was Phoenix, where experts say cases and hospitalizations surged after a decision by Gov. Doug Ducey to end ArizonaтАЩs stay-at-home order on May 15 and eased restrictions on businesses. Arizona residents who were cooped up for six weeks flooded Phoenix-area bar districts, ignoring social distancing guidelines. In many cities, the protests actually seemed to lead to a net increase in social distancing, as more people who did not protest decided to stay off the streets, said that studyтАЩs lead author, Dhaval Dave of Bentley University. тАЬThe large-scale protests can impact both the behavior of the protesters and the behavior of the non-protesters,тАЭ said Dave. The paper was released last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, but has not been published by a peer-reviewed journal. Drawing from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, The Associated Press reviewed trends in daily reported cases in 22 U.S. cities with protests. It found post-protest increases in several cities тАФ including Houston and Madison, Wisconsin тАФ where experts say other factors were more likely the main drivers. Health officials are still investigating case surges in different states, and more data may come in. But experts believe that if the protests did have a big impact on cases, stronger signs would be apparent now. Floyd was killed on May 25 by a Minneapolis police officer who used his knee to pin FloydтАЩs neck to the ground. The killing of a Black man at the hands of a white officer touched off protests around the United States. Coincidentally, some states had begun to lift social distancing restrictions in late May. Dave and his colleagues counted protests over three weeks in 281 cities with populations of at least 100,000. Most had protests lasting more than three days, and many had protests that had at least 1,000 participants. It's not clear how many protesters participated, let alone how many of them wore masks or got tested after. That may have varied from place to place. Houston is among a number of Texas cities that have recently seen steep increases in cases and hospitalizations. Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the county health department, believes it was likely some cases could be traced to the protests. """"We just don't know how much,тАЭ he said. But it's hard to measure the protests' precise impact for a number of reasons, Shah and others said. Earlier business reopenings and more willingness to shrug off social distancing guidelines started the trend in the Houston area, Shah said. Another factor: Many people don't get tested unless they feel symptoms. Many protesters were young adults, who generally are less likely to get severe illness, and therefore may not have gotten tested, experts said. And some who do get tested may still not answer all the questions they are asked by outbreak investigators. тАЬI know of three people who told us тАШYes, I was at a protest.тАЩ That doesn't mean there was not another 25 or more who did attend a protest and just did not share that with us,"""" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, the public health commissioner for the city of Columbus, Ohio. That city has seen increased cases in the last month, but health officials say they can't attribute it to any particular reason other than people socializing and returning to normal activities without wearing masks or taking other precautions. So far, protests don't seem to be a real factor. тАЬMost of the protests, at least in my jurisdiction, were outside,тАЭ and the virus does not spread as well outside, Roberts said. """"And I would say 50% of those at the protests were wearing a face mask."""" ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical InstituteтАЩs Department of Science Education.

6369,Frankie Banali Dead: Quiet Riot Drummer Dies at 68,"Getty Franki Banali, the drummer for the band Quiet Riot, died on August 20, 2020 at age 68. Frankie Banali, the drummer for the heavy metal band Quiet Riot and W.A.S.P, died on August 20, 2020, as reported by his wife, Regina Banali. He was 68. On April 17, 2019, Banali was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer and was given six months to live. тАЬHe put up an inspiringly brave and courage 16-month battle to the end,тАЭ his wife wrote in a statement. In November 2019, Banali opened up about his diagnosis. He said his decision to keep performing live stemmed from the fact that he had тАЬeverything to win and everything to lose in this situation. I intend to treat it the way I treat everything, which is to put everything into it and fight it all of the way to the end.тАЭ Regina shared some of BanaliтАЩs biggest career moments as a musician in her statement. She wrote that Banali was тАЬmost known for his lengthy career as the drummer for that multi-platinum heavy metal band Quiet Riot whose тАШMental HealthтАЩ was the first heavy metal album to reach number one on the Billboard chars and ushered in the 80s metal band era.

This is only possible because of the generous support of our members. We rely on these funds to pay our staff to continue to provide high-quality content. If you are able to support, we invite you to do so here. Protests erupted in Wisconsin following the shooting of an unarmed Black man by Wisconsin Police. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by Kenosha Police Department officers in front of his children on August 23 following a domestic violence call. Kenosha police officers were responding to a domestic incident near 28th Avenue and 40th Street around 5:11 p.m, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Attorney General. Jacob was trying to break up a fight between two women when he was tased and then shot by police, The Kenosha News reported. In a graphic video posted on social media, two officers are seen following Jacob to a gray van with their weapons drawn. As Jacob enters the vehicle, one of the officers is seen grabbing and pulling on JacobтАЩs shirt and shoots multiple shots into his back. A woman in the video is seen frantically screaming and jumping up and down following the shooting. The 29-year-old was sent to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition, according to The Kenosha News. NBA Agent and JacobтАЩs childhood friend, Daniel Poneman, wrote on Twitter that Jacob was out of surgery and currently in the ICU fighting for his life. тАЬHe is out of surgery and in the ICU. He can make it through this. He is fighting for his life. Please please please pray for Jacob Blake,тАЭ Poneman wrote. https://twitter.com/DanielPoneman/status/1297750493498941441 The attorney general stated that the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ), Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI), is investigating the shooting and the officers involved were placed on administrative leave as of August 24. Following the shooting, demonstrators gathered outside the scene of the shooting to protest, WDJT-TV reported. The city of Kenosha issued a city-wide curfew until 7 a.m. on August 24 because of the protests. """"It goes back to the Emmett Tills. We're tired of it. Rodney King. We're tired of it. And right now, this is the wrong generation that this is happening to. The frustration is boiling to the top and we're sick and tired,"""" said Clyde McLemore, founder of Black Lives Matter of Lake County, Illinois, told the news station. The shooting comes just days after the fatal police shooting of Trayford Pellerin in Louisiana and anti-racism protests following multiple police-involved deaths. Who is Jacob? Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Jacob and his family, posted on Twitter that he is a father whose three sons witnessed the shooting while sitting in the backseat of the vehicle Jacob was trying to enter. тАЬJacob BlakeтАЩs 3 SONS were IN THE CAR he was getting into when @KenoshaPolice shot him tonight.

Text to Speech CNN -- the network where Brian Stelter preaches that the Republicans and Fox News are guilty of """"asymmetric lying"""" -- was dramatically bending reality in the 5 am hour on Tuesday. On Early Start, they went live to correspondent Omar Jimenez, who described the images of buildings ablaze as being in тАЬstark contrastтАЭ to the events going on in the daylight, тАЬwhich were largely peaceful demonstrations.тАЭ The chyron was unbelievable: """"FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING"""". Before turning to Jimenez, co-host Laura """"daughter of Valerie"""" Jarrett explained """"There were protests in several other cities yesterday as well, most of them peaceful, although an officer was attacked with a cane in San Diego."""" OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Laura, what you're seeing is one of multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the course of the night, a second night since Jacob Blake was seen shot in the back seven times by a police officer. And what you are seeing now, these images came in stark contrast to what we saw over the course of the daytime hours in Kenosha and into the early evening, which were largely peaceful demonstrations in the face of law enforcement. It wasn't until night fall that things begun to get a little bit more contentious. Things were thrown back and forth. Police started using some of those crowd dispersal tactics like tear gas, even playing really loud sounds to push them. And then what you're seeing, a common theme that ties all of this together is an expression of anger and frustration over what people feel really like has become an all too familiar story playing out in places from across the country not just here in Kenosha, Wisconsin -- Christine, Laura. Jimenez is the 26-year-old CNN reporter who was wrongly arrested by police in Minneapolis during the George Floyd-spurred rioting. CNN then turned that mistake into an ad about their own heroic riot coverage. As Tristan Justice at The Federalist noted, Jimenez was also the reporter on scene on Monday's Situation Room where the CNN chyron was briefly accurate -- тАЬ8PM Curfew Ordered After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In WisconsinтАЭ -- until they nixed the V-word after a few seconds.

121,"Athens community rallies around local street artist after tips, supplies stolen","CLARKE COUNTY, Ga. тАФ If you've ever visited Athens, you may have run into a disabled street artist with an incredible talent. He recently became the target of a thief trying to make some quick cash. Now, the Bulldog community is stepping in to help. Channel 2тАЩs Tom Regan talked to the artist about the overwhelming kindness. """"I just look at my art as a blessing from God,тАЭ Michael Davenport said. Davenport says he discovered his artistic talent in the wake of a terrible tragedy. While playing outside at age 13, he grabbed some cables that he didnтАЩt know were electrified. тАЬA high voltage power line, 75,000 went through me. I was a little kid trying to be Spider-Man that day,тАЭ Davenport said. He lost both of his hands, but two years later, he discovered something he never knew he could do. тАЬSo, I started writing with my mouth, and became an artist,тАЭ he said. For decades now, he's been sketching bulldog portraits for University of Georgia fans. But last week, police say, someone got out of a van and stole nearly $60 that Davenport had collected from his sketches. He was on a bathroom break. тАЬI (came) back out, I noticed my red donation bowl was gone,тАЭ he said. The thief also took his art supplies. But like his art, there was beauty in the response of those whoтАЩd heard about what happened. More and more people including Christa Perry started showing up to buy his unique sketches. тАЬHe's been around forever, and everybody loves him,тАЭ Perry said. A manager at the motel where Davenport lives set up a GoFundMe fundraiser for the artist. The fundraiser page says that the manager received countless phone calls about people wanting to help pay for DavenportтАЩs stay at the hotel, prompting the manager to help Davenport setup a savings account and then the GoFundMe. It says it is to тАЬhelp him get back on his feet.тАЭ It has raised more than $37,000 in donations as of Saturday morning. Caring and generous neighbors have donated thousands of dollars already. Davenport says he is grateful to all who show they care. тАЬIt made me feel good inside and let me know God (does) hear some prayers,тАЭ he said. Davenport says he hopes his art provides joy and inspiration to others, especially to children. тАЬIтАЩm just trying to show everyone you can be the best you be, with hands or without hands,тАЭ he said.   ┬й 2020 Cox Media Group ┬й 2021 Cox Media Group.

Titled Un violador en tu camino in Spanish, it was composed by a Chilean feminist collective and performed in Santiago in 2019, against the backdrop of widespread anti-government protests. Since then, the song has gone viral, inspiring women around the world to generate their own versions. In Kolkata, it was translated into Bengali and named Dhorshok Tumii. A group of women connected over social media decided to perform it. After a fortnight of rehearsals, mostly in Jadavpur University, the collective performed it for the first time on January 4, outside the cityтАЩs iconic New Market. When it was learnt that Modi was going to come to Kolkata, the collective decided to repeat their performance. тАЬWe wanted to highlight the patriarchal violence that ModiтАЩs idea of a Hindu Rashtra represents,тАЭ said Aopala Banerjee, one of the women who had performed the anthem on Saturday told Scroll.in.

330,Joaquin Phoenix Arrested During A Jane Fonda Climate Change Protest,"Jane FondaтАЩs weekly climate change protests have attracted quite the assortment of Hollywood figures, including Ted Danson and Sam Waterton, who have all been willing to be arrested to draw attention to climate change. This week, Fonda found herself marching on Capitol Hill next to recent Golden Globe winner Joaquin Phoenix, who Fonda claims that she didnтАЩt personally invite but тАЬcame of his own volition!тАЭ He recently (and shambolically) praised the HFPA for offering vegan cuisine at their fancy ceremony. In the process, he also asked his fellow actors to stop taking private jets to film festivals, and he made his points again in D.C. on Friday. тАЬI struggle so much with what I can do [to fight climate change] at times,тАЭ he said in this video tweeted by The Hill. тАЬThere are things that I canтАЩt avoid тАФ I flew a plane out here today, or last night rather.

But one thing that I can do is change my eating habits."""" pic.twitter.com/RaZILYq0La тАФ The Hill (@thehill) January 10, 2020  PhoenixтАЩs general argument is that the mass adoption of a vegan diet would help ease environmental woes, but he was warned (as were all activists) to disperse from the area, which they apparently refused to do. TMZ was among the first to report that Phoenix, soon after making this speech, came under arrest by D.C. police. Martin Sheen, who has played a few U.S. presidents (fictional and otherwise, in The West Wing and a Kennedy miniseries), got nabbed as well. Deadline then confirmed the news. Prior to this development, the Washington PostтАШs Hannah Jewell posted some photos and videos while quipping that тАЬthe joker is going to be arrested on the steps of the capitol.тАЭ As far as anyoneтАЩs aware, Phoenix did not do Arthur FleckтАЩs dance at any point prior to his arrest.

404,Buhler community rallies around high schooler paralyzed after crash,"A 16-year-old boy is paralyzed after a car accident Friday in Reno County, according to the family. Deputies say a small pickup truck was traveling westbound on east 4th Avenue when the driver lost control on slick roads and veered into a ditch. The pickup then rolled several times. Raiden Stewart was trapped inside. Hutchinson firefighters extracted Raiden from the pickup, and he was taken to Wesley Medical Center for treatment. His mother, Tara Stewart, says her son Raiden had surgery Saturday. She says he is paralyzed from the chest down and has limited arm movement. He fractured his spinal cord and will most likely not be able to walk again. He also has damage to his vertebral artery. Stewart says her son is a Buhler High School junior who is part of the wrestling and football team. He just took first place at the Douglas Varsity Wrestling Tournament and recently took second place at the Abilene Varsity Wrestling Tournament. Raiden's coaches say he inspired people on the football field and on the wrestling. While the prognosis is difficult, they say Raiden is already making strides in his recovery. """"His mental toughness will probably help carry him along as well. Not just his physical strength,"""" said Buhler wrestling coach, Mike Zeyen. """"He has a big heart,"""" said Buhler High School head football coach, Steve Warner. """"He knows he can handle it and he's going to fight."""" Warner said a lot of students have traveled to see Raiden and his family. His mom is asking for thoughts and prayers in this difficult time. After he is released from the hospital, Raiden will go to a spinal rehabilitation center in either Denver or Omaha. Family and friends have set up a to help with expenses. There is also a fundraiser, set for Tuesday (Jan. 21) from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Spangles located at 120 east 4th Avenue (Hutchinson). Some of the proceeds will be given to the family.",0,0,0,0
416,Pakistani far-right activists sentenced over blasphemy protests,"Eighty-six sentenced for violent protests after 2018 acquittal of a Christian woman in blasphemy case. Islamabad, Pakistan тАУ A Pakistani court has sentenced 86 members of a far right religious party to 55-year prison terms each for taking part in violent protests against the acquittal of a Christian woman in a blasphemy case, party officials say. The verdicts were announced late on Thursday night by a court in the northern garrison city of Rawalpindi, Pir Ejaz Ashrafi, a senior leader of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA) party, told Al Jazeera. The 86 TLRYA activists were arrested in November 2018, as the party led violent protests against the acquittal by the countryтАЩs Supreme Court of Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman who was on death row for having allegedly committed blasphemy in 2009. Days of protests saw TLRYA activists тАУ led by party leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi тАУ block big highways and destroy public property across the country, but mostly centred in the central province of Punjab. At the time, senior TLP leader Pir Afzal Qadri had called for the judges who announced the acquittal to be killed. The charges against those sentenced include destroying public property, attacking passers-by and disrupting citizensтАЩ everyday life. Ashrafi said the sentences were тАЬharshтАЭ and that his party would be appealing the decision at the high court. тАЬThis is the murder of justice. We are hopeful that they will suspend the verdict in the high court, and our legal team is working on it,тАЭ he told Al Jazeera by telephone from the eastern city of Lahore, where the TLYRA is based. Bibi, a Christian woman from the central Pakistani village of Ithan Wali, was accused by two Muslim women of having committed blasphemy by insulting IslamтАЩs Prophet Muhammad during an argument over a drinking water vessel in 2009. She spent eight years on death row, with rights groups arguing that there were numerous fair trial concerns in her case, as are commonly reported in most blasphemy prosecutions in Pakistan. In 2018, the Supreme Court acquitted Bibi, ruling that prosecution witnesses had lied to implicate her. In May, she flew to Canada where she was forced to seek asylum to guarantee her and her familyтАЩs safety after the verdict. Blasphemy against Islam is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where the crime can carry a mandatory death sentence. Increasingly, accusations have led to violent attacks by mobs or assailants, with at least 75 people killed in such attacks since 1990, according to an Al Jazeera tally. Two of those killed тАУ a sitting federal minister and a serving provincial governor тАУ were attacked for having supported Bibi during her trial. Last month, a court in the central city of Multan sentenced university lecturer Junaid Hafeez to death for blasphemy after a six-year trial. Hafeez has spent most of his incarceration in solitary confinement due to threats against his life, his lawyer says. One of his lawyers, Rashid Rehman, was murdered in 2014 for defending him. The TLYRA has publicly endorsed violence in the name of the blasphemy laws, with a regular chant at protests such as the November demonstrations for which the activists were sentenced on Thursday calling for all blasphemers to be beheaded. Rizvi, the TLYRA chief, is currently out on medical bail as he faces charges of inciting hatred and violence at the rallies. His brother, Ameer Hussain Rizvi, and nephew are among those who were sentenced on Thursday, Ashrafi said. Asad Hashim is Al JazeeraтАЩs digital correspondent in Pakistan. He tweets @AsadHashim.

581,Iran says it has made arrests over plane disaster after days of protests," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News TEHRAN тАФ IranтАЩs judiciary said Tuesday that it had arrested an undisclosed number of suspects involved in the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 aboard last week. The announcement came after days of protests shook Iran, with demonstrators railing against the governmentтАЩs initial attempts to deny involvement in the downing of the plane. Thirty people were arrested during the demonstrations, a judicial spokesperson, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said at a news conference Tuesday. Esmaili gave no further details on the number of those arrested in connection with the downing of the passenger jet and did not reveal their names or professions. He also said that the planeтАЩs black box had been taken to France for the data to be read and that more information would be released. But FranceтАЩs bureau of aviation investigation confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that no black boxes had been sent to France and nor were they expected to be. Canada's transportation safety board had said Monday that the black boxes were damaged and remained in Iran. """"We haven't seen the extent of the damage, but extracting the data will pose some technical challenges for the Iranian investigating team,"""" the head of the board said. Iran initially denied allegations that a missile had struck the plane shortly after it took off last Wednesday from Tehran, the capital, only to reverse course on Saturday and admit that it had shot down the jet by mistake. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Twitter Saturday blamed тАЬhuman errorтАЭ for the тАЬhorrific crash.тАЭ Over the weekend, the U-turn prompted Iranian protesters to take to the streets demanding that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei step down. Rouhani said that one person could not be held responsible for the downing of the plane and called for a special court to investigate. Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, said the way in which the government and the establishment handle the broader repercussions of the incident could be a """"watershed moment for Iran."""" """"The choices it makes are likely to reverberate throughout Iranian politics and society for months, or even years, to come,"""" she wrote in an analysis piece for the BBC. Britain, France and Germany said Tuesday that they were triggering a dispute mechanism that is part of the nuclear deal with Iran, citing its failure to live up to terms of the pact. The foreign ministers of the three nations said in a statement that they were """"left with no choice, given Iran's actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments."""" But, they added, their countries would not join a campaign to implement maximum pressure against Iran and hoped that parties to the nuclear accord would find a way forward to resolve the impasse and preserve the agreement. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers eased international sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in May 2018 and imposed economic sanctions on the country's oil industry, as well as banking and other key sectors. Amin Hossein Khodadadi reported from Tehran, and Saphora Smith from London. Nancy Ing contributed from Paris, Oksana Parafeniuk from Kiev, and Tom Costello from Washington.

756,CAA Protest in Khureji Khas Delhi: Women in Khureji Khas Quit Jobs to be Part of Anti-CAA Protest,"More than 1,500 women have joined the sit-in protest against the CAA at DelhiтАЩs Khureji Khas. ItтАЩs a gloomy afternoon. The absence of the sun can be felt as the frigid air stings our cheeks. Undeterred by the biting cold, hundreds of women have been gathering at Khureji Khas since 18 January to register their dissent against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Chants of тАЬhum ek haiтАЭ (we are one) linger in the bamboo tent, which is decorated with posters and national flags. While Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, a similar sentiment has been echoing among women at Khureji Khas. The movement, which started as a small awareness campaign seeking to put an end to the misinformation, has now grown into a key anti-CAA protest site. Around 1,500 women have been participating at this peaceful gathering on all the days. One of them is 28-year-old Mehnaaz Sheikh, who recently quit her job. Mehnaaz, a resident of Khureji, was an English teacher at a private school. On being asked about her familyтАЩs reaction over her decision, she replies, тАЬEven though my family is financially stable, I have always wanted to be independent. This is a sacrifice I made for my country,тАЭ she adds. While sharing her experience, Mehnaaz is offered tea by a girl. Braving the winter cold, she holds the paper cup between her palms to absorb its warmth. Just like Mehnaaz, 32-year-old Sadaf, who was working as a receptionist in a private firm, put down her papers. She had to convince her family to let her work in the first place, but after seeing the dadis of Shaheen Bagh, she too decided to quit. Sadaf has been participating in protests across the city ever since. тАЬI stay at these protests all night. I barely know people in my locality, but these women have now become a part of my family,тАЭ she says. Thirty-year-old Nazia is another woman who decided to leave her job to participate in the protests. Like Mehnaaz and Sadaf, she too says that quitting her job was a sacrifice she made for her country. тАЬFor me, the world revolved around work and home, but for these protests, I have been staying out till 5 am. In these 30 days I have seen parts of Delhi I had never heard of.тАЭ There is hardly any place to walk inside the tent. There is a makeshift stage where women wait for their turn to address the crowd. Everyone greets each other with hugs and broad smiles. For a lot of these women, convincing their families to let them work had been a difficult task.While there are many male relatives at the protest site, these women do not fear defying gender roles for a larger cause. They juggle between participating in protests and completing household duties, no matter how sleep deprived they feel. Naima, a homemaker, rocks her sleeping baby in her arms. She says she wishes to give her child a future where his loyalty towards the country will not be questioned. As she participates in the protest for 12 hours, her household duties, she says, have taken a backseat. Several attempts have been made to malign and discredit the protest at Khureji Khas with rumours doing rounds that the women were paid to protest. Shama, a middle-aged woman, dismisses these allegations. тАЬI have everything, why would I come here for money,тАЭ she asks. Overhearing our conversation, a woman from the back shouts, тАЬIтАЩll give them Rs 2,000 if they (ministers) are willing to come here and hear our ordeal!тАЭ She recounts news from her hometown in Muzzafarnagar and tears up. KhurejiтАЩs women have faced criticism with many saying that the protests have resulted in traffic jams and caused disruption of movement. To shield protests at Khureji, committees were formed to ensure the smooth functioning of the demonstrations. тАЬWe have legal, medical, traffic, security and stage committees,тАЭ says Amaantullah, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia. As we exit the tent, chants of тАШAzaadiтАЩ resonate in the air, reminding us of an India that is led by its women.

908,"Via Rail cancels most trains nationwide, CN closes Eastern Canadian network as Indigenous protests continue | CBC News","CN Rail and Via Rail are shutting down huge sections of their railway networks as Indigenous blockades continue to cripple the country's transportation systems. Via Rail is temporarily ending most passenger services nationwide, expanding an earlier work stoppage that restricted train cancellations to the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor. """"Via Rail has no other option but to cancel all of its services on the network, with the exception of Sudbury-White River (CP Rail) and Churchill-The Pas (Hudson Bay Railway), until further notice,"""" the rail operator said in a media statement. The company said it would automatically process full refunds for all cancelled trips. """"You do not need to contact Via Rail to confirm the refund, but note that due to the volume of transactions it may take up to 15 days to receive,"""" the Crown corporation said. """"We understand the impact this unfortunate situation has on our passengers and regret the significant inconvenience this is causing to their travel."""" CN Rail, the country's largest railway, is """"initiating a progressive and orderly shutdown of its Eastern Canadian network"""" because Tyendinaga Mohawk protesters near Belleville, Ont. have so far refused to dismantle their blockade. The railway operator said the shutdown, which will affect the entire network east of Toronto, may result in temporary layoffs of CN workers. Teamsters Canada, the union which represents over 16,000 workers in the rail industry, said Friday the shutdown could lead to roughly 6,000 layoffs. Via Rail trains run on CN tracks in most parts of the country, a vestige of a time when CN ran its own passenger trains. """"With over 400 trains cancelled during the last week and new protests that emerged at strategic locations on our mainline, we have decided that a progressive shutdown of our Eastern Canadian operations is the responsible approach to take for the safety of our employees and the protestors,"""" J.J. Ruest, the president and CEO of CN, said in a media statement. """"This situation is regrettable ... these protests are unrelated to CN's activities and beyond our control. Our shutdown will be progressive and methodical to ensure that we are well set up for recovery, which will come when the illegal blockades end completely."""" Last weekend, CN Rail obtained a court injunction to end the illegal Mohawk demonstration. The injunction has been ignored by the protesters. Activists also ignored a request from the on-reserve Tyendinaga Police for them to voluntarily dismantle the blockade. The injunction forbids any continued interference with the rail line under the threat of arrest. The Ontario Provincial Police has not yet enforced the injunction. The federal government, which has jurisdictional authority over railways, has so far refused to intervene. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller has agreed to meet with the Mohawks on Saturday. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he plans to meet with his provincial and territorial counterparts Friday, adding he is in contact with CN and CP. In a statement Thursday, Garneau said """"freedom of expression"""" is an important democratic right, but added, """"these activities must respect the court decisions and the law."""" The Mohawk activists have said they won't end their demonstration until the RCMP leaves the traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en in northern B.C. Wet'suwet'en hereditary leaders had been blocking road access to a construction site for the Coastal GasLink pipeline, a key part of a $40-billion LNG Canada liquefied natural gas export project. While much of the police action near that road ended Tuesday with multiple arrests, the RCMP still has officers stationed near the pipeline construction site. A separate rail blockade on CN tracks near New Hazelton, B.C. was set to end today after Gitxsan hereditary chiefs agreed to end protests designed to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett and her provincial counterpart will hold talks with both the Gitxsan and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs in the coming days. A prolonged shutdown could have devastating consequences for the country's economy. CN moves more than $250 billion a year in goods across its transcontinental network. The shutdown threatens the transport of food and consumer items, grain, de-icing fluid for airports, construction materials, propane supplies for Quebec and Atlantic Canada, and natural resources like lumber, aluminum and coal, the railway said. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the federal and provincial governments and the police to immediately end the transport chaos and help CN restore rail service. """"From propane to grain and food and consumer items, Canada's supply chains are being severely damaged by the continuing interruptions to Canada's rail services by protestors,"""" the organization said in a statement. """"The rail system affects the entire Canadian economy and Canadians everywhere, including people trying to get to and from work. They must be allowed to continue to serve the thousands of businesses that depend on them."""" Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, said this shutdown could be hugely problematic. """"It's a critical situation. It's an extremely dire situation for the economy and, in the coming days, for communities across the country,"""" he told CBC's Power & Politics. He said 80 per cent of his industry's products, such as jet fuel for planes and chlorine for drinking water, are shipped by rail. Masterson said the provincial police need to enforce the court-ordered injunction and clear out the Mohawk protesters. """"Everyone has the right to protest ... but the courts have said, 'You've gone too far, it's no longer in the public interest,'"""" he said. """"The actions are illegal, this is trespassing.

957,Shaheen Bagh protest site seen empty as AAP all set to return in Delhi,"It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the governmentтАЩs move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats. The Congress party, on the other hand, seems to be on its way to acquire another duck. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1008,Community rallies to give local Vietnam veterans with no living relatives a proper funeral,"FOX 4 Kansas City WDAF-TV | News, Weather, Sports by: Sean McDowell  LEAVENWORTH, Kan. тАФ ItтАЩs a tragic sign of the times. Many U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War era are passing on, and some are passing on with no remaining relatives to bury them. On Thursday, a community banded together to give two fallen patriots a special sendoff. They were unknown to many, but people in Leavenworth wouldnтАЩt let them be forsaken either. Leavenworth National Cemetery hosted around 100 people Thursday to say farewell to retired U.S. Army Prt. Arlen Zimmerman and Spc. Thomas Winstead, two soldiers who served in Vietnam. Both men died since November 2019, leaving no known blood relatives behind. Cars entering the cemetery lined up, carrying people whoтАЩd rallied the effort to ensure Zimmer and Winstead wouldnтАЩt have an empty funeral. тАЬI thought it was just going to be me and my wife. I really did,тАЭ Kansas City resident Mike Pence said. Pence, also a U.S. Army veteran, is believed to be the only person in attendance who knew either man. тАЬI just couldnтАЩt have wished for something better for him. The respect and the ceremony was beautiful,тАЭ Pence said. тАЬThis overwhelmed me.тАЭ Staff members from the Veterans Administration accepted a ceremonial American flag, delivered by a military honor guard, on behalf of WinsteadтАЩs estate. Current and former military members came to share a solemn salute. тАЬThe type of war they faced in Vietnam left them fairly alone in their personal lives and their families, battling addiction or depression,тАЭ U.S. Navy Lt. Houston Benson said. тАЬItтАЩs fairly uncommon for people to be buried alone, but in this particular war, itтАЩs more common than it should be.тАЭ тАЬIt broke my heart because no human being should be buried with no one. I decided they took the call of duty and went, so I thought I could do the same thing,тАЭ Retired U.S. Navy officer Stephen Lopez said. As many as 100 people showed up on a cold afternoon to say goodbye to two men theyтАЩd never met before. Virtually every branch of the U.S. military was represented, members who agreed thereтАЩs something special about the people who came out to pay their respects to these fallen veterans. тАЬWhen youтАЩve been in a war, and you lose so many friends, you know all the guys тАФ maybe not personally, but you live with them. WeтАЩre all the same,тАЭ Lopez added. тАЬHe was an amazing guy. He deserved something incredible like this,тАЭ Pence said. The VA pays for the burial of fallen soldiers as part of their death benefits. However, people in attendance Thursday praised the Muehlbach Funeral Home, which helped coordinate the memorial service.

1287,Protests Spread As The Liberals Show Weakness,"Spencer Fernando Opinion & Insight Amid pathetic weakness by the Trudeau Liberals, we are already seeing more protests.

Weakness invites further challenge, and by refusing to enforce the laws, the Trudeau Liberals have shown immense weakness. Lawbreakers, radical blockaders, have been given reign over our railways, shutting them down with impunity and without consequence. As a result, more and more radicals will be emboldened to violate the law, and the biggest victims of all this will be the hard-working law-abiding Canadian taxpayers who pay the bills for this country.

1371,"Riot August says top lane Soraka is too strong, will receive ""pretty hard"" nerf | Dot Esports","You can choose which categories you want to be notified for. Soraka has taken over the top lane this patch. Over these past few weeks, top lane Soraka has become a strong pick in both the professional and casual League of Legends scenes. Unfortunately for anyone who wanted to try her out, however, Riot Games has already confirmed that it will be nerfing her soon. RiotтАЩs senior champion designer August Browning said that the Starchild has one of the highest win rates of any top lane champion in the game. And as a result, the League of Legends developer will be sending some nerfs to her kit in the upcoming patches. тАЬItтАЩs not like itтАЩs not cool. ItтАЩs cool that characters go to other lanes,тАЭ Riot August said. тАЬBut Soraka top right now has a 56 percent win rateтАжSheтАЩs the strongest champion you can play top except for Sett.тАЭ What makes Soraka so strong in the top lane is her ability to sustain with low mana cost abilities that heal herself for a significant amount. She can negate any trade damage with her QтАЩs self-healing and movement speed, and go relatively even with most top lane champions. Related: Top lane Soraka: An in-depth guide Later on in the game, Soraka is able to hit her inexpensive item spikes a lot sooner, since sheтАЩs soaking up more gold and experience.

1408,Jane Fonda brings climate change protests to Los Angeles,"Jane Fonda had a scheduling problem, the collision of two important parts of a very busy life. The Oscar-winning actor had moved from Century City to Washington, D.C., in September, intent on a mission: to raise awareness of climate change. She protested on the U.S. Capitol grounds in a bright red coat тАФ purchased on sale at Neiman Marcus тАФ was arrested five times, spent a night in jail with a herd of scurrying cockroaches. But she was under contract for the seventh and final season of her comedy series, тАЬGrace and Frankie.тАЭ Being half of the title, she couldnтАЩt just bail. She asked for a hiatus in filming. Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, тАЬlooked at me like I was crazy,тАЭ she said. тАЬHeтАЩs a good guy, but heтАЩd already signed all the contracts.тАЭ Her four months of weekly protests in the nationтАЩs capital, called Fire Drill Fridays, came to an end in January. But they тАЬhad been transformative,тАЭ the 82-year-old told 150 or so mostly millennials Saturday afternoon in West Hollywood. тАЬAnd when the time was coming to an end, I started to get real depressed. IтАЩm going to have to leave and go back to business as usual.тАЭ Which is how the California version of Fire Drill Fridays was born. Starting Feb. 7, Fonda will kick off a series of monthly Golden State protests with a rally on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall. There will be celebrities тАФ Norman Lear and Rita Moreno, among others тАФ speeches, a march and a little civil disobedience at a venue to be named later. Future events are planned for Wilmington, Bakersfield and other cities. Washington had the White House as backdrop, legislators to persuade and a ready army of television cameras. But California is strategic, she told members of The Wing, a womenтАЩs co-working space. Lots of oil extraction, lots of fossil fuel consumption, a reputation as a national environmental leader and a reality that could use some help. тАЬIтАЩm really happy that weтАЩre here,тАЭ said Fonda, urgent and intense. тАЬThis is the place we can really emphasize stopping the drilling and the fracking.тАЭ She said she wants Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an end to new oil-drilling permits in the state. She paused. Smiled. And continued in a conspiratorial whisper: тАЬWeтАЩre meeting with him, by the way, next Thursday.тАЭ The womenтАЩs laughter drowned her out. тАЬOil rules in California. ItтАЩs very hard for politicians to stand up to Big Oil. But thatтАЩs where leaders come from.тАЭ Fonda has spent most of her adult life juggling two full-time careers: as an actor with dozens of movies, documentaries and television shows under her very small belt; and as an activist, supporting womenтАЩs rights, the antiwar movement, the United Farm Workers, the Black Panthers, Native American rights, reproductive rights and the environment, among other causes. Climate change, she said in an interview after the West Hollywood event, тАЬbrings it all together. .... It may look like, in my life and my history as an activist, there have been a lot of different things, [but] theyтАЩre all connected.тАЭ Fonda said sheтАЩs been supporting indigenous rights in tribal country since 1970. Today, she said, much of that same land contains тАЬso much fossil fuel, so much of the materials that the oil companies want to extract, that they are front-line communities now in the war against fossil fuel.тАЭ Annie Leonard is executive director of Greenpeace USA, which is part of the Fire Drill Friday effort. She said Fonda has тАЬa phenomenal ability to draw new people into the movement, especially women over 50. She did [the Washington protests] for 14 weeks. ... Hundreds and hundreds of people came.тАЭ Fonda said she sees herself and other celebrities as тАЬrepeaters,тАЭ the antennae on the tops of mountains that pick up communication signals and transmit them to wider audiences. тАЬI donтАЩt do the science,тАЭ she said. тАЬI donтАЩt do the research. IтАЩm not the wonk. But I can pick up the signals of the people in Wilmington or the scientists in their labs and expand their voices. ThatтАЩs what I think the role of someone like me is.тАЭ Among her biggest regrets, Fonda has said repeatedly through the years, was posing on an anti-aircraft gun during a tour of North Vietnam in 1972, which earned her the nickname Hanoi Jane. She has been proudest, she said Saturday, of Fire Drill Fridays, which are the joy of her ninth decade. тАЬTen thousand people have signed up to take it nationally,тАЭ she said. тАЬI had no idea that this was going to happen. It was an instinct. I may be famous and white and privileged, but when I feel a need for something, I find thereтАЩs usually a whole lot of people who feel the same need. ... With Fire Drill Fridays, the rallies, the civil disobedience, the risking arrest, appealed to a whole lot of people.тАЭ In her daily life, Fonda says, she does her best to be environmentally minded. She bought a Prius when they first appeared and switched to an electric car last year. Meat once a month, fish, twice. No single-use plastics. The red coat she bought for the protest was the last piece of clothing she plans to purchase, she said, with the exception, perhaps, of some underwear and socks. When you see her at the Oscars on Feb. 9, sheтАЩll be wearing a dress thatтАЩs a decade or so old, an Elie Saab number sheтАЩs already worn on the red carpet at Cannes. тАЬI havenтАЩt changed sizes, and I have a closet full of clothes,тАЭ Fonda said. тАЬI donтАЩt need anything. So If I donтАЩt need anything, IтАЩm not going to get it.тАЭ But she wonтАЩt be getting arrested in Los Angeles on Friday. After five arrests in Washington, she was facing possible court dates 2,000 or so miles from the set of тАЬGrace and Frankie,тАЭ community service equally far away. So her lawyer negotiated a deal: She can film in California if she does not engage in civil disobedience for 90 days. Which ends in April. At which time, she said, she plans to hold out her wrists for those zip-tie handcuffs yet again. тАЬOf course,тАЭ she said. Of course.

1485,Trucker Convoy Heads To Salem To Protest Cap And Trade Bill | KXL,"Salem, Ore. тАУ OregonтАЩs timber workers are preparing for a convoy to the Capitol. TheyтАЩll be coming from all over the state, driving to Salem first thing in the morning to protest the new Cap and Trade bill. The bill is aimed at reducing OregonтАЩs carbon emissions, but loggers and other trade workers say the gas tax part of the bill will hit them especially hard. The group Timber Unity on Facebook has about 53,000 members. They believe Oregon can reduce carbon emissions without any new taxes. TheyтАЩll present their own plan to do that today. KXLтАЩs Rosemary Reynolds is talking with truckers at the weigh station in North Plains and will have more on the story throughout the day. Check out these photos from Rosemary:  One couple on their way to Salem this morning is Dawn and her husband. TheyтАЩre longtime small business owners in East county and have never been politically active until now. Dawn tells KXLтАЩs Jacob Dean theyтАЩll be volunteering, helping to setup in Salem later this morning. On the other side of the issue тАУ some Rural Oregonians strongly support the Cap and Trade bill. Meghan Kemple is the Director of the Oregon Climate and Agriculture Network. She says over 250 stake holders like farmers and ranchers from across Oregon have signed a letter in support of the proposal.

1814,Trump refuses to halt rallies as coronavirus surges," Palm Beach (United States) (AFP) - US President Donald Trump signaled Saturday that he has no intention of halting campaign rallies despite surging coronavirus infections, as a case was confirmed for the first time within miles of the White House. The president struck a defiant tone as he spoke to reporters about the outbreak at his Mar a Lago resort in southern Florida, where he was hosting his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro. """"We will have tremendous rallies and we're doing very well, and we've done a fantastic job with respect to that subject,"""" Trump responded when asked if his """"Keep America Great"""" campaign events would continue. Trump's remarks came as the number of cases confirmed across the United States leapt past 400, with 19 deaths confirmed so far, mainly in the west coast state of Washington. Meanwhile health authorities announced the first confirmed case in the nation's capital -- a Washington DC resident in his 50s with no history of international travel and no close contacts with anyone known to be infected. Asked if he was concerned that the virus had spread to within a few miles of the White House, Trump replied: """"No, I'm not concerned at all."""" The president had already insisted as he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday that the risk of having so many people in close proximity """"doesn't bother me at all."""" The CDC warns on its coronavirus web page against people congregating in crowds and encourages the elderly, in particular, to stay home as much as possible. Trump has been holding rallies -- which attract many senior citizens -- at a rate of more than one a week recently, often as counter-programming to Democratic primary contests or debates. However, his website currently indicates """"no events scheduled"""" for the coming days, without giving a reason. Trump has been heavily criticized for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration's own experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus. At a freewheeling news conference at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, the president claimed falsely that tests for the virus were available for anyone who needed one. The event was intended to update the public on the epidemic. Instead, the president made headlines by calling the governor of the worst-hit state, Washington, a """"snake,"""" revealing that he preferred to keep sick Americans on a stranded cruise ship to keep the infection numbers down, complained about CNN and revealed that he was surprised to discover that people could die from the flu. More than 100,000 people have been infected globally by the new coronavirus, with more than 3,500 deaths announced so far, mainly at the epicenter in China. Trump's potential Democratic challengers for the presidency in November, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden have also continued to hold campaign events attracting large crowds during the crisis.

1825,Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant Cancels On Danish Festival To Protest Whaling - Cosmic," Led ZeppelinтАШs Robert Plant has canceled an upcoming G! Festival appearance in protest of an annual whaling practice known as grindadr├бp (the тАЬGrindтАЭ). G! Festival, is a yearly event held at the seaside village of G├╕ta on the Danish archipelago of the Faroe Islands. Coinciding with the festival the Grind sees over a thousand pilot whales and dolphins driven to the shores of local beaches and slaughtered by island residents. While the Grind is a thousand-year-old tradition, the manner in which it is conducted is considered by animal rights activists as appallingly cruel. тАЬWhen whalers locate the whale pods,тАЭ local Rannv├б Johansen has shared of the event to BluePlanetSociety.org, тАЬthey are driven ashore, [which can take] a very long time. The whales then get stressed and the entire whale family can see each other being killed and hear screaming from their babies. They can only wait for themselves to feel the knife.тАЭ Plant was set to perform at the festival on July 18th, However, G! Festival has now announced via its official website that the Led Zeppelin vocalist and new backing outfit Saving Grace will no longer appear after having the cull brought to their attention by environmental advocacy group Blue Planet Society. тАЬWeтАЩre disappointed and annoyed with the cancelation,тАЭ G! FestivalтАЩs managing director Sigv├╕r Laks├б has shared via the events official website, тАЬWeтАЩve been excited and happy with the massive interest and the positive reception to the announcement of Saving Grace, especially the Robert Plant fever that naturally comes with it.тАЭ тАЬIt seems somewhat unprofessional for these acts to pull out of a booking without any prior notice or attempt at constructive dialogue which might have allowed us to address the artistтАЩs concerns,тАЭ Laks├б continues, тАЬIt also appears contradictory when an artist is happy to play in countries like Norway and Iceland [which carry out commercial whaling], which Mr. Plant has done in the past, even in 2019.тАЭ тАЬThis is a severe blow for the festival,тАЭ Sigv├╕r concludes, тАЬwhich forces us to rethink our approach in producing the G! Festival.тАЭ Plant, who has not publicly commented on the cancellation, is not the first major act to cancel an appearance at the festival after having the cull brought to their attention. Pop singer Lewis Capaldi and American rapper Princess Nokia have also declined to appear at the festival in wake of the information coming to light. Fatboy Slim donated his booking fee for the event to marine conservation causes after later being informed. You can sign a petition to end the cull here.

1979,Coronavirus outbreak: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden cancel Cleveland rallies," Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden's presidential campaigns canceled rallies set for Cleveland on Tuesday night due to coronavirus concerns, the first disruptions the outbreak has caused in the 2020 Democratic primary. In separate announcements, the Democratic presidential contenders' campaigns said they exercised caution about holding large public gatherings after hearing guidance from public health officials. Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns thanked supporters who planned to attend the events on a crucial day in the race to decide who faces President Donald Trump in November. In a statement, Sanders communications director Mike Casca said the Vermont senator's campaign will evaluate future events """"on a case by case basis."""" Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said the campaign will """"make announcements about future events in the coming days."""" The Democratic front-runner plans to deliver remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:30 p.m. ET. Asked Tuesday about Trump's plans for future rallies, Vice President Mike Pence said the campaign would make decisions """"literally on a day to day basis."""" He added that he is confident the campaign """"will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward."""" The cancellations come at a pivotal time for the rivals jockeying for position in the Democratic primary. Six states, including crucial Michigan, hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday as Biden tries to amass enough delegates to pull the Democratic nomination out of Sanders' reach. Ohio, which awards a significant 136 pledged delegates, votes next week. Read more: Biden and Sanders' fight over trade is a war for the future of the Democratic Party Questions have swirled about when the outbreak would affect a closely watched and consequential Democratic primary. Mass gatherings where the virus could spread make up a core part of Sanders' strategy. Biden relies less on rallies than his rival. Washington state, one of the areas in the U.S. most affected by the outbreak, holds its primary on Tuesday. While voters cast ballots by mail and will not physically go to the polls and risk spreading coronavirus, the state told voters not to lick envelopes. At least 808 people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus, and at least 28 have died from it, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Got a confidential news tip?

1984,"Trump campaign turning MAGA rallies into slick, locally targeted TV ads","It's the latest way the campaign is working to capitalize on Trump's rallies. Bipartisan concern grows over federal response to coronavirus outbreak While President Donald Trump delivered a fiery speech at his South Carolina rally Friday night, blasting Democrats and defending his administrationтАЩs coronavirus response, his campaign was working to turn the event into a slick, locally focused TV ad that will soon run in the area. ItтАЩs part of the re-election teamтАЩs new strategy to flip the presidentтАЩs sprawling campaign rallies into locally centered TV ads that air days after his road show has left town. The strategy is geared toward further extending the reach and media attention that Trump rallies already generate. The campaign has produced and run six-figure ad buys after rallies in New Hampshire, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado -- with plans to roll run another local ad highlighting Trump's North Charleston rally, a senior Trump campaign official told ABC News. The president tweeted out a version of the South Carolina ad but the campaign hasnтАЩt announced its placement or a buy yet. According to ad service firm CMAG, the Trump campaign placed a $139,000 ad buy in Nevada to run over the next two weeks, and spent $188,760 in Colorado for the week of Feb. 25-Mar. 2. The ads themselves serve as a 90-second highlight reel recapping each rally, carefully curated by the campaign to air in local markets. They promote issues specific to each state like immigration in Nevada and record low unemployment in South Carolina. The Arizona ad features the viral video of a World War II veteran being carried to his seat at the Phoenix Trump rally. The new ads mostly omit the attacks the president heaves at his Democratic rivals, and instead showcase interviews conducted by the campaign with supporters, as well as local news coverage, while sticking mostly to pre-written sections of the president's stump speech -- shying away from highlighting the presidentтАЩs off-script and polarizing moments. тАЬIt is an interesting way to keep the campaignтАЩs message on track,тАЭ Vanderbilt political scientist John Geer, whose research focuses on political advertising, told ABC News. тАЬIt is also an approach that works better for the president, since he often steps on his message.тАЭ Geer also questioned the ads' impact, given that voters' views of Trump are largely set. """"If you consider what happened in South Carolina, Tom Steyer would certainly question the power of ads, in general, to influence the public,"""" Geer said, pointing out that the billionaire massively outspent Joe Biden in the state, only to see the former vice president get four times the vote he did. However, the Trump campaign has said they've yet to fully dive into their planned persuasion ad plan. """"We haven't even really started -- we haven't run $1 of persuasion advertising, really. We've done some but like nothing like what we're going to do over the next six months,"""" a senior Trump campaign official said. And while locally focused ads aren't a new strategy for a presidential campaign, the new ads are the latest way the Trump campaign has found to extend the impact and maximize the return on investment of the president's rallies. тАЬWe just continue to try to get every ounce of value out of the rallies,тАЭ Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News. тАЬWe know there are many thousands of people who were unable to get inside the rally and we want to make sure they could share in the excitement a little bit.тАЭ The campaign views the president's rallies as more than just one-day events. Top surrogates like Vice President Mike Pence or Donald Trump Jr. hold local events in the days leading up to the rally, campaign staff travel the day before and flood the local media markets -- and now, in the days following the event, the campaign runs a local TV ad that was shot entirely at the rally in that market. And with each rally, the campaign also collects troves of data through everything from online ticket requests to selling merchandise inside the arena -- which can sometimes inform the team where to head next. After holding a rally in El Paso, Texas, in early 2019, the campaign said they noticed a large number of supporters coming over from New Mexico for the event -- and a few weeks later the president was in Rio Rancho. While Trump's re-election campaign has traded the retail politics of diner stops for rock concert-style rallies, the president is set to take part in his first town hall of the election cycle next week on FOX News.

2126,Watch: Makro issues lacklustre response as panic-buyers run riot,"Photo: Twitter While we were working, this lot piled up the goods for themselves and went panic-buying in Makro. Not big, not clever, and not what will beat the coronavirus. Photo: Twitter Bad, bad behaviour is this. Hundreds of shoppers have been filmed filling up their trolleys at Makro and emptying shelves at will in a bid to stockpile goods during the coronavirus pandemic. Other department stores have also been hit by the chaos, but the aforementioned retailer became the venue of choice for our hoarders. Honestly, thereтАЩs not much we can say in support of the stockpilers. Especially those who ran to the store during business hours on a Monday. Vital supplies, such as toilet paper, cleaning items and hygeine-related products, have all been mercilessly gobbled up. The aisles have been left bare in several stores. Granted, itтАЩs not exclusively a South African problem. But itтАЩs still enough to tip ordinary South Africans into apoplexy. There will be people who canтАЩt get access to necessary supplies because of MondayтАЩs madness. Makro did issue a statement on their coronavirus procedures, but they made no reference to the stockpilers. тАЬMakro has various measures in place to maintain a clean and healthy environment in our stores, and we have ramped these up even further. we are dedicated to keeping our stores stocked and prices fair. тАЬWe are working especially hard to replenish hand sanitisers, cleaning supplies, paper products, and other in-demand items as quickly as possible and at our everyday low prices.

2144,Large crowd blocks downtown street in protest against mining industry convention | CBC News,"About 200 people took over a downtown street on Sunday afternoon to protest against an annual mining industry convention in Toronto. As police officers watched, the protesters rallied on Front Street outside the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, where delegates had gathered for the opening day of the convention of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada. The protesters held banners, chanted """"Shame!"""" and listened to speakers condemn Canadian mining industry companies for allegedly violating human rights and environmental laws in countries outside Canada in which they operate. """"I think, every day, the ecological crisis gets worse,"""" Kirsten Francescone, a member of MiningWatch Canada, told reporters as the rally got underway. """"We definitely cannot think that more destructive mines that violate human rights and destroy people's environments is our way out of that ecological crisis. I am really concerned that the mining industry is using this space to say that we need mining to save us from climate change. We're here to say that shouldn't be the case,"""" she added. """"We want other kinds of ways forward for a better future for all of us."""" Rachel Small, a member of the Mining Injustice Solidarity Network, said it is important to stand up to what she believes is violence perpetuated by the mining industry. """"We are here in front of the world's biggest mining convention,"""" Small said. """"Toronto is here to say no to business as usual with this industry continuing. We know what the Canadian mining industry looks like. We know that their business as usual is literally leading us to an unlivable planet. We cannot allow this to continue,"""" she said. """"We are here in solidarity with every community around the world that has faced down the barrel of a gun for daring to say no to a Canadian extractive project."""" Small said the protesters came to the rally to disrupt the convention. At one point, the protesters attempted to enter the convention but were stopped by police. They did, however, block different entrances to the building for about an hour. She said the protest was held in part to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline that would cut through their traditional territory in northern B.C. """"Canada is a country founded on the removal of Indigenous people for extractive projects. That's exactly what's happening right now on Wet'suwet'en land and that's exactly what Canadian mining projects are doing all over the world,"""" she added. On Sunday, one chief and senior government ministers said they have reached a proposed agreement over land title but debate continues over the pipeline. The dispute has led to solidarity protests and rail blockades across the country. More than 50 organizations endorsed the rally. Organizers said many of the companies that provide economic support for the Costal GasLink pipeline project in B.C. also take part in the mining convention. Sponsors of the four-day conference include such mining companies as Vale, Hudbay, Barrick Gold, Teck and BHP. The association has 7,500 members. In recent years, the convention has attracted more than 25,000 people from 131 countries.   With files from Natalie Nanowski, The Canadian Press Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

2171,"""Shameless"": Court Shreds UP Over Posters Of Anti-CAA Protest Accused","The Allahabad High Court ordered the hoardings to be removed. The Yogi Adityanath government's """"name and shame"""" campaign came to an abrupt halt today as the Allahabad High Court ordered that all posters and hoardings naming those accused of violence during protests against the controversial citizenship law be immediately removed. Citing the Right to Privacy as a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations as well as the Supreme Court, the judges said the government's move to display photographs and personal details of the accused on roadside hoardings was """"an unwarranted interference in privacy"""". The Lucknow administration has to give a compliance report on the removal to the registrar general by March 16, the court said. Sources said the hoardings тАУ in which the persons named were asked to pay for damage to public property and warned that their property would be attached otherwise -- were put up on instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The High Court had taken up issue on its own, asking the government to explain its position during a rare hearing on a Sunday, a court holiday. Senior advocate KK Rai, who attended the initial hearing at 10 am, said Chief Justice Govind Mathur had made some strong remarks on the issue, saying the government was """"impinging on privacy, respect and freedom"""" and called it an """"illegal move"""". Today, responding to the government's contention that the court """"erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction"""", the judges said, """"Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it"""". The judges said they were not concerned with """"validity of the compensation fastened, but to the act about disclosure of personal details of the accused persons"""". """"In the present case, the cause is not about personal injury caused to the persons whose personal details are given in the banner but the injury caused to the precious constitutional value and its shameless depiction by the administration. The cause as such is undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values,"""" the judgment read.  Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who was one of the people named in the hoardings, welcomed the judgment. Calling the government's move an effort to compromise the rule of law, she said the move of the court sets an example and """"reinforces our faith in the country's constitution"""". """"The damage is already done. This is a digital age. But this is a moral victory for us,"""" said Deepak Kabir, theater artist and another accused in the matter.

2214,Billie Eilish sheds baggy clothes to protest body shaming at tour kickoff,"Eilish's next show is in Orlando, FL on March 10. Billie Eilish kicked off the first leg of her WHERE DO WE GO? World Tour on March 9 in Miami, FL. In addition to rocking the house with a lengthy 22-song set, the 18-year old singer also made a powerful statement regarding body positivity. Billie Eilish dominated 2019. In addition to dropping her debut length record WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? she also became the first woman to ever sweep the four main categories at the Grammys. Eilish has always been outspoken about body positivity and anti-body shaming. Since breaking through, Eilish has rocked her trademark baggy clothes-style. Speaking in a Calvin Kleins ad last May, Eilish explained her reasoning for the fashion choice. тАЬI never want the world to know everything about me. I mean, thatтАЩs why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion because they havenтАЩt seen whatтАЩs underneath. Nobody can be like, тАШsheтАЩs slim-thick,тАЩ тАШsheтАЩs not slim-thick,тАЩ тАШsheтАЩs got a flat ass,тАЩ тАШsheтАЩs got a fat ass.тАЩ No one can say any of that because they donтАЩt know.тАЭ Now, Eilish is continuing her sentiments in a powerful, new video interlude she debuted at the start of this tour. The video occurred just before Eilish kicked into тАЬall the good girls go to hell.тАЭ In it, we see Eilish dressing down until sheтАЩs in her bra while a voice-over delivers a тАШmust-hearтАЩ message. тАЬDo you really know me? You have opinions about my opinions, about my music, about my clothes, about my body,тАЭ Eilish begins. тАЬSome people hate what I wear, some people praise it. Some people use it to shame others, some people use it to shame me. But I feel you watchingтАж always. And nothing I do goes unseen. So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sighs of relief, if I lived by them, IтАЩd never be able to move.тАЭ тАЬWould you like me to be smaller? Weaker? Softer? Taller? Would you like me to be quiet? Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest? Am I my stomach? My hips? The body I was born with, is it not what you wanted? If what I wear is comfortable, I am not a woman. If I shed the layers, I am a slut.тАЭ тАЬThough youтАЩve never seen my body, you still judge it and judge me for it. Why? You make assumptions about people based on their size. We decide who they are. We decide what theyтАЩre worth. If I wear more, if I wear less, who decides what that makes me? What that means? Is my value based only on your perception? Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?тАЭ Watch the fan-shot video below. я╗┐ As stated, Eilish performed a staggering 22-song set that included her recent James Bond theme тАЬNo Time To Die,тАЭ in addition to the hits from her body of work. Check out the full setlist below, as well as other fan-shot videos of the concert. тАЬbury a friendтАЭтАЬyou should see me in a crownтАЭтАЬmy strange addictionтАЭтАЬocean eyesтАЭтАЬCOPYCATтАЭтАЬWHEN I WAS OLDERтАЭтАЬ8тАЭтАЬwish you were gayтАЭтАЬxannyтАЭтАЬThe HillтАЭ (Mark├йta Irglov├б cover)тАЬlovelyтАЭтАЬlisten before i goтАЭтАЬi love youтАЭтАЬilomiloтАЭтАЬbellyacheтАЭтАЬidontwannabeyouanymoreтАЭтАЬNo Time to DieтАЭтАЬwhen the partyтАЩs overтАЭтАЬall the good girls go to hellтАЭтАЬeverything i wantedтАЭтАЬbad guyтАЭтАЬgoodbyeтАЭ я╗┐ я╗┐ Eilish has a long way to go before the Where Do We Go Tour?

2282,"USWNT protest, invisible crest T-shirts become a record hit","Last week, an indelible protest by the U.S. womenтАЩs national team against the U.S. Soccer Federation turned into a viral business opportunityтАФand showed exactly how rabid the fan base for the USWNT really is. BreakingT is a company that makes moment-driven sports apparel, the kind that can jump on fan interest in real time to sell T-shirts and sweatshirts immediately after games. The company got the license for the USWNT Players Association ahead of World Cup 2019, and it had success selling shirts during the tournament like Rapinoe-Bird 2020, a nod to Megan Rapinoe and her partner, WNBA star Sue Bird. (BreakingT also has the license for the WNBA players union.) But what happened last week during the SheBelieves Cup put those World Cup sales figures to shame. It started with Christen PressтАЩs bending golazo against England. BreakingT immediately put out a shirt bearing the likeness of Press and the call from ESPN broadcast Sebastian Salazar: тАЬCHRISTEN PRESS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?тАЭ тАЬThat sold really, really well,тАЭ said BreakingTтАЩs director of marketing, Dom Bonvissuto. тАЬAnd it just continued to shine a light on the fact that womenтАЩs soccer and its fans are super-passionate and exactly the right fan base to hit with this model. Then on Wednesday night we saw that the women walked out with their warmups inside out. And we were obviously struck immediately by the empty shield with the four stars. ThatтАЩs a shirty thing. We need to get going.тАЭ The USWNTтАЩs protest was elegant in its simplicity. Two days earlier, new filings in the USWNT playersтАЩ gender-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer had been released in which the federation argued that womenтАЩs players inherently had less skill, ability and responsibility than menтАЩs players, which is why women were paid less than men. The legal strategy might have been useful in a court of law, but it was offensive and objectionable on a massive scale. Several U.S. Soccer sponsorsтАФCoca-Cola, Budweiser, Deloitte, VolkswagenтАФissued strongly worded statements excoriating the federation. Meanwhile, the USWNT spoke with action. On game day, the players came up with a plan. Wearing their pregame warmups inside out made invisible the U.S. Soccer badge and left only the badgeтАЩs outline and the four stars above it, representing the teamтАЩs four World Cup victories. It was the perfect symbolism, a way to show the abject emptiness of the U.S. Soccer Federation while still honoring the players who have led the U.S. to its greatest soccer triumphs. The U.S. players only reinforced that point by having every single player on the team pose unsmiling in those shirts for the pregame photo that usually just includes the starting 11 players. BreakingT had a design for a T-shirt ready before the game even started and got it approved by Becca Roux, the executive director of the USWNTPA. Bonvissuto (full disclosure: He used to work as an SI.com editor) hit send on the first tweet announcing the sale of the тАЬ4 Stars OnlyтАЭ T-shirt (price: $28) at 10:17 p.m. ET on Wednesday, within minutes of the final whistle. тАЬAnd it hit like crazy,тАЭ he said. Goosed along by tweets from Alex Morgan, Ashlyn Harris and Allie Long, the sales were remarkable. Even though the shirts were available for only one hour and 43 minutes on Wednesday, that day was the best-selling day for direct-to-consumer sales in BreakingTтАЩs history. On Thursday came another record. тАЬ4 Stars OnlyтАЭ sold far more online than anything the company has ever produced, including all of the World Cup 2019 shirts and shirts commemorating the titles of the Washington Nationals and Kansas City Chiefs. When it came to тАЬ4 Stars Only,тАЭ Bonvissuto said, тАЬWe sold more than 5,000 units in the first 24 hours.тАЭ The USWNT players receive a portion of the proceeds, of course, but even on Wednesday night they anticipated what they might want to do with those. тАЬWe've already had conversations about where some of the proceeds from this could go, especially with the women's national team games being canceled in April,тАЭ Roux said. тАЬIs there a way for us to funnel money to those independent-contractor employees who would have otherwise received work for those two games? That was something the players brought up on Wednesday night before we knew how successful it would be after the game.тАЭ One of the challenges of having a T-shirt company that has to work fast off breaking news is getting the various clearances to do so, including from the legal side of things. BreakingT did another shirt on Julie ErtzтАЩs late game-winning goal against Spain (ERTZ SO GOOD). When it was pointed out on Twitter that the drawing of Ertz looked just like a shot taken by photographer Ashley Intile, the company ended up doing a royalty agreement with Intile. The success of the USWNT playersтАЩ own licensing ventures also shows that their ability to generate revenue goes far beyond what the federation has said and done with the team in the past. As Roux put it, тАЬThe players thought there was more in the market that wasnтАЩt being monetized. There was value being left on the table, while at the same time the federation was using an argument of revenue generation against them.тАЭ тАЬ4 Stars OnlyтАЭ is just the latest evidence. It wonтАЩt be the last. Novak Djokovic plans to make his return for the U.S. Open on Aug. 30 in New York, where he will look to win his 21st career major and a calendar Grand Slam. After an investigation, the Rockies said there was no racial slur directed toward Lewis Brinson. But after watching the video several times, the Marlins outfielder disagrees. Plus, why the Saints trading Michael Thomas would be unsurprising, a Jared Goff anecdote from the Lions' first practice in front of fans and more. Senior expert Michael Fabiano is full steam ahead in providing his redraft fantasy football rankings for the 2021 NFL season. Josh Sargent is headed to the Premier League after securing a transfer away from his first pro club. The Braves' Brian Snitker waited 40 years to get his shot. There may never be anyone like him againтАФand that may be exactly why heтАЩs had so much success. Luka Don─Нi─З is the first player to ever be eligible for a supermax rookie extension because he's already been selected first-team All-NBA twice.

2340,Councilwoman faces backlash after tweeting 'solidarity' for spreading coronavirus at Trump rallies,"Candi CdeBaca, Denver City Councilwoman, shared a meme suggesting those infected with coronavirus should attend """"MAGA"""" rallies. (Photo via www.denvergov.org) Democratic Denver City Councilwoman Candi CdeBaca faced conservative criticism Tuesday after sharing a meme on Twitter suggesting she stands in тАЬsolidarityтАЭ with the idea of spreading coronavirus at President TrumpтАЩs campaign rallies. """"These people are sick,"""" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted. CdeBaca, apparently posting in jest, had retweeted a meme that said: тАЬFor the record, if I do get the coronavirus IтАЩm attending every MAGA rally I can.тАЭ CdeBaca commented: тАЬ#solidarity Yaaaas!!тАЭ with laughing emojis. CdeBaca, based on her Twitter posts, appears to be a supporter of self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., one of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans quickly hit back, coming amid a partisan war of words over allegations that lawmakers are politicizing the response to the coronavirus. тАЬThis elected Democrat in Colorado doesnтАЩt seem very nice!тАЭ the Trump campaign War Room Twitter account posted in response. тАЬThe depths to which Democrats are sinking to politicize coronavirus is disgusting,"""" Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest said in a statement to Fox News on Tuesday. """"Democrat leaders, both nationally and in Colorado, need to condemn this deranged comment.тАЭ Later, CdeBaca's office called it a """"sarcastic tweet,"""" in a statement to a Denver ABC affiliate. The back and forth comes as the federal government grapples with the outbreak. Trump, over the weekend, authorized new travel restrictions and warnings in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The administrationтАЩs strict travel warning affects Iran, Italy and South Korea at this point. The virus has sickened 89,000 people across 66 countries, resulting in at least 3,061 deaths, including six in the U.S. Most of the deaths have occurred in mainland China. Trump, on Monday, was asked whether it was тАЬsafeтАЭ for him to continue to hold his campaign-style rallies as the country battles the virus. тАЬYou should ask the Democrats,тАЭ Trump said. тАЬTheyтАЩre all having rallies. TheyтАЩre campaigning.тАЭ He added: тАЬI think itтАЩs very safe.тАЭ Advertisement READ MORE @ FOXNEWS.COM This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ┬й2021 FOX Television Stations",0,0,0,0
2362,Joy Behar Says Trump Is 'Using Us;' Says He's Only Holding Press Briefings Because He Can't Hold Rallies ├втА╣тАа Flag And Cross,"Published on By   Joy Behar, co-host of The View, recently claimed that the only reason President Trump is doing so many press briefings is because with all of the coronavirus craziness he is unable to hold political rallies. This, of course, is just further hate spewing forth from Behar who has made it more than clear over the last several years that she is not a big fan of President Trump and his administration. HereтАЩs more from The Washington Examiner: Trending: Six City Council Members Hit with Recall Notice as Fed-Up Residents Take Matters Into Their Own Hands тАЬHe cannot have his тАШMAGAтАЩ Trump rallies anymore, where they tell him how wonderful he is,тАЭ Behar said during MondayтАЩs show. тАЬHe is using us instead of the MAGA rallies, and thatтАЩs why he makes these. He never made these when he was doing his rallies, and poor Dr. Fauci.тАЭ Behar, who is quarantining out of caution during the outbreak because her age puts her in a тАЬhigher-risk groupтАЭ of contracting the virus, made the statements on The View from a remote location after co-host Sunny Hostin addressed TrumpтАЩs daily updates to the press. тАЬIt seems to me that networks should not even be at this point broadcasting his 90 minutes of misinformation,тАЭ Hostin said. тАЬI understand why CuomoтАЩs on. ThatтАЩs one thing, but I almost think itтАЩs a disservice to the country at this point.тАЭ Behar later became rather gushy over Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying sheтАЩs тАЬfalling in loveтАЭ with him. Apparently, according to her, he used to annoy her, but now sheтАЩs calling him тАЬbrilliant.тАЭ It seems that Behar is just looking for any excuse possible to trash on the president. A person has every right to disagree with someone and state those disagreements, but the kind of anger and hostility that Behar has for Trump is ridiculously out of proportion. China Syndrome US Supports UNтАЩs Call For тАШImmediate Global CeasefireтАЩ Due To Coronavirus Pandemic NBC suffered its worst ratings disaster ever with the collapse of the woke 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Published on By  NBC suffered its worst ratings disaster ever with the collapse of the woke 2021 Tokyo Olympics. This yearтАЩs numbers came in worse than the 2016 ratings for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. According to the numbers, the games were an absolute disaster for NBC. It is so bad that the network has had to start giving extra ads to advertisers because the number of viewers have been far lower than the number that advertisers paid for. Per the Daily Wire: тАЬWhen you look at the numbers, itтАЩs hard to be pleased with them,тАЭ University of Alabama sports communications program director Andy Billings told the AP. тАЬItтАЩs probably NBCтАЩs worst-case scenario, but itтАЩs probably a worst-case scenario that they would have been able to predict months ago.тАЭ Fox News reported some of the OlympicsтАЩ disappointing numbers: тАЬNBCтАЩs primetime coverage of the Tokyo Olympics on July 26 averaged 14.7 million viewers тАФ for a 49% drop compared to the equivalent night from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and 53% less than the 2012 London Olympics. The opening ceremonies saw their lowest viewership since 1988.тАЭ AmericansтАЩ excitement for the Olympics has flagged along with other sports, and some experts are blaming an increase on athlete activism for the lack of interest in sporting events. тАЬAmericans approached the Games with a collective shrug. Thirty-six percent of those polled in late July by Monmouth University in New Jersey said they had less interest in the Olympics than usual, and 3% had more interest,тАЭ the AP reported. Americans did not care at all about the woke Olympics were every other athlete supposedly competing in AmericaтАЩs name turned out to hate America! It is long past time that these arrogant athletes and their sports organizations get taken down a notch and get their comeuppance. Follow WarnerтАж Two coaches at the U. of Oklahoma now say they have the right to take punitive action against students whose politics the coaches donтАЩt like. Published on By  Two womenтАЩs volleyball coaches at the University of Oklahoma now say they have the right to take punitive action against students whose politics the coaches donтАЩt like. Can you imagine? Now these hardcore leftist, anti-American тАЬeducatorsтАЭ are claiming that they can destroy a student simply because the kids practice wrong think outside the classroom. This is outrageous. The coachesтАЩ claims come in connection to a lawsuit filed by player Kylee McLaughlin who sued coaches Lindsey and Kyle Walton along with the OU Board of Regents alleging that she had been excluded from the team тАЬover her politically conservative views.тАЭ According to The College Fix, McLaughlin made political comments that the coaches didnтАЩt like and at one point, one of the coaches said that Kyle Walton told her that he wouldnтАЩt coach her any more. McLaughlin said in her lawsuit that the coaches тАЬbranded her as a racist and a homophobeтАЭ and her life became difficult at the school. The College Fix adds: According to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, in their motion to dismiss the Waltons argue that even though they were the ones who injected politics into the team, they have the right to discipline those with differing views тАФ in the name of тАЬteam unity.тАЭ тАЬWhile Plaintiff was free to make bigoted statements, she was not free from the consequences of how her teammates perceived those statements,тАЭ the WaltonsтАЩ motion states. тАЬThe First Amendment cannot force her teammates to trust Plaintiff or desire to play with her. Consequently, the Complaint makes clear that Coach Walton was within her rights to cultivate a winning тАШteam atmosphere by ensuring the players that тАШtrustтАЩ each other would be on the court.тАЭ In a nutshell: At a public university they can force players into volleyball-irrelevant political discussions тАж and to preserveтАж Welcome to the first stages of the informational oligarchy, folks.

2374,Choa Chu Kang riot: Teenager charged with possessing two knives and sickle,"Singapore Singapore Screengrabs of videos circulating on social media showing the riot. SINGAPORE: A teenager suspected to be linked to a riot in Choa Chu Kang last week was charged on Wednesday (Mar 4) with possessing dangerous weapons. Mohammad Helmi Parmadi, 17, is accused of possessing a watermelon knife, a bread knife and a sickle along the common corridor in front of Block 703 West Coast Road on Mar 2. Helmi was remanded for investigations and will return to court on Friday. If convicted, he faces a maximum jail term of three years and at least six strokes of the cane. He is suspected to be linked to a 13-man riot that took place at Block 102 Teck Whye Lane in broad daylight on Feb 27. Weapons including a knife, knuckle dusters, a metal bar and a metal rod that were believed to have been used in the fight were seized by the police. 13 MEN CHARGED The police said last week that they were alerted to a case of rioting at 10 Choa Chu Kang Way at about 1.30pm on Feb 27. The 13 men, aged between 17 and 28, were arrested in various locations including Jalan Bukit Merah, Yishun and Bukit Batok. They were charged on Feb 29 either with rioting with a deadly weapon or unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon. According to charge sheets, the riot was between two groups, with a group of eight men wanting to hurt the second group of five men and vice versa.

2399,Kentucky Basketball rallies past Florida Gators: 5 takeaways and postgame banter,"Filed under: The Cats fought until the end and completed an unbelievable 18-point comeback for the big-time win. The Kentucky Wildcats got a huge win against the Florida Gators 71-70 in Gainesville Saturday afternoon in the last game of the regular season. The Cats came out how many expected they might: flat. And it was clear early on as they went into the half down 40-30. After the break, it got ugly. The officiating was horrific. Cal got ejected, or so he thought, then returned to the bench. And the team seemingly fell apart. Related They fought back the last 10 minutes, but it looked all for naught. But then something happened. The Cats exploded for a huge 18-point comeback win. The energy and effort they put forward could not be questioned as the game winded down. They fought to the very end. And it all paid off. What a win!!! Wait, what happened? We blacked out Apparently though, we came back to win from an 18-point second-half deficit on the road at Florida pic.twitter.com/suqJvuQcU5 As the regular season comes to an end, the postseason is in sight. Kentucky will play at 1 p.m. ET on Friday in Nashville. March Madness is officially here. Hagans did not make the trip After the turmoil that ensued during KentuckyтАЩs second half collapse against the Tennessee Volunteers, there was rampant speculation and concern surrounding the team and Ashton Hagans. Well, that finally came to light this afternoon as John Calipari announced that Hagans did not even make the trip to Gainesville. Ashton did not make the trip with us to Florida. He and I met a couple days ago and he asked to step away for a couple days for personal reasons. I support his decision. We are going to need him at 100% for the postseason. While this isnтАЩt ideal heading into postseason play, the Cats need Hagans to make a deep run in the coming weeks. It looks like heтАЩs still being positive, though. LetтАЩs Get this Win Fellas!!! Love yтАЩall boyss Be back & Better!!! https://t.co/kRwLyDDzh0 Hopefully, this is just a blip on the radar and doesnтАЩt affect UK in the long term. These kinds of things tend to either tear a team apart, or bring them all together. They didnтАЩt respond well today, but weтАЩll see how they respond going forward. New starting five The last time I did this was because of Hagans and thatтАЩs the case again today. In the first matchup with the Gators, Hagans was coming off a thigh contusion and was questionable leading up to the game. He playedтАФquite a bit actuallyтАФbut Johnny Juzang earned his second start in his place. This time around, Keion Brooks was the one that earned the start. And Tyrese Maxey was running the point full-time for the first time in his short college career. The rest of the lineup remained the same, with the exception of Nate Sestina who started last game for the Senior Day festivities. The absence of Hagans meant UK was only able to play seven guys, but Calipari did mention that Dontaie Allen was available off the bench. Probably best not to burn his redshirt, though. The offense was stagnant, but recovered The offense was obviously stagnant without Hagans manning it. He makes mistakes and heтАЩs frustrating, but his ability to penetrate the defense and attack was clearly missing today. UK just couldnтАЩt get anything going. Florida changed up the defense time and time again and the Cats simply looked confused. They settled for jumpers and missed multiple point-blank shots. However, as the game went on, they fought back and it got much better. Enough to get a huge win on the road. Same with the defense HagansтАЩ absence was not only felt on the offensive end, but it was felt even more so on the defensive end. He is amazing at shutting players down, stealing passes, and disrupting the opposing teamтАЩs offense. That wasnтАЩt there today and Kentucky looked bad at times. Whether it was losing their man or giving up easy drives, they just couldnтАЩt stop the Gators. One thing that mightтАЩve had something to do with this was the fact that UK basically had seven guys to play the entire gameтАФassuming Cal didnтАЩt want to burn AllenтАЩs redshirt. That meant guys had to be careful not to foul and over-aggressiveness was probably discouraged. But in the final half of the game, the Cats continued to claw and scrape until they cleaned it up to shut down the Gators in the final 10 minutes, Sestina, Juzang, and Brooks gave some big-time minutes One positive was the play from the normal bench guys. Setina, Juzang, and Brooks all played very well today. They all have their flaws, especially defensively, but they gave Kentucky really, really GREAT minutes when they desperately needed it. All three of these guys played as hard as IтАЩve seen anyone play all season. They deserve the credit for keeping UK from getting blown out in this one. ThatтАЩs big moving forward because the Cats will need it over the next few weeks. Bench play is huge and they will need to give the starters a breather when necessary. Despite the frustrations today, these guys took advantage of the opportunities they were given. I was ready to say, тАЬLetтАЩs just throw this one out and forget it happened, deal?тАЭ But this team regrouped and straightened this thing out. What a game and what a win by UK. Go Cats!!!",0,0,0,0
2435,"'Evolving like Pokemon', Hong Kong women step up to protest frontlines","By Pak Yiu HONG KONG (Reuters) - University student 'A', says she used to be a 'typical girl' who liked to shop, drink bubble tea and watch Korean soap operas but all that changed as Hong Kong's anti-government protests gained momentum and she stepped up to take a place in the frontlines. She is now charged with rioting, an offence which carries a maximum ten year jail sentence, and is on bail awaiting trial. The protests began last June and at first, the frontlines were predominantly men. That started to gradually change and women began building roadblocks, throwing back tear gas cannisters as well as facing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds. The 22-year-old, who did not want to be identified for fear it could affect her trial, said her shift to the frontline came in stages. """"I was at the back, I would just go home after I marched. I started to think I could go further and further forward, till I was at the very front."""" At the frontlines, it can be hard to tell the difference between men and women among the black-clad protesters but 'A' says she felt a sense of female empowerment and gender equality when she came across other women - even if men sometimes tell women to retreat. In the past nine months, 7,165 people have been arrested, according to the city's Security Bureau. The protests have quietened down due to spread of the coronavirus, but there are signs the movement could again mobilise with at least three protests scheduled for Sunday. Although Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill, which sparked the protests, has been withdrawn, protesters have been marching for an investigation into police brutality and the downgrading of riot charges for those who have been arrested. The student says she believes more women could play a greater role in progressing the campaign for more democratic measures to be put in place across the city. """"Women should also come out for this. Men shouldn't be responsible for everything, women should also take some responsibility,"""" she said. """"We're no longer weak, or the ones with 'princess syndrome'. So I think now, we are evolving like Pokemon, we're on another level. We're different.""""

Canadian Pacific Railway on Tuesday upped its offer by $2 billion to $27.3 billion in cash and stock in a showdown with larger rival Canadian National Railway. That drove shares of Kansas City up 7% in early trading. Canadian Pacific shares fell, while Canadian NationalтАЩs rose. It all started in March, when Canadian Pacific reached a $25 billion deal to acquire Kansas City in the hopes of creating the first railroad linking Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. One month later, Canadian National swooped in with a higher bid. It and Kansas City then agreed on a nearly $30 billion deal thatтАЩs set for a shareholder vote on August 19. Canadian PacificтАЩs move marks a U-turn, since the second-biggest Canadian railroad operator had vowed in April not to raise its bid. Still, its latest offer is lower than that of Canadian National.

2438,Staten Island Amazon worker who planned protest amid coronavirus is fired,"Staten Island Amazon workers walk out STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The worker who helped organize a walkout at Staten IslandтАЩs Amazon fulfillment center on Monday said later in the day that he was fired by the company. Workers at the Bloomfield-based fulfillment center walked out during their lunch break to protest working conditions during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. With city police officers making sure protestors maintained a six-foot distance from each other, at least 50 people took part in the rally in front of the facility, known as JFK8 -- which has 5,000 workers. The facility is Staten IslandтАЩs largest employer. The rallyтАЩs organizer, Chris Smalls, an employee at the facility, said he was fired today. тАЬAmazon would rather fire workers than face up to its total failure to do what it should to keep us, our families, and our communities safe,"""" said Smalls. """"I am outraged and disappointed, but IтАЩm not shocked. As usual, Amazon would rather sweep a problem under the rug than act to keep workers and working communities safe. Today, I stood with my co-workers because conditions at JFK8 are legitimately dangerous for workers and the public. Amazon thinks this might shut me up, but IтАЩm going to keep speaking up. My colleagues in New York and all around the country are going to keep speaking up. We wonтАЩt stop until Amazon provides real protections for our health and safety and clarity for everybody about what it is doing to keep people safe in the middle of the worst pandemic of our lifetimes,тАЭ he added. However, Amazon said in a statement to the Advance/SILive.com that Smalls was released of his duties because he violated social distancing guidelines. тАЬMr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines and putting the safety of others at risk. He was also found to have had close contact with a diagnosed associate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and was asked to remain home with pay for 14 days, which is a measure weтАЩre taking at sites around the world,"""" said Amazon in a statement. тАЬDespite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, March 30, further putting the teams at risk. This is unacceptable and we have terminated his employment as a result of these multiple safety issues,тАЭ she added. In response to the termination, Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said: тАЬWorkers should be protected when speaking out about safety conditions during this crisis. They are performing a public service. It is unacceptable that Amazon has terminated Chris Smalls for doing that today rather than addressing their serious COVID-19 safety problems.тАЭ While Amazon workers on Staten Island are not unionized, they have sought to form a union in the past. Some of the groups that sponsored the protest on Monday also issued a joint statement about Smalls being fired. тАЬAmazon will give a lot of reasons for why Chris Smalls was fired today. But the facts stand: at midday today, Chris stood up and called out Amazon for failing to protect our safety and our health. Hours later, he was fired,"""" said a joint statement from Athena Coalition director Dania Rajendra, Make the Road NY co-executive director Deborah Axt and New York Communities for Change director Jonathan Westin. тАЬChris, along with many of his colleagues in New York and around the country, have dared to tell the truth about the dangerous conditions at Amazon facilities. We can only conclude that instead of listening to the people who are actually risking their lives on the frontlines, Amazon would rather they just shut up about Amazon working conditions, which are now a national public health concern,тАЭ said the joint statement. MONDAYтАЩS WALK OUT Amazon workers said they were protesting on Monday because the facility, known as JFK8, was not closed for deep cleaning after sources said that multiple workers had contracted the coronavirus. While it appeared there were at least 50 protesters at the walk out, Amazon said only about 15 of them were employed at the facility. A spokesperson for the Amazon facility wouldnтАЩt confirm the number of coronavirus cases and told the Advance on Saturday that the facility would not be closed for deep cleaning. Amazon said the confirmed cases at JFK8 are not linked to one another. And the workers who contracted the virus had no contact with each other, the company said. тАЬWorkers are really scared right now. As of this morning, it looks like there is another case in the warehouse. This brings it up to six or seven cases,тАЭ said Zack Lerner, the organizing director of New York Communities for Change, which helped stage the walkout with Made The Road New York. Both are grassroots organizations.

2557,Felon Busted With Guns On The Way To Salt Lake City Protest,"A pair of Utah men are behind bars after police found numerous weapons and social media posts threatening violence against officers. Authorities in West Valley, Utah say 27-year olds Yuri Silva and Christian Hernandez were pulled over on their way to a protest in Salt Lake City, and cops found several firearms in their vehicle, including what the Deseret News describes as an Uzi with a suppressor. In the home of Yuri Neves Silva, 27, of West Valley City, more weapons were found and seized. Information about a potential motive was not immediately available, but police believe the two were headed to the protests to cause trouble. тАЬWe had every reason to believe thatтАЩs what they intended to do,тАЭ Vainuku said. Silva had posted тАЬmultiple threats of violence against police, specifically Salt Lake City police and West Valley City policeтАЭ over social media and тАЬencouraged others to take up arms against police as well, and had reportedly listed the names and addresses of specific officers to be targeted,тАЭ she said. Silva was arrested for investigation of making a terroristic threat. Police say Silva was making multiple posts about harming police officers and was seen in one picture holding a gun, according to a police affidavit. SilvaтАЩs not a prohibited person, but the same canтАЩt be said for his buddy. Christian Hernandez is now facing felon in possession and drug charges after marijuana was found in the vehicle along with the firearms. As for SilvaтАЩs alleged threats, they seem to be pretty specific in their intent. тАЬIn one video posted on (Sunday), the suspect made a video showing himself mocking the Salt Lake City curfew, stating, тАШHands up donтАЩt shoot,тАЩтАЭ while also threatening to kill police officers, the affidavit states. тАЬThe suspect also made comments knowing officers were trying to follow his Facebook page and he directed officers to stay at home to protect their families, otherwise тАШwe will have no choice but to affiliate you with your тАж colleagues and their actions.тАЩ тАЬThe suspect also mentions a police officer who resides in his neighborhood and comments, тАШYou put that cop car in the garage real quick play boi,тАЩтАЭ according to the affidavit. According to police, Silva denies that he had any actual intent to harm police officers, but admitted that he hoped his social media posts would incite others to violence. That excuse may have been more believable if Silva and Hernandez hadnтАЩt had multiple firearms with them on their way to what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. Thankfully, things seem to be calming down in Salt Lake City after a weekend of violence. Protests on Tuesday were loud but lawful for the most part. One person was arrested at the state capitol after protests continued long past the curfew imposed by the mayor, but that was it. If Silva and Hernandez hadnтАЩt been apprehended, however, who knows how bad things would have gotten. The legitimate protesters may have issues with police, but they should be praising officers for their actions in thwarting what very well could have turned a peaceful protest into a bloodbath.

2597,"Extinction Rebellion Protests ""Climate Abuse"" With Topless Human Chain On International Women's Day ├втА╣тАа Elizabeth Johnston","Extinction Rebellion has done it again. It seems thereтАЩs no deed to embarrassing or asinine for this particular brand of climate hysteric to commit in their deluded plot to save humanity from global warming. While you might know them for gluing themselves to planes, trains, buildings, roads, and the gates of Downing Street, 31 female members of the group opted for a protest befitting the International WomenтАЩs Day on which it occurred: a topless human chain. Because what could possibly spread awareness and call world leaders to action better than a bunch of women standing around half-naked in the middle of a winter day in London? According to the Metro, the women stood on Waterloo Bridge with тАЬclimate rapeтАЭ and тАЬclimate murderтАЭ and other slogans painted on their bare chests. Sarah Mintram, a former teacher and participant in the protest explained that the rationale behind the topless protest is the dubious fact that women are suffering more than men due to violence caused by climate change. Yeah. Really. тАЬItтАЩs mainly women in poorer countries in the global south that are experiencing the increase in violence but this will be the reality for all women if the climate and ecological crisis continues to go unaddressed,тАЭ Mintram said. тАЬWe are here to raise the alarm about what is happening to our sisters around the world and to tell women in the UK the climate and ecological emergency is your issue,тАЭ she continued, тАЬIt will affect you as a woman if we do not persuade our government to take urgent action starting now.тАЭ тАЬAs part of a series of actions around the world, XR UK women formed a topless chain across Waterloo Bridge to highlight the vulnerability of women in the face of climate breakdown,тАЭ the group said in a tweet sharing the photos.  тАЬThe climate emergency is a womenтАЩs emergency,тАЭ the group continued. тАЬWe are here to highlight the increase in hardship, violence & rape already facing women in the global south as a result of the climate & ecological emergency.тАЭ  тАЬWhy is climate a womenтАЩs issue? A January 2020 report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that climate breakdown and environmental degradation are driving an increase in violence against women,тАЭ Extinction Rebellion said in a tweet explaining the protest. They cited a January 2020 report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which claimed that climate change was responsible for violence against women in the Southern Hemisphere. тАЬThe report found that deforestation and the degradation of land mean women have to travel further to collect the things they need, like firewood, and are exposed to violence, rape and abduction when they make these journeys,тАЭ the group continued. According to Breitbart, Extinction Rebellion has been plaguing LondonтАЩs Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for years. Their antics cost the capitolтАЩs police forceтАФand therefore taxpayersтАФan estimated ┬г37 million last year alone, more than double the ┬г15 million annual budget for the Violent Crime Taskforce.

Government vehicles set on fire. pic.twitter.com/fy69KbkHrJ Protests have been ongoing in Ladysmith since February, with incensed residents calling for the head of fraud and corruption accused Alfred Duma local municipality mayor Vincent Madlala, as well as bemoaning poor service delivery, water shortages and escalating violence between warring taxi associations. The Department of Social Development vehicles were torched on Wednesday evening, and although there is currently no leads on who the culprits are, eNCA report that evidence points to a petrol bomb attack. Roads going in and out of town have been barricaded with the carcasses of burnt-out trucks and minibus taxis that continue to enforce a total shutdown in the area. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala decried the loss of nearly R2 million a day with businesses, factories and transport operators rendered utterly unable to function amid the chaos. KZN MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the perpetrators of the attack on the government vehicles to be swiftly brought to justice. тАЬThe department has received a report and seen pictures with its six vehicles burnt by brazen criminals,тАЭ said Khoza. тАЬWe are shocked at this despicable act of vandalism, which is totally abhorrent, destructive and beyond any justification whatsoever.тАЭ тАЬThese vehicles are an important tool used to quickly respond and provide services to our needy communities,тАЭ she said. She said that the crime was just another in a long line of threatening acts committed against government employees in the area. тАЬThe torching of our vehicles is another form of threatening employees who have suffered a lot of hijackings in the past.тАЭ тАЬThe law must take its course wherever and whenever our properties are under threat. We urge police to investigate such criminal activities without fear or favour. No-one should do these despicable and morally reprehensible acts, despite any frustration,тАЭ she said. Police are investigating the matter. Do you have a news story for The South African?

2907,Anti-CAA protests were funded from Middle East: Delhi police,"Police granted custody of Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia Alumni president The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act held at Jamia Millia Islamia University and other parts of Delhi were funded from the Middle East, the Delhi Police told a local court on Monday. The Patiala House Courts later sent Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia alumni president who was arrested on Sunday, to 10-day police custody. тАЬFrom the interrogation of witnesses, it is revealed that accused Shifa Ur Rehman received funds from members of alumni association of Jamia Millia Islamia based in Middle East countries and he was co-coordinating at the protest sites,"""" the Delhi police said in its application demanding custody of Rahman. Police said Rahman's name had popped up during the questioning of Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Safora Zargar, Gulfisa, Tahir Hussain, and three members of the Popular Front of India (PFI). """"Shifa-Ul-Rehman is also found actively involved in a conspiracy hatched in setting up anti CAA/NPR/NRC protests at various sites in Delhi, giving hate speeches that led to the riots in February 2020 at various protest sites, i.e., Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur, Khureji, Inderlok and Hauz Rani,"""" it said. According to police, Rehman along with AAJMI members namely Areeb and Badre Alam and other members of Jamia Co-ordination Committee (JCC), had visited various protest sites in Delhi. The Delhi police told the court that during the investigation, names of some more suspects have come out and the accused should be questioned at length about those suspects to obtain their exact particulars. тАЬHuge money was also funded as well as spent by the conspirators to carry out these riots in Delhi,"""" the police said, adding that the custodial interrogation of Rahman is required to confront him with huge technical data and other evidence collected during investigation. At least 53 people died in Delhi in February as those opposing and favouring the new citizenship law clashed each other, leaving a trail of destruction in several areas of the national capital. The Special Cell of the Delhi Police is probing the larger conspiracy behind the riots. Copyright ┬й 2021 All rights reserved",1,3,0,0

Health-care workers are the only people standing between everyday citizens and the novel coronavirus тАФ even if those everyday citizens value their own personal freedom over things like public health, common sense or their own lives. That dynamic was on full display in Denver, Colo., over the weekend, where the United States got its own bizarre Tiananmen Square-like photo moment тАФ except instead of a protester standing up to a government tank, it was two health-care workers standing up to a тАЬLand of the freeтАЭ-loving couple in a truck. Video and photos circulating online show two people in scrubs and masks blocking a crosswalk to stop a procession of far-right protesters en route to the stateтАЩs Capitol, where many of their ilk were already violating physical distancing rules to call for an end to the coronavirus lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus. Remarkable scene at 12th and Grant, where two healthcare workers from a Denver-area hospital тАФ they declined to say which or give their names тАФ are standing in the crosswalk during red lights as a тАЬreminder,тАЭ they say, of why shutdown measures are in place. pic.twitter.com/7xTjXvGN2E тАФ Chase Woodruff (@dcwoodruff) April 19, 2020  The two counter-protesters тАФ a man and a woman тАФ could be seen standing in the path of a large silver pickup truck on Sunday, refusing to budge while the vehicleтАЩs occupants hurled a flurry of verbal abuse at them. A witness described them as тАЬnursesтАЭ in his video, although their exact professions are unknown. They told another witness they were health-care workers. READ MORE: Store boss flips off coronavirus hoarder asking for $10K toilet paper refund тАЬGo to China!тАЭ a middle-aged blonde woman in a U.S.A. shirt shouted at them from the pickup truck, while leaning out of the passengerтАЩs window. тАЬItтАЩs a free country! America the free!тАЭ she declared, before slapping a sign reading тАЬLand of the freeтАЭ onto the windshield. The two health-care workers did not move. Videos and photos of the incident have circulated widely on the internet, where many have called it a perfect encapsulation of the anxiety and frustration emerging around the COVID-19 pandemic. The illness has killed more than 40,000 people in the United States alone, while lockdowns meant to slow its spread have tipped the world into a major recession.
